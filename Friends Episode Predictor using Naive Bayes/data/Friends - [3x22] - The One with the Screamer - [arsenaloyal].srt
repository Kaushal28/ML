1
00:00:03,148 --> 00:00:04,638
Are you still on hold?

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,318
l was supposed to call my dad back
two hours ago.

3
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:09,019
Oh, yeah. He clicked on.

4
00:00:09,221 --> 00:00:12,190
Call him as soon as you get a chance.
He's at Flimbees.

5
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:13,680
What's Flimbees?

6
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:16,919
That's the word l use when
l can't remember the real thing.

7
00:00:18,463 --> 00:00:20,795
Okay, hang up! That's it. Come on!

8
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:23,126
No. That's what they want me to do.

9
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:26,030
My warranty expires tomorrow.
lf l don't get through...

10
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:28,900
...they won't fix my crappy,
broken phone for free!

11
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:31,302
We cannot let them win!
lt's us versus them!

12
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:32,874
Yes!

13
00:00:34,112 --> 00:00:35,101
l say hang up.

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,011
lt's Chandler and us
versus Monica and them.

15
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:41,209
-Hey.
-Hey.

16
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:44,480
l gotta double-check for tickets
tonight. Who got what?

17
00:00:44,756 --> 00:00:45,745
l have one.

18
00:00:45,924 --> 00:00:48,358
l need two. l'm bringing Pete.

19
00:00:48,727 --> 00:00:49,921
My boyfriend.

20
00:00:51,997 --> 00:00:54,090
l have a boyfriend now.

21
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:56,090
Two it is. How about you?

22
00:00:57,436 --> 00:00:59,370
Yeah, l also need two.

23
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:02,036
Really? Who's number two?

24
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:06,734
Whose Number Two? One of the more
difficult games sewer workers play.

25
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:10,841
No one, it's just this person.

26
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:12,876
Like a date-type person?

27
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:15,780
Yeah, kind of.
lt's this woman from work.

28
00:01:16,054 --> 00:01:18,921
l hope that won't be too weird.
Will it, Rach?

29
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:23,419
Not at all. l was actually
gonna bring someone myself.

30
00:01:23,895 --> 00:01:25,988
But you said one ticket.

31
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:31,668
l meant me plus one.

32
00:01:32,204 --> 00:01:34,832
Okay. Did you guys mean you plus one?

33
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:38,873
All right. l'll see you tonight.

34
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:40,100
Okay. Bye-bye.

35
00:01:40,345 --> 00:01:41,334
Bye-bye.

36
00:01:42,214 --> 00:01:43,374
Okay, l need a date!

37
00:01:45,384 --> 00:01:48,842
Oh, hey! You guys are finally
gonna get to meet Kate!

38
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:51,614
And l borrowed your cologne.
l hope she likes it.

39
00:01:51,857 --> 00:01:54,519
What are you doing?
She's seeing somebody.

40
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,058
Yeah, and l don't have any cologne.

41
00:01:57,896 --> 00:02:01,525
-Bottle next to the shaving cream.
-Worm medicine for the duck.

42
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:08,404
The One With the Screamer

43
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:55,415
-Here you go. You can wear this.
-Thanks. Okay.

44
00:02:57,389 --> 00:02:59,220
l'm setting the phone down.

45
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:01,790
But l'm still here.

46
00:03:02,828 --> 00:03:05,160
Just don't go anywhere.
l'm still here.

47
00:03:05,697 --> 00:03:09,758
Don't switch or anything, because
l'm right here. Just one sec.

48
00:03:11,203 --> 00:03:13,296
One sec. One second!

49
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:16,035
Wait! One second! Just....

50
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:18,733
What? Monica, l'm scared!

51
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:22,041
Honey, that's a sleeve.

52
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:25,809
And we also have a speakerphone.

53
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:29,248
Please stay on the line.
Your call is important to us.

54
00:03:29,554 --> 00:03:31,545
You gotta hang up.
We'll be late.

55
00:03:31,757 --> 00:03:34,419
Thank you for your patience.
You're the next caller.

56
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:37,092
Yes! Yes! l'm the next caller!

57
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:40,087
You were gonna have me hang up.

58
00:03:43,702 --> 00:03:45,932
Can you take a duck and a chick
to the theater?

59
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:48,027
Of course not.

60
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:51,371
l just wanted them to hear it
from somebody else.

61
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:57,415
All right, fellas, back to Nintendo.

62
00:04:05,657 --> 00:04:07,318
Oh, hi, how are you?

63
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:08,651
Good.

64
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:13,430
-Looks like we're the first ones here.
-Looks that way.

65
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:14,825
First ones here!

66
00:04:18,436 --> 00:04:21,064
Oh, Tommy, this is Ross.
Ross, Tommy.

67
00:04:21,273 --> 00:04:23,571
Oh, l'm sorry. This is Cailin.
Cailin--

68
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:24,831
Sorry.

69
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,502
And break!

70
00:04:30,782 --> 00:04:33,273
l think l'm gonna run
to the ladies' room.

71
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:35,715
-l'll join you.
-l'll get our seats.

72
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:39,579
Well, this is...

73
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:40,917
...awkward.

74
00:04:42,627 --> 00:04:45,289
Well, because Rachel and l
used to go out.

75
00:04:45,564 --> 00:04:47,225
Oh, l didn't know that.

76
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:52,231
Well, then this is awkward.

77
00:04:53,972 --> 00:04:56,497
-So, what do you...?
-l think we're here.

78
00:04:58,844 --> 00:05:00,744
Excuse me. l'm sorry.

79
00:05:00,946 --> 00:05:03,141
l think you may be in our seats.

80
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:06,507
No, l don't think so.

81
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:09,311
-Could we take a look at your ticket?
-Sure.

82
00:05:11,256 --> 00:05:13,986
Yeah. Yeah, see, this says, ''D-1 3'' ....

83
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,821
Oh, well, l thought that--

84
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:20,657
You thought? Well, that didn't
really work out for you. ldiot!

85
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:25,859
What are you, a moron?
lt says, ''D-1 3'' ! Okay?

86
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:29,230
You're surrounded by even numbers!
Does that give you a clue?

87
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,438
-The usher told me--
-The usher must be right!

88
00:05:32,777 --> 00:05:34,472
With all his training!

89
00:05:34,946 --> 00:05:36,072
Get out!

90
00:05:36,982 --> 00:05:37,971
Here!

91
00:05:41,753 --> 00:05:44,278
-Hey, man, you want the aisle?
-No, l'm good.

92
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:58,502
-There he is!
-There's our star!

93
00:05:58,803 --> 00:06:00,327
You were great!

94
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:01,800
So? What'd you think?

95
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:06,009
Almost as good as the play with
the two naked girls on the seesaw.

96
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:08,879
-l wasn't in that.
-l know.

97
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:13,112
l want you to meet everybody.
Everybody, this is Kate.

98
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:15,785
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Sweetheart!

99
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:19,712
Come!

100
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:25,791
So that's the girl you like.

101
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:30,628
l tell you, this guy
Rachel is with is crazy.

102
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:35,669
He viciously screamed at total
strangers. l think he's bad news.

103
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,735
Wait a minute. You don't like
the guy Rachel's dating?

104
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:42,305
Well, that's odd.

105
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:47,909
Oh, hey, Lauren. You guys, this is
Kate's understudy, Lauren.

106
00:06:48,186 --> 00:06:50,177
Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.

107
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:53,152
l ran into you in the hallway
in your building.

108
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:57,259
lt was right after l slept with Joey.
He dumped me the next day.

109
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,998
So how'd you guys meet?

110
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:05,233
The short version is, l pursued
her for a couple of months.

111
00:07:05,537 --> 00:07:08,563
Then l gave her a check for $20,000
and she was mine.

112
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:14,870
ln the long version, l dump him
for telling people the short version.

113
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:18,047
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!

114
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:21,743
You guys, this is my agent, Estelle.

115
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:23,181
How do you do?

116
00:07:23,388 --> 00:07:26,448
Oh, you two girls were outstanding!

117
00:07:26,992 --> 00:07:29,085
Do they have representation?

118
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:31,790
They weren't in the play.

119
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,461
We're not actors.

120
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:34,754
What a shame!

121
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:39,263
With her face and her chest,
l could really put something together.

122
00:07:41,506 --> 00:07:42,939
Could l borrow it?

123
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:47,243
Hi. Remember me?

124
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:50,608
Hi. Yeah. Tommy's in line
for the bathroom...

125
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:53,909
...and someone just cut.
l think he's gonna snap.

126
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,748
l'm gonna go.

127
00:07:57,122 --> 00:07:58,419
Go? Why?

128
00:07:58,623 --> 00:08:01,421
l don't know. Could be
because l don't feel like...

129
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:04,821
...waiting all night for a guy
who may or may not scream.

130
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:09,492
He definitely will scream.

131
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:11,961
Goodbye.

132
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:17,799
Here we go, people!

133
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:25,839
''Boxing Day.

134
00:08:26,785 --> 00:08:28,719
The Lucille Lortel Theatre....

135
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:35,485
Joey Tribbiani gives
an uneven performance.

136
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:39,191
But Mr. Tribbiani is not the worst
thing in this production.''

137
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:40,455
Yes!

138
00:08:44,202 --> 00:08:48,571
''Kate Miller's awkward and mannered
portrayal is laughable.''

139
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:52,138
Here it is! ''The direction...

140
00:08:52,377 --> 00:08:55,642
...by Marshall Townend is....''

141
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:03,513
Thank you, boys and girls.

142
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:06,417
You've ruined my life.

143
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:10,149
Please stuff your talentless faces...

144
00:09:10,395 --> 00:09:12,761
...with my mother's crab cakes!

145
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:14,926
Excuse me!

146
00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:22,706
Does anyone mind if l save this?

147
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,110
-ls the play over?
-Where were you?

148
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:34,379
Thank you for your patience.
You're the next caller.

149
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:38,279
You were ''the next caller'' hours ago.
You must be going crazy.

150
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:40,717
l've kept myself busy.

151
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,364
Okay, yeah, l put your stuff in
her room and her stuff in your room.

152
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:00,500
You okay?

153
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:02,768
Fabulous.

154
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:07,883
Drama critics, they're nothing but
people who couldn't make it as actors.

155
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:10,451
-You know what to do?
-Become a drama critic.

156
00:10:15,393 --> 00:10:16,792
l am hurt!

157
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:21,162
A plague...

158
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:23,728
...on both your houses!

159
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:29,898
By the way, he dumped me tonight
after he read my review.

160
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:31,904
Oh, classy.

161
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:36,012
l sure know how to pick them.

162
00:10:37,682 --> 00:10:40,742
You know l gave up a part
on a soap for this?

163
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:44,583
l gave up a job too.

164
00:10:45,123 --> 00:10:48,092
-Really? What?
-Declawing cats.

165
00:10:50,128 --> 00:10:52,790
Hey, tell you what,
let me walk you home.

166
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:57,195
We'll stop by every newsstand and burn
every copy of The Times and The Post.

167
00:10:57,502 --> 00:10:59,800
-Why The Post?
-You didn't see The Post?

168
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:02,802
-No. You?
-No. Why?

169
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:13,182
You really think these newspapers
are just jealous of me?

170
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:16,717
Absolutely. You're talented
and you're good-looking.

171
00:11:17,188 --> 00:11:19,713
You're sweet and cute.

172
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:22,357
l know. That's why they trashed me.

173
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:31,693
-Wait. Wait a minute.
-What?

174
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:35,502
l don't get you.

175
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:37,698
l mean, first you hate me.

176
00:11:37,976 --> 00:11:40,638
Then you sleep with me.

177
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:43,913
Then you want nothing to do with me.
Now you want me again?

178
00:11:44,148 --> 00:11:46,708
You never went out
with an actress before?

179
00:11:48,219 --> 00:11:50,915
Kate, do you even like me?

180
00:11:53,825 --> 00:11:57,420
-Of course l do.
-So how come you blew me off?

181
00:11:57,662 --> 00:12:01,063
-How come you were with him?
-l don't know.

182
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:03,496
l just do this.

183
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:07,027
l always have to pick, like,
the smartest guy...

184
00:12:07,272 --> 00:12:08,864
...or the most talented guy.

185
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,608
Why can't l just
pick someone like you?

186
00:12:15,847 --> 00:12:16,939
Thanks.

187
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:20,874
You know what l mean.

188
00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:25,220
l mean, like, the sweetest guy.

189
00:12:26,758 --> 00:12:28,419
You're just so....

190
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:30,887
You're so...

191
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,197
...so....

192
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:47,705
Here we go.
Let's get your feet up there.

193
00:12:55,553 --> 00:12:56,952
Good night.

194
00:12:58,122 --> 00:12:59,487
Sweet dreams.

195
00:13:06,297 --> 00:13:09,755
l'm gonna put this can right here
in case you have to hurl.

196
00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:21,104
Please stay on the line.
Your call is very important to us.

197
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,513
You've been up for 24 hours.
Go to sleep.

198
00:13:25,783 --> 00:13:26,943
This isn't healthy.

199
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:28,846
No, no, l'm fine.

200
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:32,488
And you know why?
Because of all the riboflavin.

201
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:39,920
Didn't you have that on last night?

202
00:13:40,765 --> 00:13:42,756
l stayed at Kate's
but nothing happened.

203
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:46,764
Yeah, last time l was
at Pete's we just watched a movie...

204
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:48,838
...of us...

205
00:13:51,142 --> 00:13:52,632
...that we'd made earlier.

206
00:13:53,044 --> 00:13:56,411
l'm sorry, l can't help it.
l have a boyfriend.

207
00:13:57,882 --> 00:13:59,406
Hey, where were you?

208
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,416
l'm so, so sorry.
l am definitely gonna see your play.

209
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:07,157
l swear, your play is very important
to us. Thank you for your patience.

210
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:10,327
Your play is the next play
l'm gonna see.

211
00:14:12,196 --> 00:14:13,527
How'd it go with Kate?

212
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:14,687
lt was great!

213
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:19,530
l walked her home, and it was
amazing how much we connected.

214
00:14:19,737 --> 00:14:21,170
Then she passed out.

215
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,168
But then she woke up.

216
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:25,807
And we stayed up all night talking.

217
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,205
And now we're crazy about each other!

218
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:31,280
You had ''the night'' !

219
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:35,409
When two people realize
their feelings for each other...

220
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,181
...and they talk for hours and learn
all about the other person.

221
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:40,448
You think?

222
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:43,592
-Did you learn about her family?
-Two brothers. One died!

223
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:44,750
Yes!

224
00:14:51,969 --> 00:14:53,960
This is from the woman at the bar.

225
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:01,473
Sorry. She thought
you were somebody else.

226
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:06,583
-What time is it?
-One.

227
00:15:06,784 --> 00:15:08,251
7:1 5.

228
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:10,720
Watch doesn't work.

229
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:15,254
Tommy's supposed to be here soon.
We're going to lunch.

230
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:21,596
Look, l wasn't gonna
say anything to you, but....

231
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:25,462
All right, l don't think
you should be seeing Tommy anymore.

232
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:27,833
You don't?

233
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:32,406
The guy is mean. l mean, really mean.
l think you should stay away from him.

234
00:15:33,611 --> 00:15:36,944
Or maybe l should stay away
from all men.

235
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:39,680
lt's not just because l'm jealous.

236
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:43,787
l mean, l'm not. l'm not jealous.

237
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:48,916
Look, the guy actually screamed
at this couple sitting in our seats.

238
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,526
Yeah, and at the end of the play...

239
00:15:51,963 --> 00:15:56,764
...he got up, and he just started,
like, banging his hands together.

240
00:15:59,203 --> 00:16:01,797
You don't want to believe me,
that's fine.

241
00:16:02,006 --> 00:16:03,166
We're kidding.

242
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:09,138
No one believe me.
l'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny!

243
00:16:09,447 --> 00:16:12,348
-Sorry, Tommy.
-What's in the cup?

244
00:16:13,985 --> 00:16:16,180
What is in the cup?

245
00:16:16,387 --> 00:16:17,479
Okay, it's coffee.

246
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:19,986
lced coffee?
Tell me it's iced coffee.

247
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:24,183
-lt's hot--
-Hot coffee!

248
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:28,287
You idiot! You gonna spill
hot coffee all over me, huh?

249
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:33,027
What are you? Just a big, stupid
doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?

250
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:39,908
What's your favorite thing
about summertime?

251
00:16:40,211 --> 00:16:44,204
Going to the beach
when it stays light real late.

252
00:16:49,153 --> 00:16:51,314
What's your favorite thing
about summer?

253
00:16:52,323 --> 00:16:55,486
l don't know. Probably the smell
of freshly cut grass.

254
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,521
That's a good one.

255
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:06,496
Sorry! Sorry l'm late! My duck and
my chick had a fight. lt was ugly.

256
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:09,336
We held the curtain for you.
Let's go!

257
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:17,839
Vic! Where have you been, baby?

258
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,086
Where's Kate?

259
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:24,686
She got a job in L.A.

260
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:32,427
l've been waiting up all night
for you. Where have you been?

261
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:35,731
Where have you been, Vic?

262
00:17:37,735 --> 00:17:41,694
Go to the window. l wanna run down
to the truck and show you something.

263
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:46,407
What do you got down there, Vic?

264
00:17:46,644 --> 00:17:49,204
What do you got under that tarp?

265
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:53,341
When is she leaving?

266
00:17:53,651 --> 00:17:56,313
Tonight. What are you doing?

267
00:17:57,888 --> 00:17:59,150
l'm coming up!

268
00:18:03,594 --> 00:18:07,291
Hey, you hanging in there?

269
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:10,662
You doing okay?

270
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:13,326
You listening to me?

271
00:18:13,504 --> 00:18:15,165
Okay.

272
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:19,639
lf Pete calls again,
and you don't put him through...

273
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,971
...l will kill you.

274
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:24,376
Hey, you mind if l use the phone?

275
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,348
Use ours across the hall
because she...

276
00:18:32,657 --> 00:18:33,988
...has problems.

277
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:35,214
Thanks.

278
00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:39,284
Sorry, Tommy.

279
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:42,327
l almost spilled this
hot coffee on you.

280
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:45,095
Yeah, but you didn't.

281
00:18:45,403 --> 00:18:46,563
No, but...

282
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:48,332
...it's hot.

283
00:18:52,143 --> 00:18:54,737
Would you stop it?
lt's getting really old.

284
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:56,913
l can't believe no one believes me.

285
00:18:57,281 --> 00:18:58,771
l do. l believe you.

286
00:18:59,183 --> 00:19:00,172
You do?

287
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:03,784
Yeah. But l also believed her
when she said l was next.

288
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:13,421
Hey there, little fella.

289
00:19:13,664 --> 00:19:15,962
Mr. Fuzzy Man, how you doing?

290
00:19:20,337 --> 00:19:21,304
Gross!

291
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:22,861
ldiot!

292
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:26,876
Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!

293
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:31,012
''Oh, look at me! l'm so cute!
l'm a little chick who's disgusting!''

294
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:33,773
You're so stupid!
How are you not yet extinct?

295
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:38,616
What are you quacking about?

296
00:19:39,056 --> 00:19:40,683
Dumb Donald Dodo!

297
00:19:44,795 --> 00:19:47,127
Step away from the duck.

298
00:19:50,568 --> 00:19:52,627
Sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.

299
00:19:52,837 --> 00:19:54,828
Sorry you went doody in my hand!

300
00:19:57,908 --> 00:20:00,069
l guess we're not going out anymore.

301
00:20:00,311 --> 00:20:01,335
Man!

302
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:09,583
Joey, l'm so glad l caught you.
l couldn't find you before.

303
00:20:09,954 --> 00:20:11,854
What's all this about L.A.?

304
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:14,123
They still want me
for General Hospital.

305
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:15,314
But...

306
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,125
...what about us?

307
00:20:18,496 --> 00:20:20,521
Last night was wonderful.

308
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,658
But l can't stay here just for you.

309
00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:26,770
So stay for the museums.

310
00:20:27,638 --> 00:20:29,868
-l'm sorry.
-Joey, on-stage!

311
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:32,701
At least stay till the end
of the play.

312
00:20:32,943 --> 00:20:35,776
l'll go to the airport with you.
l want to say goodbye.

313
00:20:36,013 --> 00:20:37,446
Where are you, Vic?

314
00:20:37,948 --> 00:20:40,212
Flight's in an hour.
l gotta go.

315
00:20:40,451 --> 00:20:41,816
Vic?

316
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,108
Vic?

317
00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:46,386
-Vic!
-ln a minute!

318
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:51,459
So this is it, Victor?

319
00:20:52,363 --> 00:20:54,558
Yeah. l guess it is.

320
00:21:01,572 --> 00:21:02,596
Listen...

321
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:08,275
...l gotta say goodbye, and l gotta say
it quick because this is killing me.

322
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:13,475
One thing you gotta know
is that l will never forget you.

323
00:21:13,717 --> 00:21:16,584
But you got things
you have to do now.

324
00:21:17,221 --> 00:21:18,381
And so do l.

325
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:21,582
And so...

326
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:26,495
...l'm gonna get on
this spaceship...

327
00:21:33,904 --> 00:21:38,238
...and l'm gonna go to Blaargon-7
in search of alternative fuels.

328
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:42,442
But when l return
200 years from now...

329
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,175
...you'll be long gone...

330
00:21:45,816 --> 00:21:47,841
...but l won't have aged at all.

331
00:21:51,422 --> 00:21:54,914
So you tell your great,
great granddaughter...

332
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:56,520
...to look me up.

333
00:21:58,596 --> 00:21:59,995
Because, Adrianne...

334
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:01,787
...baby...

335
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:06,160
...l'm gonna want to meet her.

336
00:22:13,978 --> 00:22:15,673
So long, Vic!

337
00:22:22,486 --> 00:22:24,954
lt's been two days.

338
00:22:25,656 --> 00:22:26,714
Yeah, l know.

339
00:22:27,324 --> 00:22:30,316
Good thing it's one of those
801 numbers, right?

340
00:22:30,628 --> 00:22:35,565
Phoebe, 800 is toll free.
801 is Utah.

341
00:22:38,102 --> 00:22:42,732
lt has to be 800 because all those
big companies have 800 numbers.

342
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:43,962
Every....

343
00:22:44,942 --> 00:22:48,275
Yeah, every big Utah-based company
has one.

344
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:52,639
Sorry. l'm so sorry.
l will pay you back.

345
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,946
And yet she's still not
hanging up the phone.

346
00:22:56,153 --> 00:22:57,814
-Hang up!
-Hang up the phone!

347
00:22:58,122 --> 00:22:59,521
