1
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:14,010
-What are you guys doing up?
-Finishing the crossword.

2
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:17,745
Do you know a six-letter
word for "red"?

3
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,010
Dark red.

4
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:25,655
Wrong, but there's a connect-the-dots
in here for you later.

5
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,024
Hey, how about maroon?

6
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:32,526
Yes! You are so smart!

7
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,865
You guys are so cute.

8
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,125
I know.

9
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,030
See you in the morning.

10
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,951
I love doing crossword
puzzles with you.

11
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,112
Me too.

12
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,691
Now let's finish this
and go to bed.

13
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,458
Only one left.

14
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,165
Three-letter word.
Not dog, but....

15
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,629
Cat.

16
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,466
You are so smart!

17
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:17,031
I love you.

18
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,708
I love you too.

19
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,789
The One with the Cop

20
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,708
We still need a tip.

21
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,345
All right. Hold on.

22
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:28,945
I got it.

23
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:30,907
Nickel.

24
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,419
-How much do we need?
-Couple of bucks.

25
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,180
Okay, dime.

26
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:40,415
You guys keep talking.
This could take a while.

27
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:41,853
Wait, look it!

28
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,564
This is a police badge!

29
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:49,792
Cool. But why would a cop come
in here? They don't serve doughnuts.

30
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:55,872
Could you discover the badge again?
I can do better than that.

31
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,202
I bet somebody's
missing that badge.

32
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,710
I should take it back.
But at the police station...

33
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,883
...I'll check their 10 Most Wanted List.

34
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:08,884
My friend's been number 11 forever.
This could be her year!

35
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,786
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey, Joey.

36
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,663
Is that my sweatshirt?

37
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:22,231
Yes, it is. I'm sorry.
I was cold. I hope it's okay.

38
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,995
It's just that if you wear
someone's sweatshirt...

39
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,467
...shouldn't it be your boyfriend's?

40
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,106
And I'm not him.

41
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,812
I'm sorry.
I'll give it back.

42
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,175
It's gonna be all
smelling like Monica.

43
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,279
Do I smell bad?

44
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,913
You smell like a meadow.

45
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,180
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:50,519
What's with him?

47
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:55,131
The last time Joey went to a meadow
his mother was shot by a hunter.

48
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,402
Look what I found.
It's a police badge.

49
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,839
What's that doing here?
I don't see any doughnuts.

50
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,675
Cops and doughnuts.
Come on.

51
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,644
If Chandler had said it
you'd all be on the floor.

52
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:15,285
Cops, doughnuts? Me?

53
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,233
I still don't know.

54
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:39,344
I want to make sure I bought
the right couch, one that says...

55
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:43,879
..."Kids welcome here,"
but that also says...

56
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,583
..."Come here to me."

57
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,489
What? You say that to kids?

58
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,188
The "Come here to me" is,
you know, for the ladies.

59
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,159
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch,
it's not a magic couch.

60
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,569
Well, you picked a great couch.

61
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,397
-Sign here, please.
-Sure.

62
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:13,535
The delivery charge
is almost as much as the couch!

63
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,749
That's ridiculous.
He lives three blocks away.

64
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,849
I'll take it myself.
Thank you.

65
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,214
All right, Rach, come on.
Let's go.

66
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,726
Are you kidding?

67
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:35,694
Come on. It's only three blocks.
It's not very heavy. Try it.

68
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,940
Oh, I can do it.

69
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,936
You two will really
enjoy that couch.

70
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,874
We're not together.

71
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,912
Something didn't quite add up there.

72
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,056
What's that supposed to mean?

73
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,928
Well, you. Her.

74
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,928
I mean, she's very...

75
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,394
...you know.

76
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,999
And you're, like...

77
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:11,625
...you know?

78
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,641
Not that it's any of your business,
but we did go out.

79
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,243
Really? You two?

80
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,972
I don't want to do this now.
I'm carrying a heavy couch.

81
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,515
Then tell him quickly.

82
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,951
Fine. We went out.

83
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,453
Not only did we go out...

84
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,592
...we did it 298 times!

85
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,530
You kept count?
You are such a loser!

86
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,538
A loser you did it with 298 times!

87
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:59,279
Excuse me, ma'am. You can't put
your cigarette out on a tree.

88
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,211
Yeah, I can.
It worked well.

89
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,181
But you shouldn't.
So don't ever do that again.

90
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,326
I won't. Till I have
my next cigarette.

91
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,789
Hold it!

92
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,962
N.Y.P.D. Freeze, punk!

93
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,060
That's right. You are so busted.

94
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,728
Book them.

95
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,565
-Who are you talking to?
-Save it, red!

96
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,812
Apologize to the tree or
spend the night in the slammer.

97
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,882
I am not apologizing to a tree.

98
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:35,079
You apologize to the tree right now
or I am calling for backup.

99
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,717
Backup! Backup!

100
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,652
I'm sorry! Sorry!

101
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,920
Okay, cancel backup!
Cancel backup!

102
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,029
Didn't you say there was
an elevator in here?

103
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes, I did, but there isn't.
Here we go!

104
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,473
Don't you think we should rethink
the whole hiring movers thing?

105
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,338
No way. They're a rip-off.

106
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:03,209
They check out your stuff
and come back later and steal it.

107
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,647
It's true. I saw it on Dateline.

108
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,617
Jane Pauley is the one woman
I would kiss.

109
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,717
-There's just something about her.
-Rach, can we concentrate?

110
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:19,257
Yeah, fine.
I listened to your dumb story.

111
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,195
Okay, go left.

112
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,026
Left. Left.

113
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,033
Okay, you know what?
There's no more left left.

114
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,939
Lift it straight up over your head.

115
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,371
Straight up. You can do it!

116
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,942
You can do it!

117
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,704
Okay. You got it?

118
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,472
-Go, go.
-Good, good.

119
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,777
You got it, right?
You got it, right? You got

120
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,458
Any chance you think
it looks good there?

121
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,491
This guy was all:

122
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,859
And I'm all,
"Buffay! Homicide!"

123
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,330
It was just so cool!

124
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:03,638
-You were supposed to take it back.
-I'm having fun doing good deeds.

125
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,475
You can get arrested
for impersonating a police officer.

126
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,174
You could get arrested
right now!

127
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:16,713
I'd better take it back.
I'm totally drunk with power.

128
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,225
Yeah. I didn't know
you guys would be here.

129
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,064
-Do me a favor. Taste this.
-What? Why?

130
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,634
It's okay, Joe, she's a trained chef.

131
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,002
Actually, I was looking for Phoebe.

132
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,908
Well, you just missed her.

133
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,409
Was that her?

134
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,183
-I gotta go.
-Joey, wait a minute. Wait.

135
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,788
-What is with you?
-Nothing.

136
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,619
You're acting strange.

137
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,186
All right. There is something.

138
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,363
I kind of had a dream.

139
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,463
But I don't want to talk about it.

140
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,567
What if Martin Luther King
had said that?

141
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,832
I kind of have a dream.

142
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,970
I don't want to talk about it.

143
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,046
Look, it involved Monica.

144
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,048
You had a dream about the girl I'm seeing?
Cool.

145
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,515
I dreamt about the girls he was seeing.

146
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:27,021
Let's talk about your dream.
I love you. Your dream?

147
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,988
There was no sex.
I haven't dreamt of her like that...

148
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,892
...since I found out
about you two. More or less.

149
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,763
What was the dream about?

150
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:46,670
You were my girlfriend.
We were doing the crossword puzzle.

151
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,709
Like you did last night.

152
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:52,111
That's it. I'm in love
with Monica. I'll move out.

153
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:56,081
Joey, come on. That doesn't mean
you're in love with me.

154
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:57,880
It doesn't?

155
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,785
It could mean anything.
Like...

156
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,460
...you're jealous that I've become
the apartment stud.

157
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,092
Sounds like your dream.

158
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:13,761
Or it could mean you saw Chandler
and me being close and stuff...

159
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,803
...and you want that too.

160
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,938
In the dream
I did enjoy the closeness.

161
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,775
If that's what it was, that'd be great.
I wouldn't have to move.

162
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,308
Are you attracted to Monica?

163
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:30,248
Right here, right now,
are you attracted to her?

164
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,516
-Not really.
-There you have it!

165
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:38,195
Well, sure!
I'm just wearing sweats!

166
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:40,791
But that's good!

167
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,128
You're not in love with me.
You just want a girlfriend.

168
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,930
It's not just about
getting a girlfriend.

169
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:51,769
I could get a girlfriend.
We could sit and do crossword puzzles.

170
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,844
But could we have
the closeness like you have?

171
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:59,306
Monica and I were friends
before we dated. Maybe that's it.

172
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,520
Friends first?

173
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,279
That's interesting.

174
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,187
-You become friends after?
-No, never done that either.

175
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,692
Do you guys have a tape measure?

176
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,229
Yeah. It's actually in my bedroom.

177
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,134
That's right.

178
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,640
What's up, Joey?

179
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,980
How you doing?

180
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,998
Excuse me. Is this your car?

181
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,394
Don't park here.
You're blocking the entrance.

182
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,569
Don't worry.
It's not a problem.

183
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:57,675
It's a problem for me, so it's a
problem for you, because I'm a cop.

184
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,410
So am l.

185
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,714
Okay. So you're a cop.
You can park anywhere.

186
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,914
I know, because I'm a cop too.

187
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,557
Keep up the good work. 10-4.

188
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,559
Wait. So, what precinct are you with?

189
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,293
I'm with the 57th.

190
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,866
-I know a guy in Homicide up there.
-I'm in Vice.

191
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,562
In fact, I'm undercover
right now. I'm a whore.

192
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,638
Who else is in Vice there?

193
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,641
Do you know...

194
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,108
...Sipowicz?

195
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,973
Sipowicz? I don't think so.

196
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,311
Yeah. Sipowicz. Yeah.
Big guy, kind of bald.

197
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,620
I don't know him.

198
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,124
Don't try to call him.
He's not there. He's out.

199
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,920
His partner just died.

200
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,896
Tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry
for his loss.

201
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,592
I sure will. Take care.

202
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,432
By the way, I'm sure
Sipowicz will be all right.

203
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,575
I heard that kid from Silver Spoons
is really good.

204
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,409
Where'd you find my badge?

205
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:23,484
Could you give me and Ross
a hand moving his couch?

206
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:27,154
I'd love to, but I got acting class.
But you know what?

207
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,496
I guess I could blow that off.
For you.

208
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:40,108
Let me ask you something.
I was talking with Monica and Chandler.

209
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,212
Boy, they are really tight.

210
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,437
I know.

211
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,549
That's not a bad situation
they got there.

212
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,053
Think I'll get me one of those.

213
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,690
What's up, Joe?

214
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,624
I think Monica and Chandler
are so great...

215
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,391
...because they were friends first.

216
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,967
So I asked myself, who are my friends?
You and Phoebe.

217
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,503
I saw you first, so....

218
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:16,138
-What are you saying?
-Maybe you and I crank it up a notch.

219
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,577
You know, honey...

220
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,152
...as flattered as I am...

221
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,018
...that you saw me first...

222
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:31,592
...I just don't think we should be
cranking anything up.

223
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,363
I'll treat you real nice.

224
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,538
Yeah. Well, you know....

225
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:50,371
I think it's a great idea to become
friends with someone before you date.

226
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:54,744
But the way you do it is you
meet someone, become their friend...

227
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,412
...build a foundation,
then ask them out on a date.

228
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,125
Don't hit on your existing friends.

229
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,396
Won't that take longer?

230
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,967
Oh, but once you find it...

231
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,294
...it's so worth the wait.

232
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,734
I understand.

233
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:16,965
Good.

234
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,537
Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first.

235
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,275
Come here to me.

236
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,584
No, no. You come here to me.

237
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,155
-I brought reinforcements.
-Great! You brought Joey?

238
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:37,793
The next best thing.

239
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:44,100
You brought Chandler?
The next best thing would be Monica!

240
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:49,139
I would be offended, but Monica
is freakishly strong, so....

241
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,276
I drew a sketch
of how we'll do it.

242
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,412
Rach, that's you.

243
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,672
That's the couch.

244
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,915
What's that?

245
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,641
That's me.

246
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,288
Certainly think a lot of yourself.

247
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,962
No. That's my arm.

248
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,432
I see. I thought you just really,
really liked your new couch.

249
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,203
Just follow my lead.

250
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,609
Come on, Chandler.

251
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,446
-All right.
-Okay.

252
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,150
Here we go.

253
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,383
All right. Ready?

254
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:37,846
Turn!

255
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,079
Turn!

256
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,383
Turn!

257
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,690
-I don't think we can turn any more!
-I don't think it'll fit!

258
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,332
Yeah, it will.
Come on! Up, up, up!

259
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,135
Up! Yes!

260
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,001
Here we go! Pivot!

261
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,397
Pivot!

262
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,234
Pivot!

263
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,200
Pivot!

264
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,207
Pivot!

265
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,472
Pivot!

266
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,414
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

267
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,192
I don't think it'll pivot any more.

268
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,825
You think?

269
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:22,930
All right, let's bring it
back down and try again.

270
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,500
I think it's really stuck now.

271
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,606
-I can't believe that didn't work.
-I know. Me neither.

272
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,544
I mean, you had a sketch.

273
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,089
What did you mean when
you said "pivot"?

274
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,688
Man, I cannot figure this out.

275
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,867
Yeah, because it's not 1985.

276
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:02,495
You guys, guess what?
I ditched a cop.

277
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,068
-What?
-What do you mean?

278
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,006
He caught me using his badge
and he tried to bust me.

279
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,647
Damn real cops!

280
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,346
How far did he chase you?

281
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:15,317
Well, he didn't really. He just picked up
his badge and stood there.

282
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,684
Maybe we'll see you on
World's Most Boring Police Chases.

283
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,490
-Why did you run?
-I had to.

284
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:27,154
You know, impersonating a cop
is like a Class E felony.

285
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,597
Two to four years minimum.
I am not going back to that hellhole.

286
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,607
If I can just get it to pivot...

287
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,869
...we'll be back on track.

288
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,979
-Rach, can I get some help please?
-Yeah.

289
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,580
Turn it off! Turn it off!

290
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:56,325
Maybe the firemen can help us
move the couch when they get here.

291
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:01,259
-Wait, wait, wait.
-It's a new couch! It's a new couch!

292
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,434
How's it going?
Make any new friends?

293
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,702
Yeah.
I met this woman.

294
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,942
What's she like?

295
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,640
Well, she's...

296
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,284
...really good in bed.

297
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:27,355
-You were going to be friends first.
-Hey, it's all your fault.

298
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,515
Why?

299
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,663
You didn't give me advice.
You gave me a pickup line.

300
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:35,697
I told her I wanted to build a foundation
and be friends first.

301
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:40,702
Suddenly, through no fault of my own,
I became irresistible to her!

302
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,035
And her roommate.

303
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,905
What about the closeness?

304
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:51,712
Closeness, schmosness. There was
three of us, for crying out loud!

305
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,979
Who wants pizza?

306
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,656
I do! I do! I do!

307
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:04,226
This is great! Can you believe
I found it on the second floor?

308
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,167
-Who is it?
-N.Y.P.D.

309
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,390
Oh, my God!

310
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,429
Just a minute, officer!

311
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:27,582
-I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay.
-My God, it's him! It's that cop!

312
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:31,755
-I can't believe he found me!
-Are you gonna go to jail?

313
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:35,124
If I go down,
you guys go down with me.

314
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,720
Harboring a fugitive?
That's one to three years minimum.

315
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,033
Good luck, Chandler.

316
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:50,373
Arrest me, but you'll never
make it stick and you know it.

317
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,941
I have no choice, it's my job.
You understand, right?

318
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,979
And you understand that
I'm calling my lawyer.

319
00:21:57,215 --> 00:22:01,049
And once he puts you on the stand,
he'll make you look like a fool!

320
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,786
I don't like looking foolish.

321
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,417
Maybe I don't arrest you today.
Maybe I came by and you weren't here.

322
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,822
I'd love it if I weren't here!

323
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:16,624
Since you're not going to jail tonight,
I was wondering if you'd...

324
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,063
...Iike to go to dinner with me?

325
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:20,794
Me?

326
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:25,073
Ever since you flashed my badge
I can't stop thinking about you.

327
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,144
You're the prettiest fake
undercover whore I've ever seen.

328
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:31,943
Nice.

329
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:38,189
I didn't see that coming.
You're asking me out.

330
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:41,859
I could've done it better,
but these people keep staring at me.

331
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:46,186
I'd like to go out
with you, officer.

332
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,828
-Gary.
-Gary.

333
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,001
Okay, so it's a date.

334
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,829
I gotta ask you, though.
How'd you find me?

335
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:57,007
I ran your fingerprints
through the computer.

336
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,971
This was listed
as your last known address.

337
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,202
Impressive.

338
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:05,780
Not as impressive as you. Your record
shows you've done some weird stuff.

339
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,610
We'll talk at dinner.

340
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,882
-So I'll come by and pick you up?
-I can't wait.

341
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:16,024
Don't worry, I won't just
take you out for doughnuts.

342
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,729
He has a gun!

343
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:30,301
I'd like to return this couch.
I'm not satisfied with it.

344
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,672
You wanna return this couch?

345
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,982
It's cut in half.

346
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:46,987
-That's what I'm telling you.
-Did you cut this couch in half?

347
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,427
It's crazy, it is cut in half.

348
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,621
I don't understand.

349
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,364
This couch is cut in half.

350
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:02,266
I would like to exchange it for one
that is not cut in half.

351
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:07,010
We can't accept it in this condition.

352
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:11,115
Well, I can't accept it in this condition.

353
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:15,177
You're saying this couch was
delivered to you like this?

354
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,446
Look, I'm a reasonable man.

355
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,247
I will accept store credit.

356
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:25,586
I'll give you store credit
in the amount of four dollars.

357
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,726
I will take it.
