1
00:00:02,848 --> 00:00:06,181
-That girl totally winked at me!
-She did not wink at you.

2
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:08,819
You always think somebody's
winking at you.

3
00:00:25,037 --> 00:00:27,369
The One With the Princess Leia Fantasy

4
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:12,915
l have to say ''Tupelo Honey''
by Van Morrison.

5
00:01:13,085 --> 00:01:14,518
No way!

6
00:01:14,686 --> 00:01:17,678
The most romantic song ever was
''The Way We Were.''

7
00:01:17,856 --> 00:01:22,759
l think the one that Elton John wrote
for that guy on Who's the Boss?

8
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,095
What song was that, Pheebs?

9
00:01:26,832 --> 00:01:30,165
Hold me close
Young Tony Danza

10
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:36,497
-Hi, Monica.
-Hi, Mon.

11
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:38,609
Hey, Mon.

12
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:41,512
Oh, my God!

13
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,545
-Has she slept at all?
-No.

14
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:47,708
-lt's been three nights in a row.
-She finally stopped crying yesterday.

15
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:51,822
But then she found one of Richard's
cigar butts on the terrace....

16
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,619
Okay, that explains it.
l got a call at 2 in the morning...

17
00:01:55,794 --> 00:01:58,922
...and all l could hear was
this squeaky sound. So l thought:

18
00:01:59,097 --> 00:02:00,689
''lt's, like, a mouse or a possum.''

19
00:02:02,534 --> 00:02:04,695
Then l realized, like:

20
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,933
''Okay, where would a mouse or a possum
get the money to make the phone call?''

21
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:14,371
-Morning.
-Morning.

22
00:02:15,414 --> 00:02:16,904
You made pancakes?

23
00:02:17,883 --> 00:02:20,852
Yeah, like there's any way
l could ever do that.

24
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:24,478
Monica and Rachel had syrup

25
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,915
Now I can get my man to cheer up

26
00:02:30,562 --> 00:02:33,360
-Good morning, Joey.
-Good morning.

27
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:36,729
Someone's wearing grumpy pants.

28
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:40,030
lt's gotta be you, man.
l'm wearing smarty-pants.

29
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:43,072
Okay, here we go: One, two...

30
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:48,440
...and here's my chance
to give you a third one.

31
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:51,946
-Joey?
-No, no. l'll just have juice.

32
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:56,985
Why don't you stay home from work today
and just hang out with me?

33
00:02:57,155 --> 00:02:58,247
Oh, l wish.

34
00:02:58,423 --> 00:03:02,189
You have that report to finish,
and l've gotta go see my lawyer.

35
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,090
l can't believe l date
a girl who's getting divorced.

36
00:03:05,263 --> 00:03:07,231
l'm such a grownup.

37
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:08,730
Joey! Hey!

38
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,834
Go to your room!

39
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:12,361
Chandler! Hey!

40
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:14,399
Up yours!

41
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:16,802
l gotta go, l gotta go.

42
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:18,237
Not without a kiss.

43
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,537
Maybe l won't kiss you
so you'll stay.

44
00:03:20,712 --> 00:03:22,907
Kiss her. Kiss her!

45
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:27,283
l'll see you later, sweetie.
Bye, Joey.

46
00:03:27,486 --> 00:03:29,545
Bye-bye, Janice.

47
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:33,281
So when are you dumping her?

48
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,325
Nope. Not this time.

49
00:03:36,495 --> 00:03:38,429
Come on, quit yanking me.

50
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:43,559
l'm not yanking you.

51
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:47,298
-This is Janice.
-Yeah, l know.

52
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:48,939
She makes me happy.

53
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:52,266
Okay. All right.

54
00:03:52,444 --> 00:03:56,005
You look me in the eye and tell me,
without blinking...

55
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:58,911
...that you're not breaking up
with her. No blinking.

56
00:04:01,853 --> 00:04:03,480
l'm not breaking up with her!

57
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:14,826
God, look what l found in the drain!

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,194
What?

59
00:04:17,202 --> 00:04:21,366
lt's some of Richard's hair!
What do l do with this?

60
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:24,769
Getting it away from me
would be job one.

61
00:04:25,677 --> 00:04:28,908
lt's weird, but l don't want
to throw this away.

62
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,173
l mean, this is all l have left of him.

63
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:32,907
Gross...

64
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:34,677
...drain hair.

65
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:46,395
Cool! lt looks like a tiny
little person drowning in your cereal.

66
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:50,664
God, what is wrong with me?

67
00:04:50,836 --> 00:04:54,897
-You need to get some sleep.
-l need to get some Richard.

68
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:59,306
You broke up with him for a reason.

69
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:03,277
l know. l know.
l'm just so tired of missing him.

70
00:05:03,448 --> 00:05:06,713
l'm tired of wondering why he
hasn't called. Why hasn't he called?

71
00:05:06,885 --> 00:05:08,944
Maybe because you told him not to?

72
00:05:09,754 --> 00:05:12,245
What are you, the Memory Woman?

73
00:05:14,025 --> 00:05:16,152
They're not breaking up!
Chandler and Janice?

74
00:05:16,328 --> 00:05:19,991
They're not breaking up!
He didn't blink or anything!

75
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:22,690
l'm not surprised.
Have you seen them together?

76
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:26,326
-They're really cute.
-''Cute''? This is Janice!

77
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,838
You remember Janice?

78
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:31,567
Yes, l remember. She's annoying.
But you know what?

79
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:34,303
She's his girlfriend now.
l mean, what can we do?

80
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,939
There you go! That's the spirit
l'm looking for! ''What can we do?''

81
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:42,720
All right, who's first, huh? Ross?

82
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:45,789
l think Chandler's our friend,
and Janice makes him happy.

83
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:48,482
So l say we all be adult about it
and accept her.

84
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,823
We'll call that ''Plan B,'' all right?

85
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:55,392
Come on, people!
We need some inspiration.

86
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:57,933
Okay, all right.
You want a plan? Here we go:

87
00:05:58,103 --> 00:06:03,040
So, Ross, you go in through the air duct
and disable the alarm, okay?

88
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,540
Then the rest of us
will rappel down ropes.

89
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,044
We're in and out in 1 0 minutes
and disappear into the night. Huh?

90
00:06:31,903 --> 00:06:33,131
Honey...

91
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:35,170
...l was wondering....

92
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,743
Do you still have
that Navy uniform?

93
00:06:41,046 --> 00:06:44,379
No, l had to return it
to the costume place.

94
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:48,007
l think l have an old band uniform
from high school.

95
00:06:48,186 --> 00:06:51,121
You remember not having sex
in high school, right?

96
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:59,591
-Well, honey, what about you?
-What?

97
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:05,528
Do you have any fun, you know,
fantasy-type things?

98
00:07:06,504 --> 00:07:08,165
No.

99
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:11,237
Come on. You gotta have one.

100
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,299
Nope.

101
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:16,073
-Ross. You know what?
-What?

102
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:19,774
lf you tell me, l might do it.

103
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:35,331
Did you ever see Return of the Jedi?

104
00:07:44,342 --> 00:07:47,334
Do you remember the scene...

105
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:51,046
...with Jabba the Hutt?

106
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:57,283
He was this really fat worm guy.

107
00:07:57,722 --> 00:08:00,418
Wow. Men and women
really are different.

108
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:02,550
No. No. No.

109
00:08:02,727 --> 00:08:06,686
See, Jabba had as his prisoner...

110
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:09,129
...Princess Leia.

111
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:15,661
Princess Leia was wearing...

112
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:18,701
...this gold bikini thing.

113
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,138
lt was pretty cool.

114
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:29,310
So are you saying
that you would like me...

115
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:32,520
...to dress up like Princess Leia...

116
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,952
...in a gold bikini?

117
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:35,987
Okay.

118
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:42,089
Princess Leia and the gold bikini?
Every guy our age loved that.

119
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:45,866
Really?

120
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:49,971
lt's huge! That's the moment
when she stopped being a princess...

121
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:52,871
...and she became, like,
you know, a woman.

122
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:59,309
-Did you ever do the Leia thing?
-Oh, yeah.

123
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:05,688
Really? That great, huh?

124
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:10,753
No, it's just that l got this new pager
and l have it on vibrate.

125
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:15,423
See you.

126
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:18,228
-Hey.
-Hi, you guys!

127
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:21,600
Look who l found standing
outside the Szechuan Dragon...

128
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:24,037
...staring at a parking meter.

129
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:32,080
-Why aren't you at work?
-Oh, they sent me home.

130
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,740
Why?

131
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:36,614
Because l don't work
at the Szechuan Dragon.

132
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:40,484
-You really need to get some sleep.
-l know l do.

133
00:09:42,193 --> 00:09:45,219
-Guess what? They published my paper.
-Really?

134
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:47,762
''Statistical Deviations
in the Carbon Dating...

135
00:09:47,932 --> 00:09:52,198
...of Fossilized Algae:
History or Mystery?''

136
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:55,866
Rach, look!

137
00:10:01,446 --> 00:10:05,405
Where is my strong Ross Skywalker
to come rescue me?

138
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:11,511
There he is!

139
00:10:17,162 --> 00:10:18,151
-Wheel!
-Of!

140
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:20,160
Fortune!

141
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:22,494
This guy's so stupid.

142
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,157
lt's Count Rushmore!

143
00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:31,534
You know, you should
really go on this show.

144
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:34,739
Listen, l got three tickets
to the Rangers tonight.

145
00:10:34,913 --> 00:10:38,007
-What do you say?
-l say l am there!

146
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:39,878
Cool!

147
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:42,785
-ls Ross going too?
-No. Janice.

148
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:44,888
Janice?

149
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,221
Because l just feel bad for Ross,
you know?

150
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:54,058
We always go together. We're, like,
the Three Hockey-teers, you know?

151
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:59,127
l may be way out on a limb here,
but do you have a problem with Janice?

152
00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:00,828
No!

153
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:02,733
Yes....

154
00:11:03,508 --> 00:11:06,204
Oh, God, how do l say this?

155
00:11:09,514 --> 00:11:12,677
You know that girl from
the Greek restaurant with the hair?

156
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,944
That girl that l hate?
She drives me crazy.

157
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:21,685
Look, l don't hate Janice.
She's just a lot to take, you know?

158
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:28,698
-Well, there you go.
-Come on, don't look at me like that.

159
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:31,198
She used to drive you nuts
before too, remember?

160
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:34,736
l'm crazy about her now.
l think this could be the real thing.

161
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:36,737
Capital R, capital T!

162
00:11:38,977 --> 00:11:41,775
Don't worry,
those are the right letters.

163
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,543
Look, what do you want me to say?

164
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:48,909
-l want you to say that you like her!
-l can't.

165
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:51,419
-Like her!
-No.

166
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:53,250
So you're not even gonna try?

167
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:56,655
What's the point?
lt's like this chemical thing, you know?

168
00:11:56,828 --> 00:11:59,888
Every time she starts laughing,
l just wanna...

169
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:05,596
...pull my arm off just so l have
something to throw at her.

170
00:12:07,872 --> 00:12:08,964
Thanks for trying.

171
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:14,678
Oh, and by the way,
there is no Count Rushmore!

172
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,080
Yeah? Then who's the guy that
painted the faces on the mountain?

173
00:12:26,357 --> 00:12:28,154
How could you have told her?

174
00:12:28,326 --> 00:12:30,556
l didn't think it would be
that big a deal!

175
00:12:30,728 --> 00:12:33,219
She didn't think it would be
that big a deal!

176
00:12:33,398 --> 00:12:36,128
Who are you talking to
when you do that?

177
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:40,701
Look, that was supposed to be
a private, personal thing between us.

178
00:12:40,872 --> 00:12:45,138
Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay?
We tell each other everything.

179
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,335
l mean, come on!
Guys do the same thing.

180
00:12:47,512 --> 00:12:50,276
What about all that locker-room stuff?

181
00:12:50,448 --> 00:12:53,417
That's different.
That's like, who dated a stripper?

182
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:56,917
Or who did it on the back
of the Staten lsland ferry?

183
00:12:57,855 --> 00:13:00,153
-Both of those Joey?
-Yeah.

184
00:13:00,558 --> 00:13:03,823
But you don't talk
about your girlfriend...

185
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:06,987
...and the intimate stuff
you do with her.

186
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:10,129
-Not even with your best friend?
-No.

187
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:12,394
That is so sad.

188
00:13:12,837 --> 00:13:17,706
You're missing out on so much.
l mean, the bonding and the sharing...

189
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:23,108
...and knowing that someone else is
going through the same thing you are.

190
00:13:23,348 --> 00:13:26,715
So, what, you tell each
other everything?

191
00:13:27,585 --> 00:13:28,711
Pretty much.

192
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:35,124
Did you talk
about the night of five times?

193
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:41,298
Do you tell people
about the night of five times?

194
00:13:41,566 --> 00:13:43,761
Honey, that was with Carol.

195
00:13:43,968 --> 00:13:47,529
l know, but it's still worth
mentioning, l think.

196
00:13:48,873 --> 00:13:52,900
Relax every muscle in your body.

197
00:13:54,145 --> 00:13:58,241
Listen to the plinky-plunky music.

198
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,051
Okay, now close your eyes...

199
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,314
...and think of a happy place.

200
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,151
Tell me your happy place.

201
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:09,788
Richard's living room, drinking wine.

202
00:14:09,961 --> 00:14:15,194
No, no, no. Not a Richard thing.
Just put down the glass and get out.

203
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,300
l'm sorry, but that's my happy place.

204
00:14:18,469 --> 00:14:23,304
Okay, fine. Use my happy place.
Just don't move anything in there.

205
00:14:24,742 --> 00:14:25,902
l'll try not to.

206
00:14:26,077 --> 00:14:30,104
Okay. All right, so,
you're in a meadow...

207
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:33,011
...millions of stars in the sky--

208
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:35,243
You think breaking up was a mistake?

209
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,820
There are no questions
in the happy place.

210
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:41,686
Okay. Just the warm breeze...

211
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:45,420
...and the moonlight flowing
through the trees.

212
00:14:45,596 --> 00:14:47,962
l'll bet he's over me.
l'll bet he's fine.

213
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:53,263
Betting and wagering of any kind
are not permitted in the happy place.

214
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:57,135
There's just, you know,
the lovely waterfalls...

215
00:14:57,308 --> 00:14:59,868
...and the trickling fountains...

216
00:15:00,044 --> 00:15:04,674
...and the calming sounds
of the babbling brook.

217
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:06,942
Okay, this isn't working.

218
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:10,053
l'm still awake,
and now l have to pee.

219
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,051
Guess who!

220
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:26,831
Janice. Hi. You just missed Chandler...

221
00:15:27,004 --> 00:15:29,996
...but won't you come in
before you go?

222
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:34,472
So l hear...

223
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:35,942
...you hate me!

224
00:15:38,216 --> 00:15:41,617
l never said ''hate.''
l was very careful about that.

225
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:47,088
A little birdie told me you wanted
to rip your arm off and throw it at me.

226
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:53,062
And you got ''hate'' from that?
You're taking a big leap there.

227
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:54,823
All right, fine, fine, fine!

228
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:58,833
We have got to do something
about our little situation here.

229
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:00,664
So this is my idea.

230
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:04,706
You and me spending
some quality time together.

231
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,843
-But what does that--?
-For Chandler!

232
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:11,775
Okay. l'm in.

233
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:16,716
Okay! This is what we'll call it:
Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!

234
00:16:18,823 --> 00:16:20,347
Does it have to be a whole day?

235
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:24,825
Yes, because that's how long
it takes to love me.

236
00:16:25,463 --> 00:16:28,921
Yeah, l know.
l sleep in the next room.

237
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:37,374
So do you guys all hate Janice too?

238
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:41,410
You hate Janice now?
Joey's gonna be so relieved.

239
00:16:44,215 --> 00:16:45,409
Oh, my God.

240
00:16:47,985 --> 00:16:50,385
Oh, my God.

241
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:53,919
Well, look, everybody. lt's Weepy:

242
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:57,388
''The Mime that Cares Too Much.''

243
00:16:57,995 --> 00:17:00,259
Then l went down
to the post office...

244
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:03,628
...and it turns out it was those videos
that l ordered for Richard...

245
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:06,065
...about the Civil War.

246
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:08,568
He loved the Civil War.

247
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:13,471
Monica, do you want us
to take you home?

248
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:19,449
Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.

249
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:32,125
Women tell each other everything!
Did you know that?

250
00:17:33,497 --> 00:17:35,931
No, Chandler, everything.

251
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:39,832
Like stuff you like. Stuff she likes.

252
00:17:40,004 --> 00:17:43,235
Technique. Stamina. Girth.

253
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:46,336
Girth?

254
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:48,907
Why? Why? Why? Why?

255
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,877
Why would they do this?

256
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:55,348
Rachel says sharing's great
and supposedly...

257
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,147
...you know, we ought to be doing it.

258
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,453
Do you wanna?

259
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:05,791
We're not gonna talk about girth,
are we?

260
00:18:06,764 --> 00:18:07,992
-Okay.
-Yeah?

261
00:18:08,165 --> 00:18:10,133
All right, you go first.

262
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:13,065
Okay. Okay, l'll go first.

263
00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:15,501
So the other night...

264
00:18:15,673 --> 00:18:19,234
...Rachel and l are in bed
talking about fantasies...

265
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,369
...and l happened
to describe a particular...

266
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:25,348
...Star Wars thing--

267
00:18:25,516 --> 00:18:28,349
-Princess Leia and the gold bikini.
-Yes!

268
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,009
l know!

269
00:18:33,357 --> 00:18:34,881
Well, that was easy.

270
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:37,357
-Okay, you go.
-Okay.

271
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:40,896
You know when you're in bed
with a woman...

272
00:18:44,468 --> 00:18:45,935
...and fooling around...

273
00:18:46,103 --> 00:18:49,095
...and you get all these
mental images in your brain?

274
00:18:49,273 --> 00:18:52,106
Like Elle MacPherson
or the girl at the Xerox place?

275
00:18:52,276 --> 00:18:55,006
-With the bellybutton ring?
-l know.

276
00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:59,247
And then all of a sudden,
your mom pops into your head.

277
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:03,283
And you're like,
''Mom, get out of here!''

278
00:19:03,454 --> 00:19:06,321
But after that,
you can't think of anything else.

279
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:11,757
And you can't stop what you're doing.
So it's kind of like you're...

280
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:13,157
...you know...

281
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,319
...you know....

282
00:19:14,699 --> 00:19:16,496
You don't know!

283
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:19,696
Your mom?

284
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:23,632
You're telling me about your mom?
What is the matter with you?

285
00:19:24,575 --> 00:19:27,567
-You said--
-l said ''share,'' not ''scare'' !

286
00:19:27,878 --> 00:19:29,812
Go sit over there!

287
00:19:35,286 --> 00:19:37,311
We're back!

288
00:19:38,756 --> 00:19:40,621
What are you guys doing together?

289
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:45,091
Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!

290
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:47,928
Really?

291
00:19:48,132 --> 00:19:51,295
We went to a Mets game.
We got Chinese food.

292
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:54,131
And, you know, l love this woman.

293
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:58,001
You have got competition, buddy.

294
00:19:58,943 --> 00:20:02,572
l just came by to give you a kiss.

295
00:20:03,314 --> 00:20:08,411
l have to go pick up the baby.
So l'll see you later, sweetheart.

296
00:20:08,586 --> 00:20:09,814
You too, Chandler.

297
00:20:18,662 --> 00:20:24,259
-You still can't stand her, can you?
-l'm sorry, man. l tried! l really did!

298
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,097
l appreciate you giving it a shot.

299
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:30,734
But, you know, the good thing...

300
00:20:30,908 --> 00:20:34,344
...is that we spent the whole day
together and l survived.

301
00:20:34,512 --> 00:20:37,777
And what's even more amazing,
so did she.

302
00:20:37,948 --> 00:20:39,711
lt was Bat Day at Shea Stadium.

303
00:20:41,986 --> 00:20:45,251
-l guess that's something.
-Oh, man, that's huge!

304
00:20:45,422 --> 00:20:47,720
Now l know l can stand
to be around her.

305
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:50,759
Which means l get
to hang out with you.

306
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:53,624
Which is kind of
the whole point anyway.

307
00:20:58,402 --> 00:21:02,930
Oh, hey! We stopped by
the coffee shop and ran into Ross.

308
00:21:07,678 --> 00:21:09,771
Oh, God.

309
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,574
lf it makes you feel any better,
l do it too.

310
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,487
-Really?
-Oh, yeah!

311
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:21,091
l always picture your mom
when l'm having sex.

312
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:27,493
April 1 2, 1 861.

313
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:34,970
The United States garrison
at Fort Sumter was fired upon.

314
00:21:35,673 --> 00:21:37,903
It is now under bombardment by--

315
00:21:49,153 --> 00:21:50,814
Dad! What are you doing here?

316
00:21:50,988 --> 00:21:55,652
lt's your mother's bridge night, so l
came into the city for a Moni-cuddle.

317
00:21:59,296 --> 00:22:01,764
Since when did you start
smoking cigars?

318
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,793
l don't.
l just like the smell of them.

319
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:10,434
So, what are you really doing here?

320
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:13,543
l just wanted to make sure
that you're okay.

321
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:16,040
Why wouldn't l be okay?

322
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:17,646
l saw Richard.

323
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:22,715
So how you doing?

324
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:24,286
l'm fine.

325
00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:27,891
l'm just a little tired,
but l'm okay.

326
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:30,754
-How's Richard doing?
-You don't wanna know.

327
00:22:30,928 --> 00:22:33,761
No, l really, really do.

328
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:36,229
Well, he's doing terrible!

329
00:22:38,502 --> 00:22:39,969
Really?

330
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:42,937
Worse than when he broke up
with Barbara.

331
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:48,908
-You're not just saying that, are you?
-No, the man is a mess!

332
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,276
-Was he crying?
-No.

333
00:22:52,449 --> 00:22:56,180
Do you think he was waiting till
after you left, so he could cry?

334
00:22:56,353 --> 00:22:57,911
Maybe.

335
00:22:59,456 --> 00:23:01,014
l think so.

336
00:23:01,191 --> 00:23:04,558
Honey, relationships are hard.
Like with your mom and me.

337
00:23:04,728 --> 00:23:08,528
You know, after we graduated
from college, we broke up for a while.

338
00:23:08,699 --> 00:23:11,190
lt seems her father,
your grandfather...

339
00:23:11,368 --> 00:23:14,030
...wanted her to travel
around Europe like he did.

340
00:23:14,204 --> 00:23:17,037
Of course, he got to do it
on Uncle Sam's nickel...

341
