1
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:04,330
Did we get paper towels?

2
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:06,541
You mean the thing
we went to the store for?

3
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,167
Nope.

4
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:11,838
Hey, I got you a present!

5
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:14,424
Oh, my goodness, where did you hide it?

6
00:00:14,632 --> 00:00:18,344
I ordered it for your wedding
and it's finally here!

7
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:21,097
You didn't have to get us anything..

8
00:00:21,347 --> 00:00:24,142
I love it! It's huge! Let's open it!

9
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:30,857
-It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!
-Oh, my God!

10
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:33,151
I didn't know where to put it.

11
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:37,155
-We can put it in the guest bedroom.
-Yeah, okay.

12
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:42,702
I kind of like it here.

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,120
Do you like it?

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,249
I practically spent my
entire childhood at the arcade.

15
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:51,794
-This was my second favorite.
-What's your first?

16
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:55,548
-I don't remember the name.
-Well, what did it do?

17
00:00:55,757 --> 00:01:00,928
You'd put a quarter in,
pull some handles and win a candy bar.

18
00:01:01,137 --> 00:01:03,389
A vending machine?

19
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:07,393
Don't feel bad for me.
I won every time!

20
00:01:44,764 --> 00:01:47,099
I'm so glad you guys are here.

21
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:50,812
Guess what happened
in the paleontology department.

22
00:01:51,062 --> 00:01:54,815
Do you think he saw us,
or can we still slip out?

23
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:59,195
Professor Newman, the department head,
is retiring, so..

24
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:04,492
-They made you head of the department!
-I'm teaching his advanced class!

25
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:08,120
Why didn't I get head
of the department?

26
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:10,790
Great. You've always wanted
to teach an advanced class.

27
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:15,169
No, I know. It's really exciting.
This is the break I've been waiting for.

28
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:17,755
I'm not sure a court-ordered
detox program..

29
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:20,842
was the break
Professor Newman was waiting for.

30
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,009
But, hey.

31
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:28,015
Hey, Rach, I got a big date.
Do you know a good restaurant?

32
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:33,354
Paul's Cafe. It's got great food
and it's really romantic.

33
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:34,856
Great, thanks.

34
00:02:35,064 --> 00:02:38,568
Then take her to the
Four Seasons for drinks.

35
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:42,530
Or go downtown
and listen to some jazz.

36
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:45,324
Or dancing. Oh, take her dancing!

37
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:49,120
You sure are naming
a lot of ways to postpone sex.

38
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:54,375
I miss dating. Dressing up,
going to a fancy restaurant.

39
00:02:55,084 --> 00:02:59,505
I won't be able to do that for so long.
And it's so much fun.

40
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:04,385
Not that sitting around
worrying about giving birth isn't fun.

41
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:09,557
Hey, you know what?
Why don't I take you out.

42
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:12,810
You don't want to date
a pregnant lady.

43
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,813
Yes, I do. We're gonna
have a good time.

44
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:20,526
I'll take your mind off of childbirth,
and C-sections..

45
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:23,029
and baby heads stretching out..

46
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:24,864
Okay, I'll go with you.

47
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,533
-It will be fun.
-All right.

48
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,619
No, no! Yes!

49
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:32,622
Would you look at that.

50
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:36,125
I knocked off all your top scores.
How sad.

51
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:37,627
Okay, I'm next.

52
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:41,172
Don't start another game.
I'm next! Phoebe?

53
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:45,384
Sorry, I couldn't hear you
over all the winning.

54
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:49,263
-Phoebe's hogging the game.
-It's a stupid game.

55
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:52,433
You think it's stupid because
you suck.

56
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,561
I don't suck. It sucks.

57
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:58,064
You suck.

58
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:04,362
If this game is gonna cause problems,
I should keep it.

59
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,448
No, I love it. It is a great present.

60
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:11,744
Why don't you go home and wait
for the thank-you card?

61
00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:17,249
-Why do you want to play this game?
-It doesn't spit out a Clark Bar.

62
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:21,128
Okay. Phoebe, that's it.
Out of the chair.

63
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:24,924
Phoebe!
Chandler!

64
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:29,011
No, no. This is a girl fight.
I'm hoping it will turn into love-play.

65
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:34,058
Okay, look.
Honey, I'm sorry..

66
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:38,104
I'm acting hostile. I don't mean to.
It's just that I love this game so much..

67
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,815
that I would just like
the chance to play it too.

68
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:44,318
Wow, it's amazing how well I can play
with you yapping around my head..

69
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:45,486
like a Chihuahua.

70
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:50,324
All right, that's it. Chandler,
help me get her out of the chair.

71
00:04:51,117 --> 00:04:53,285
Chandler, come on.

72
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:06,173
Joey, could you get that?

73
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:10,803
Joey.

74
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:21,230
I thought you were in your room.

75
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,859
I'm picking you up for our date.
For you.

76
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,947
Lilies. They're my favorite.
Thank you.

77
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:33,200
And a brownie.

78
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,662
Well, half a brownie.

79
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:38,998
Actually, it's just a bag.

80
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:44,003
It's a long walk from the flower shop
and I felt faint, so..

81
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:49,216
This is so great! I actually feel
like I'm on a real date.

82
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:54,680
But I have morning sickness and
I have on underwear that goes up to..

83
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:56,348
there.

84
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,351
Hey, come on. This is a real date.

85
00:05:59,602 --> 00:06:02,062
So nice place you got here.

86
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:06,358
Football. Pizza box.

87
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:10,571
Oh, a subscription to Playboy.
My kind of woman.

88
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,740
That's my roommate's.

89
00:06:12,948 --> 00:06:16,744
I'd like to meet him.
He sounds like a standup guy.

90
00:06:16,952 --> 00:06:21,123
He's protective of me,
so you'd better watch yourself.

91
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:24,210
Your roommate, is he good-looking?

92
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:29,465
Must be tough to keep your hands
off him.

93
00:06:29,965 --> 00:06:31,842
I'm pretty sure he's gay.

94
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,014
No! No, he's not! Why are you trying
to ruin the game?

95
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:42,561
Which brings us back
to Greely's Theory of Dominance.

96
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:44,730
That's it for today.

97
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:48,400
Does anyone know where
the Freeman Building is?

98
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,903
It's the new building on Avenue A.

99
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:55,157
That's across town.
I'm teaching there in 10 minutes.

100
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:57,535
Dude, that's not gonna happen.

101
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:02,414
Move it! Move it!

102
00:07:02,665 --> 00:07:05,126
Hey! I'm the teacher!

103
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:20,432
Hello.

104
00:07:24,353 --> 00:07:28,816
Sorry I'm a little late.
Whoa, a lot late.

105
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:32,778
Well, let me start
by introducing myself.

106
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:35,364
I'm Professor Geller.

107
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:38,826
So to sum up..

108
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:43,038
I'm Professor Geller.
Good job today.

109
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:49,670
-What comes with the filet mignon?
-Steamed vegetables.

110
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:54,800
Instead of the vegetables..

111
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:59,305
is there any way that I could
substitute the..

112
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,640
three-pound lobster?

113
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:05,436
You know what? Bring her both.

114
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:08,022
And I'll have the same.

115
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:12,276
Wow, this is shaping up
to be a pretty good date.

116
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:15,529
I almost forgot.
I didn't pay you the rent.

117
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:17,990
No roommate stuff. It's a date.

118
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,828
Wow, so I get to see what
Joey Tribbiani is like on a date.

119
00:08:23,078 --> 00:08:24,330
Have any moves?

120
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,959
No, I'm just myself,
and if they don't like me for..

121
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,506
I'm sorry, I couldn't even
get through that.

122
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,927
I knew it. Tell me your moves.

123
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:39,720
All right.

124
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,180
Well..

125
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:46,227
I start by having a bottle of wine
sent to my table from a fan.

126
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:49,897
Oh, my God. And that works?

127
00:08:50,105 --> 00:08:55,444
If you add, "This is embarrassing.
I just want to have a normal life."

128
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:58,155
You poor little famous man.

129
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:00,991
Okay, how about this one?

130
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:04,912
I was gonna wait until the end
of the night to kiss you..

131
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,707
but you're just so beautiful,
I don't think I can.

132
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:12,086
Oh, my God!

133
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:18,384
Wow, that was fantastic!
I almost leaned in. Really.

134
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,719
So tell me one of your moves.

135
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,930
All right.

136
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:28,310
So where'd you grow up?

137
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:30,729
That's your move?

138
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,816
Boy, Rach, you're lucky you're hot.

139
00:09:34,024 --> 00:09:37,987
-Come on, just answer the question.
-Queens.

140
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,572
Were you close to your parents?

141
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:44,034
-With my mom. Not so much my dad.
-Why not?

142
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:47,288
I don't know.
There's just this distance.

143
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:51,083
We both try to pretend it's not there,
but it is.

144
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,253
It's gotta be rough.

145
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:58,465
Yeah, it's really tough.
Sometimes I think..

146
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:00,509
Wow!

147
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:05,764
Nice move!

148
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:09,601
-"Where'd you grow up?" So simple.
-Thank you.

149
00:10:09,852 --> 00:10:12,855
Now, excuse me.
I'm gonna use the restroom.

150
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:20,029
-Now you're watching me walk away.
-Yes, I am! So simple!

151
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:29,121
-You won't believe what I did today.
-Clearly not shower or shave.

152
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,666
I played this all day,
and now I rule.

153
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,295
They should change the name
to "Ms. Chandler."

154
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:40,382
Although, I hope they don't.

155
00:10:40,632 --> 00:10:45,929
You stayed home and played Ms. Pac-Man
while I went to work like a chump?

156
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,018
I got the top 10 scores. I erased
Phoebe off the board. High-five!

157
00:10:52,436 --> 00:10:55,397
What is the matter with your hand?

158
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:00,319
I played for eight hours.

159
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:03,447
It'll loosen up. Check out the scores.

160
00:11:03,655 --> 00:11:07,034
Also, look at the initials.
They're dirty words.

161
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:11,497
-Chandler, why would you do that?
-Because it's awesome.

162
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,290
You think it's clever?

163
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:18,670
They only give you three letters,
so after A-S-S, it is a challenge.

164
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:20,839
But clearly you're up to the task.

165
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:26,220
-This one's not dirty.
-Put it together with that one.

166
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:27,679
Oh.

167
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:32,851
If you don't clear this off,
you won't get one of those from me.

168
00:11:33,394 --> 00:11:36,146
Ben's coming over tomorrow.
This can't be there.

169
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:40,234
-He won't know what they mean.
-He's 7, not stupid.

170
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:44,738
-Have you talked to him lately?
-I'm gonna unplug it.

171
00:11:44,988 --> 00:11:48,700
I'll have nothing to show for my day.
Like work.

172
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:50,661
No!

173
00:11:51,703 --> 00:11:53,747
Hey, look! It's still there!

174
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:57,751
This thing must have some kind
of primitive ROM chip!

175
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,588
Wow. The dirty words
and the computer talk.

176
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,632
This is just the coolest
you've ever been.

177
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:08,220
-You gotta beat your scores.
-With the claw?

178
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:11,890
Fine, I'll do it.
We gotta get this off.

179
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:16,061
Carol's still upset that
you taught him "Pull my finger."

180
00:12:16,353 --> 00:12:20,023
Pull my finger. My hand is messed up!

181
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:28,157
-I am not gonna answer that.
-Oh, come on. Just pick one.

182
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:31,910
Between Monica, Phoebe,
Chandler and Ross..

183
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,663
if you had to,
who would you punch?

184
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:38,500
We're friends.
I wouldn't punch any of them.

185
00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:40,669
Chandler?

186
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,672
Yeah, but I don't know why.

187
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:48,010
-I'm having a wonderful time!
-Me too!

188
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,097
-This is the best date I ever had.
-I know!

189
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:55,934
I laughed so hard. Did you
see the wine come out my nose?

190
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:58,812
Joey, I think everybody saw it.

191
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:04,610
I never knew I could enjoy
the non-sex part of a date so much.

192
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:09,656
That's because you have never
been on a date with me before.

193
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:13,118
All right. Now don't judge me.

194
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:17,956
I normally wait till my date leaves,
but I'm ripping into the swan.

195
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,918
Okay, then you don't judge me.

196
00:13:21,126 --> 00:13:24,630
I'm gonna suck on the cellophane
from that brownie.

197
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:35,515
Oh, yeah.

198
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:40,437
So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's
end-of-the-night moves?

199
00:13:42,814 --> 00:13:46,610
Well, if I want the girl to kiss me..

200
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,239
first, I make my lips
look irresistible.

201
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:51,698
How do you do it?

202
00:13:52,074 --> 00:13:55,827
Now you can't tell anyone, but..

203
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:59,539
I put on shiny lip balm.

204
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:05,295
-Oh, my God.
-Like a moth to a flame, I tell you.

205
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:09,216
-Okay, now you go.
-No, I don't want to tell you.

206
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:11,301
-Why not?
-It's embarrassing.

207
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:15,305
More embarrassing than
shiny raspberry lip balm?

208
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:19,017
I didn't say raspberry before, did I?

209
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,729
Just tell me, Rach. Just tell me.

210
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,106
Okay.

211
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:26,358
All right, stand up.

212
00:14:28,777 --> 00:14:31,113
Well, when we're at the door..

213
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:36,201
I lightly press my lips
against his.

214
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,622
Then move into his body,
just for a second.

215
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:43,333
And then I make this sound:

216
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:52,050
It doesn't sound like anything,
but it works.

217
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:55,512
Oh, yeah. That would work, yeah.

218
00:14:56,638 --> 00:15:01,226
All right, I gotta go to bed.
I had such a wonderful time.

219
00:15:07,316 --> 00:15:09,318
Me too.

220
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:24,166
You were 50 minutes late?
Did you crawl?

221
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,210
No, I ran, okay? It's really far.

222
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:31,673
When did people stop understanding
"Get out of my way"?

223
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:34,259
Why didn't you take a cab?

224
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:39,389
With the traffic and one-way streets,
it'd take me twice as long.

225
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,394
And I have class three times a week.
Who am I, Rockefeller?

226
00:15:45,187 --> 00:15:47,606
You won't be able to keep doing this.

227
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:51,526
If I don't, they'll take the class
away from me.

228
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:54,780
And I put it in my family newsletter.

229
00:15:55,739 --> 00:15:59,326
-Your what?
-You've seen it, The Geller Yeller.

230
00:16:00,786 --> 00:16:03,830
Right. Wow.

231
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:09,211
I figured out a faster route.
I'm sure I can make it this time.

232
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:14,633
I just can't be afraid
to get a little bit hit by cars.

233
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:18,512
-Hey.
-Hi!

234
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:21,807
Remember when we talked about Cujo?

235
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,310
I can't believe you haven't seen Cujo.

236
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,521
Relax, it isn't Citizen Kane.

237
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:30,899
Have you ever sat through
Citizen Kane?

238
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:35,195
Yeah, it's really boring.
But it's, like, a big deal.

239
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:38,782
Anyway, I was thinking
about renting Cujo.

240
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:41,410
Well, let's do it tonight.

241
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:45,205
-Don't you have that big date?
-Oh, right.

242
00:16:45,414 --> 00:16:48,834
-Hey, Joey, can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

243
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:51,920
After our date, did you feel weird?

244
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:56,842
Oh, my God. You did too?
It freaked me out. What was that?

245
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:02,556
I don't know. I'm kind of thinking
it was the lobster.

246
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,603
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the lobster.

247
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:12,190
-I was up sick all night.
-Me too. All night.

248
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:15,110
Really? We didn't cross paths.

249
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:18,238
Yeah, well, that's because..

250
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:20,949
I stayed in my room.

251
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:24,578
You don't want to look
in my hamper.

252
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:30,834
Okay, I got that.

253
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:34,087
I'll escape there.
I'll come back here.

254
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:37,007
All right. Come on, Ms. Pac-Man.

255
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:42,345
Well, you're just a little bitch,
aren't you?!

256
00:17:44,473 --> 00:17:46,516
Hey, you guys?

257
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:50,228
I'm sorry that I was
hogging the game before.

258
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,565
But if you don't get off soon,
I will cut you.

259
00:17:55,776 --> 00:18:01,823
Oh, my God! Your friends have
some unfortunate initials.

260
00:18:02,032 --> 00:18:03,492
They're all Chandler.

261
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:06,036
Chandler couldn't get this good.

262
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:11,082
I did. But it came at a price.

263
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,419
Ben's coming, and he can't see this.

264
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:18,089
By age 7, kids have
already seen orgies.

265
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,762
Was it just me?

266
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:28,850
So..

267
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:30,560
we're about out of time.

268
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:35,190
Now, I know I've given
you a lot of new information.

269
00:18:36,858 --> 00:18:39,110
And it may seem
a little overwhelming.

270
00:18:42,113 --> 00:18:44,157
But, if there's one thing..

271
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,618
you need to take away
from class today..

272
00:18:49,204 --> 00:18:50,455
it's that..

273
00:18:50,622 --> 00:18:54,000
dinosaurs ain't never coming back.

274
00:18:54,584 --> 00:18:57,045
I'll see you next time.

275
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:13,812
Yes, I made it! I'm on time!

276
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:21,528
Okay, why don't we all..

277
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,324
open our books to page 23..

278
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:28,034
where..

279
00:19:29,452 --> 00:19:32,372
where you will see..

280
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:38,336
a bunch of red spots.

281
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:44,759
Okay, why don't you all start to read
while I..

282
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:53,560
This is so embarrassing.

283
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,771
I just want to have a normal life.

284
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,858
Wow, that's an expensive
bottle of wine.

285
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,985
It is?

286
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:04,487
That's funny, my fans
don't normally do that.

287
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:16,458
Are you all right?
You seem a little distracted.

288
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:20,128
No, no, I'm fine. It's just..

289
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:23,423
Hey, can I ask you something?

290
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:26,509
Have you ever looked at someone
you know..

291
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,305
and suddenly seen them
in a different way?

292
00:20:30,513 --> 00:20:32,557
You mean like from behind?

293
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:40,482
Yeah. That's exactly it.

294
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:44,986
I saw this guy from behind,
and he seemed totally normal.

295
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:48,949
And then he turned around
and it was Stephen Baldwin!

296
00:20:50,075 --> 00:20:51,409
Yeah.

297
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:54,079
So you know exactly what I mean.

298
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:57,582
Totally! Wow.

299
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,628
-Would you excuse me?
-Sure.

300
00:21:13,765 --> 00:21:16,226
-Phoebe! You're on fire!
-I know!

301
00:21:16,518 --> 00:21:17,769
You can do it!

302
00:21:17,978 --> 00:21:19,979
-Don't touch me!
-Don't touch her!

303
00:21:20,188 --> 00:21:22,482
Go left! Go right! Go right!

304
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:24,359
I can't! I can't!

305
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:27,779
No! You son of a..

306
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:42,585
Phoebe?!

307
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:46,840
Oh, hi, Ben.
No, don't look at the machine!

308
00:21:56,099 --> 00:21:59,769
Thank God you're home!
I'm watching Cujo.

309
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,607
-Alone?
-Yes! What is wrong with this dog?

310
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:08,945
Did you get to the part where Cujo
throws himself at the car?

311
00:22:09,154 --> 00:22:13,074
No, seriously,
what's wrong with the dog?

312
00:22:13,408 --> 00:22:15,785
Wait, what happened to your date?

313
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,371
Oh, it didn't work out.

314
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,293
-Want to watch the rest of the movie?
-Oh, okay. Yeah.

315
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:25,879
I never thought I'd say this..

316
00:22:26,129 --> 00:22:28,381
but I hope this dog dies.

317
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,553
What are you doing?
Sit here. Protect me.

318
00:22:33,762 --> 00:22:36,973
Oh. Sure, yeah. Why not?

319
00:22:41,102 --> 00:22:42,562
Okay.

320
00:22:47,358 --> 00:22:51,196
-That's him, that's him! That's Cujo!
-I know.

321
00:22:52,322 --> 00:22:54,824
It's gonna be okay.

322
00:22:55,075 --> 00:23:00,371
Oh, my God. What's he gonna do now?
I can't watch.

323
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:05,668
How can you watch this?
Aren't you scared?

324
00:23:09,506 --> 00:23:11,549
Terrified.

325
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:26,439
So is everybody here?
I got here a little early, myself.

326
00:23:26,731 --> 00:23:27,732
Let us begin.

327
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:34,114
Now, the hadrosaurids have been
unearthed in two main locations.

328
00:23:36,366 --> 00:23:37,992
Here..

329
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:40,078
and..

330
00:23:40,954 --> 00:23:42,080
here.

331
00:23:42,956 --> 00:23:45,750
Now, as for the hydrosaurs..
