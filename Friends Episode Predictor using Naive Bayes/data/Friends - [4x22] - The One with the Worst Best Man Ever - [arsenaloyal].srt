1
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:09,099
That was the 10th time
I've peed here.

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,376
It's also the 10th time
you've told us.

3
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,671
Sorry, it must be hard to hear.

4
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:19,885
It's easier having babies playing
"Bring in Da Funk" on your bladder!

5
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:25,252
I am so sick of being pregnant. God!

6
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:29,259
I can't sleep, except on my back,
which hurt. So I can't sleep.

7
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,164
My only happiness
is from a cup of coffee...

8
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,028
...which is decaf
because I'm pregnant!

9
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,331
You want a cookie?

10
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,810
Thank you so much!

11
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:50,046
So, honey, how are those
mood swings coming?

12
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,778
I haven't had any yet.

13
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:57,081
The One with the
Worst Best Man Ever

14
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:43,995
Hey, guys.

15
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,264
All right, here's the ring.

16
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,466
Yes, yes!
A thousand times, yes!

17
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,377
Any ideas for the bachelor party?

18
00:01:55,915 --> 00:02:00,477
Before rings and bachelor parties, you have
to decide who your best man will be.

19
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,280
Oh, it's awkward.

20
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,653
I already asked Chandler.

21
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,187
He got to do it
at your first wedding.

22
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,560
I figured you'd understand.
I've known him longer.

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,759
I don't have any brothers.
I'll never be a best man.

24
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,733
You can be the best man
when I get married.

25
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,738
I'll never get to be a best man!

26
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,271
Wait, wait.

27
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,438
So you'll be my best man twice,
and I won't be yours at all?

28
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:35,076
Of course, you can be my best man.

29
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,820
-What about me? You said I could.
-I'm not getting married!

30
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,156
It's a question
for science-fiction writers.

31
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,161
I can't believe it's not me.

32
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,936
-How could it not be me?
-I'm not even

33
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,337
You know what?
That's it.

34
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,302
From now on,
Joey will be my best man.

35
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,602
Shame about you, though.

36
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,815
-Stop it.
-What?

37
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,016
One of the babies is kicking.

38
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,614
That's a good thing.

39
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:14,259
It's not kicking me.
It's kicking another baby.

40
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,363
Don't make me come in there!

41
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,658
Do you have a big bowl
I can borrow?

42
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,666
There's one under the cabinet.

43
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,706
-Why do you need it?
-We're having a party tomorrow night.

44
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:33,902
-Are you planning on inviting us?
-No. Later!

45
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,181
Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!

46
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,147
Hormones.

47
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,847
How come you're having a party
and we're not invited?

48
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,186
-It's Ross' bachelor party.
-So?

49
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,455
Are you bachelors?

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,461
Are you strippers?

51
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,632
Then you're not invited.

52
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:03,173
Then you're not invited
to our party either.

53
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,934
What party?

54
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,572
Phoebe's baby shower.

55
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:16,048
Baby shower? That so doesn't sound
like something I want to do.

56
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,322
I can't believe
I'm going to have a party.

57
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,018
That's so great.
A party!

58
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,233
I don't know why.

59
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,574
This is what I got going
for the party liquor-wise.

60
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,302
-Get a lot of liquor.
-Great.

61
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:45,483
In terms of the invite list,
I got you, me and Chandler.

62
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:49,051
I'll invite Gunther because
we're talking pretty loud.

63
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,949
I'll be there.

64
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,759
I know it's your party...

65
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,327
...but I'd like to limit
the number of museum geeks.

66
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:02,591
Let's not invite any anthropologists.
Just the dinosaur dudes.

67
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,668
We'll need a six-pack of Zima.

68
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,940
Hey, what are you doing?

69
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:16,241
Just planning my bachelor party
with my best man.

70
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,748
Good luck trying
to top the last one.

71
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:22,784
It won't be that difficult
since this one won't be...

72
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,082
...in the basement of a Pizza Hut.

73
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,925
I'm Ross, I'm Ross.
I'm too good for the Hut.

74
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,995
I gotta go pick up Ben.
Everything sounds great.

75
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,398
Keep it on the mellow side.
A few guys hanging out.

76
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,539
-No strippers or anything.
-You got it.

77
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,300
See you later.

78
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,772
Have fun planning your mellow party.

79
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:54,113
There will be strippers. He didn't
say anything about no strippers.

80
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,980
He just said, "No strippers."

81
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,780
I chose not to hear that.

82
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,389
Look what I got, look what I got!

83
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,736
They make these for little people!

84
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,999
Little Village People.

85
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,301
Look at this one.
This is my favorite.

86
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,006
That is so sweet.

87
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,307
Phoebe will love dressing them.

88
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,818
Except she won't be the one
who gets to dress them.

89
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,959
She won't get to keep the babies.

90
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:40,359
My God, we are throwing
the most depressing baby shower!

91
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:46,466
Unless we give her all gifts
she can use after her pregnancy.

92
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,004
Like regular coffee. Tequila!

93
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,837
-A carton of cigarettes!
-She doesn't smoke.

94
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:55,378
-It's the thought that counts.
-It's a great idea.

95
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,608
And those leather pants
she's always wanted!

96
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,275
She'll love that!

97
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,077
What the hell is this?

98
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,985
You thought it'd make me feel better?

99
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,717
To give me something
I can't use for two months?

100
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,419
This sucks!

101
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,658
-Who gave me this?
-Well, l

102
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,031
They told me you like them.

103
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:25,875
All right, then I'm wrong. It's a great gift.
The best present I ever got!

104
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,871
What's my next present?

105
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,241
We don't have anything.

106
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,377
All right, fine, then this is over.

107
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,285
Balloons!

108
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,790
-Listen, about the stripper....
-Yeah?

109
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,988
Good call!

110
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,168
So I'll be hosting
your next bachelor party?

111
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:53,794
Joey, I'm kind of hoping
this will be my last one.

112
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,835
A little announcement.

113
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,674
I've decided that my best man
is my best friend Gunther.

114
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,108
What's my last name?

115
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,011
Central Perk?

116
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,489
Thanks for not marrying Rachel.

117
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,592
Hey, Gunther!
Don't forget your shirt.

118
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,920
What are those?

119
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,827
Little party favors.
Check it out.

120
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:34,309
Just want everybody to know the
position of my best man is still open.

121
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,677
So is the position of the bride.

122
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,443
Great.

123
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,142
Smooth, man.

124
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,812
You got some chili on your neck.

125
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:51,725
I just want to say thanks, everyone.
This was great!

126
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,296
See you guys Monday morning.

127
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,234
-Thanks, Joey.
-Don't forget your shirt.

128
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,909
Hey, museum geeks!
Party's over.

129
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,410
Wave bye-bye to the nice lady.
There you go.

130
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:14,050
Back to your parents' basement.
All right.

131
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,623
Boys, come on out.
Here you go.

132
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,889
Look at the birdies!
Are those yours?

133
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:28,325
They let you keep
chickens and ducks as pets?

134
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:31,196
And I got the duck
totally trained too.

135
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,763
Stare at the wall.

136
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,666
Hardly move.

137
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,677
Be white.

138
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,245
You are good at that.

139
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,547
I had fun tonight.

140
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:49,779
-You throw one hell of a party.
-Thanks. It was great meeting you.

141
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:54,857
If any of my friends ever get married
or have a birthday or a Tuesday....

142
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,291
Yeah, that'd be great.

143
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,924
So, I guess, good night.

144
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,636
Unless you want to hang around.

145
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,807
I'll let you play with my duck.

146
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,989
Stripper!

147
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,832
The stripper stole the ring!

148
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,738
Chandler, get up!
The stripper stole the ring!

149
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,537
-What?
-The ring is gone!

150
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,846
Just give me a minute
to wake up for this.

151
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,518
You lost the ring.
You're the worst best man!

152
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,958
This isn't funny.
I go to sleep, everything's cool.

153
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,188
I wake up, the stripper's gone,
and the ring is gone!

154
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,330
-You slept with her?
-Of course!

155
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,205
-Hi, guys.
-Hi, Phoebe.

156
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:21,170
I wanted to apologize if I seemed
a tad edgy yesterday at my shower.

157
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,173
Just the hormones.

158
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,747
-No, we
-Hormones.

159
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:30,012
I wanted to say thank you.
It was so sweet.

160
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,626
You seem to be doing much better.

161
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,026
-How are things going?
-Good.

162
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:46,261
Everything's been about me lately.
So what's happening with you?

163
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:51,033
We were just talking about me
not going to Ross' wedding.

164
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:56,046
It just might be too hard,
given the history and all that.

165
00:11:56,282 --> 00:12:00,218
This reminds me of the time
when I lived on the street.

166
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,683
This guy offered to buy me food
if I slept with him.

167
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,618
How is this like that?

168
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:12,797
Well, let's see.
It's not really like that.

169
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,500
Because that was an actual problem.

170
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,227
And yours is just a bunch
of high-school crap...

171
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,134
...that nobody really gives!

172
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,404
I'm sorry. I just thought

173
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,150
Here come the water works.

174
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:37,948
I called the company that sent her,
and they don't care.

175
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:42,354
I called 911 and they yelled at me.
This is an emergency!

176
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,954
I really wanna help you out,
but I got plans to go see Titanic...

177
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:50,068
...so I've got to call 911
to find out what time it starts.

178
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,929
Hey, guys.

179
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,603
Thanks again for last night.
What a great party.

180
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,540
The guys from work had a blast.

181
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:03,771
One of them had never been
to a bachelor party before.

182
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:07,077
Another one had never been
to a party before.

183
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,254
So that wedding ring.

184
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,656
-Man, that is nice.
-Yeah, right?

185
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,626
I might pick one of those
babies up for myself.

186
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,562
Where might one get one of those?

187
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,729
When my grandmother first came
to this country...

188
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:30,806
...that ring and the clothes on her back
were all she had with her.

189
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:37,142
So you might say
that the ring is irreplaceable.

190
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:41,148
Absolutely. It's been in my family
for generations.

191
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,151
Every bride who's worn it
has lived a long and happy life.

192
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,451
So you might say it's a magic ring.

193
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,565
Yeah, the stripper stole it.

194
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,993
What?

195
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,763
-What did you just
-I think I heard what he said.

196
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:08,107
I believe it was,
"The stripper stole the ring."

197
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,043
My ring? My wedding ring?

198
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:16,311
The stripper stole my wedding ring?

199
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,581
How could this happen?

200
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:22,887
It all started when you said,
"Joey, you be my best man!"

201
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,993
All right.
I'm going to call the cops.

202
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,566
I screwed up.
But you don't have to turn me in.

203
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:35,740
-Not on you, on the stripper.
-I already did that.

204
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:40,001
They said they'd look into it
after they solve all the murders.

205
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,771
-We'll call the company that sent her.
-I did that too.

206
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,745
They wouldn't give me her real name.

207
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,113
They said if I bother them again,
they'd call the police.

208
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:52,417
I said, "You talk to the police,
you tell them I'm missing a ring."

209
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,455
So, what are you telling me?

210
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,219
There's nothing we can do?

211
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:01,264
-How could this happen?
-Look, Ross, I am so sorry.

212
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,595
What if we just called her...

213
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,798
...used a fake name
and had her come to my office?

214
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,512
That sounds like fun,
but we got a ring to find!

215
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,279
Here's your tea, Phoebe.

216
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,318
It's so good.

217
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,661
Thanks.

218
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,767
-Good.
-So glad you like it.

219
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,566
What? She made the tea.

220
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,776
I think I just had a contraction.

221
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,933
-What?
-My God!

222
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,339
I felt one a few minutes ago.

223
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,478
That definitely was one.

224
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,344
You can't have the baby here.

225
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,146
I haven't sterilized the apartment
since the guys moved out!

226
00:15:55,321 --> 00:16:01,317
It's okay. I'll boil some water
and rip up some sheets.

227
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,557
It's probably false labor.

228
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:08,096
That can happen near the end.
Just get the book.

229
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,132
-Get the book!
-The book!

230
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,700
-The Bible?
-I don't know!

231
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,944
All right. This is great.

232
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,876
You get behind the desk.

233
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:28,383
When she comes in,
she won't recognize you because

234
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,418
Well, why would she?

235
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,281
And then you buzz Ross and l.

236
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:37,518
You be Mr. Gonzales,
and I'll be Mr. Wong.

237
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,364
Diverse.

238
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,831
Anybody call for security?

239
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,033
You be cool.

240
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,844
Which one is Gunther Central Perk?

241
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,776
Joey.

242
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:03,318
Where's my ring?
My dead grandmother's wedding ring.

243
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,718
Way to be cool, man.

244
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:09,518
What?

245
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,561
There was a ring in a box.
After you left, it was gone.

246
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,791
You think I stole some ring?

247
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,732
We know you took it!
Just save yourself the time and confess.

248
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,842
Who are you, the Hardy Boys?

249
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:33,183
I don't need to steal a stupid ring.
I make $1,600 a week.

250
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,410
Any of you guys make that?

251
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,183
Marry me.

252
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,294
I don't get it. It was in my room all night.
She didn't take it.

253
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,591
I didn't take it.
You didn't take it. Then who did?

254
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,195
We're trying to think.

255
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,720
I don't get how you know
it's false labor.

256
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,445
Do you see any babies?

257
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,858
-How do you feel?
-Okay, I guess.

258
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,290
I don't know.

259
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,728
I know it's going
to be over soon so....

260
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,526
But isn't that a good thing?

261
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:29,399
-You said you were sick of this.
-I know.

262
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,405
Usually, when you're done
with the pregnant thing...

263
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,908
...you get to do the mom thing.

264
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:41,751
But I'll be sitting around in my
leather pants, drinking tequila.

265
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,086
Some moms do that.

266
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,354
That's even sadder.

267
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:53,696
Look, I know what I got myself into.

268
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:58,325
It's just that
now that they're in me...

269
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:02,505
...it's like I know them and....

270
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:07,208
It just won't be easy
when these babies have to go away.

271
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,947
I know, sweetie.

272
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,683
But it's not like
you won't have anything.

273
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:16,252
You'll have nieces and nephews.
That's even better.

274
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,250
-Yeah, okay.
-No, really.

275
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:24,259
You won't be the one
worrying about saving for college.

276
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,862
Or yelling at them when they're bad.

277
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,967
Or putting them on Ritalin
when they just won't calm down.

278
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:38,041
You'll be the one they run away to.
The one they talk to about sex.

279
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,437
You just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe.

280
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,746
Cool Aunt Phoebe.

281
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,609
I am pretty cool.

282
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:52,957
And you know what else?
Are they going to love you!

283
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,984
They are going to love me.

284
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,627
Thanks, you guys. Again.

285
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,056
Oh, sweetie.

286
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,325
Thanks.

287
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,493
What?

288
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:07,696
Just kidding.

289
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,499
Oh, my God!

290
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,538
Got you again.
You're so easy!

291
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,340
If anything happens to him

292
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,519
The vet said
it's a simple procedure.

293
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,780
Things can go wrong.
What if he doesn't make it?

294
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,220
-He will, Joe.
-But what if he doesn't?

295
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,294
He's such a good duck.

296
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,664
I'm so worried about him!

297
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,862
Somebody lose a ring?

298
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,608
Oh, my God!
Thank you! Thank you so much!

299
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,670
How's the duck?

300
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,850
Just fine.
You'll see him in a bit.

301
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,843
Great.

302
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:31,284
-Thanks for being so cool.
-No, that's all right.

303
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:36,118
You made me your best man
and I totally let you down.

304
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,454
-It's not your fault.
-Yeah, it is.

305
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,459
You wouldn't have lost it.

306
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:45,101
Ross, you were right.
He should be your best man.

307
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,204
-No, you should.
-Don't argue.

308
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,302
I get to choose my best man.

309
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,908
I want both you guys.

310
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,277
Really?

311
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,985
Both you guys should be
up there with me.

312
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,651
You two are my

313
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,623
I'm lucky to have just one good

314
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,325
Thanks, man.

315
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:15,998
I got to go check something, okay?

316
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:23,130
-What a baby!
-Total wuss.

317
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:35,346
-How come you're getting Nana's ring?
-Mom gave it to me.

318
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,978
She said something about it being
a wedding ring and that you may not need...

319
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,715
...one.

320
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,254
I really didn't need to tell you all that.

321
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,557
I don't really think it's fair.
I mean, I've always loved that ring.

322
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,360
Oh, Mon, I'm sorry.

323
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:53,436
I'd let you have it,
but Emily's gotten really attached to it.

324
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,197
Thanks.

325
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,632
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

326
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:01,905
Emily, did you know that that ring spent
two days in a duck's colon?
