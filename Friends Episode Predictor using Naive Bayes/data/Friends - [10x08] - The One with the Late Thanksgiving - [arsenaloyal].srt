1
00:00:03,148 --> 00:00:04,172
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

2
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:06,146
- Hi.
- Hey.

3
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:08,047
We need to talk about something.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,280
Yeah. We don't feel like we can
host Thanksgiving this year.

5
00:00:11,456 --> 00:00:13,048
- What?
- Are you kidding?

6
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:16,126
Well, it's just with work
and the stress of adoption...

7
00:00:16,295 --> 00:00:18,160
...we don't feel like
we have the energy.

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,699
Plus, we don't think it's fair
that every year the burden falls on us.

9
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:26,167
That doesn't sound like you.

10
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:28,363
That's Monica talking.

11
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:35,277
- No, we made this decision together.
- She's putting words in your mouth.

12
00:00:35,447 --> 00:00:39,076
Don't you put words in people's mouths.
You put turkey in people's mouths.

13
00:00:40,218 --> 00:00:43,710
I can't believe this.
This is Emma's first Thanksgiving.

14
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:48,087
- No, it's not.
- It's not? When was she born?

15
00:00:49,494 --> 00:00:52,759
Well, personally, I think it's great
you're giving yourself a break.

16
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:55,593
- Thank you, Pheebs.
- Sure. It's just as well.

17
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:59,601
I mean, last year wasn't very good.
I think she's losing her touch.

18
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:04,071
- What? You are way off, lady.
- Am l? Really? Am l?

19
00:01:04,242 --> 00:01:07,678
Well, why don't you cook
Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong.

20
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,546
Well, think about it. You'd be trying
to top what you did last year.

21
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:15,812
You'd be in competition with yourself.

22
00:01:17,155 --> 00:01:18,986
That's my favorite kind.

23
00:01:19,491 --> 00:01:21,755
Okay, we are doing this.

24
00:01:21,927 --> 00:01:24,157
Don't let yourself
get manipulated this way.

25
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:28,060
Stay out of this, Chandler.
This is between me and me.

26
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:33,396
We are supposed to make
these decisions together.

27
00:01:33,572 --> 00:01:36,370
Did you not watch
the <i>Dr. Phil</i> I taped for you?

28
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:32,187
- Hey.
- Hi. Happy Thanksgiving.

29
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:34,696
Happy Meatless Turkey-Murder Day.

30
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:39,266
You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies
from that bakery on Bleeker.

31
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:42,236
- Could you pick them up for me?
- You're not making the pies?

32
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:43,874
I don't make chocolate pies.

33
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:46,772
When I was younger,
I entered this pie-eating contest.

34
00:02:46,945 --> 00:02:49,470
I ate so many that the
thought of them makes me sick.

35
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:51,343
Did you at least win the contest?

36
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:54,610
Two minutes, twelve pies
and a part of one tin.

37
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:58,246
- Okay, I'll see you guys at 4.
- Can't wait.

38
00:02:58,423 --> 00:03:03,451
This dinner is gonna be so great.
In your face, last-year me.

39
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:06,054
- Hey, Rach?
- Yeah.

40
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:07,755
What's Emma doing today?

41
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:11,801
Well, let's see, I know that she has
a meeting with her lawyer...

42
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,599
...and then she has to make
a very big poop.

43
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:20,475
- Why?
- I want to enter her in a baby pageant.

44
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:24,479
Oh, my God. That's the creepiest thing
I've ever heard.

45
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:28,278
Okay, but before you say no,
my friend Suzanne is entering her kid.

46
00:03:28,453 --> 00:03:30,717
And compared to Emma,
she's a real dog.

47
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,789
- Phoebe, all babies are beautiful.
- Oh, okay.

48
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,260
No. Phoebe, just the idea
of pitting one baby against another...

49
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:42,696
...l mean, you know, and judging
who's cuter just for a trophy...

50
00:03:42,868 --> 00:03:46,770
- And a thousand dollars.
- ...is something I'm very interested in.

51
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:50,497
Oh, please, do not tell Ross.

52
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:53,508
He still believes that what's
on the inside is important.

53
00:03:53,678 --> 00:03:57,580
Okay. And Emma needs
a cowgirl outfit for the competition.

54
00:03:57,749 --> 00:04:00,479
Where am I gonna get
a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?

55
00:04:00,652 --> 00:04:01,744
Well, I was thinking--

56
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,151
Take the clothes
off Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid!

57
00:04:14,332 --> 00:04:16,027
Did someone drop the baton again?

58
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:19,659
Why come all the way
from Kansas to do that?

59
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,671
I don't get older, I just get better.

60
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:27,941
You know what just occurred to me?

61
00:04:28,113 --> 00:04:30,673
This could be our last Thanksgiving
just the two of us.

62
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:33,113
I mean, we could be getting a baby soon.

63
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:35,753
- You don't know that.
- Somebody's gonna pick us.

64
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:38,583
But we haven't heard a thing
from the adoption agency.

65
00:04:38,757 --> 00:04:40,782
I'm telling you, it's gonna happen.

66
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,225
Next year, it's gonna be you,
me and little Hemingway Bing.

67
00:04:46,832 --> 00:04:49,892
- What? He's my favorite author.
- Name one of his books.

68
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:57,365
<i>The Firm</i>?

69
00:04:58,844 --> 00:05:02,439
Okay, let's see. Okay, the turkey's
in the oven. The stuffing is ready.

70
00:05:02,614 --> 00:05:06,641
You know, you always cook this meal
all by yourself. Let me help this year.

71
00:05:06,818 --> 00:05:08,445
Oh, Chandler, that's sweet.

72
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,283
But you don't have to do everything
Dr. Phil tells you to do.

73
00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:17,895
I'm serious, let me do something.
Just not the turkey. Nothing high-profile.

74
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:20,623
Okay, let's see. Oh, the cranberry sauce.

75
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:23,791
It's easy to make,
and no one really cares about it.

76
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,102
Tell me more.

77
00:05:26,271 --> 00:05:30,935
I'm gonna go check on something across
the hall. You start by washing these.

78
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:35,274
Not with soap!

79
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:42,682
You obviously haven't tasted
my Palmolive potatoes.

80
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:47,853
- Hi. Hey, guess what Joey has.
- Three tickets to today's Rangers game!

81
00:05:48,026 --> 00:05:50,790
Dude, I wanted him to guess.

82
00:05:50,962 --> 00:05:53,522
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, they're great seats too.

83
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:56,565
- Guess where they are.
- Center ice.

84
00:05:57,702 --> 00:05:59,670
Did I do something to you?

85
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:03,935
- The game's at 1.
- So?

86
00:06:04,109 --> 00:06:08,068
- Dinner's at 4. We'll never make it back.
- So we'll leave before it's over.

87
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:10,908
But it could take us
a long time to get back home.

88
00:06:11,082 --> 00:06:15,416
Plus, Joey could get lost and they could
have to page us to go pick him up.

89
00:06:16,454 --> 00:06:18,854
Dude, two times that happened!

90
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:22,553
Look, Monica's
been working hard all day.

91
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:25,491
She didn't want to host
in the first place. We shouldn't go.

92
00:06:25,664 --> 00:06:27,097
He's right, man.

93
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:30,234
- Yeah, I guess. So we'll see you at 4.
- Okay.

94
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:33,394
And get ready to taste
my very special cranberries.

95
00:06:33,571 --> 00:06:36,972
Or should I say "Chan-berries"?

96
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:43,546
That's some gentle comedy, dude.

97
00:06:44,482 --> 00:06:47,542
- We're still going to the game, right?
- Yeah.

98
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,848
<i>This is contestant number 16,</i>
<i>Rebecca Hope from Yonkers.</i>

99
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:58,154
- Hey.
- Phoebe, listen, I think we gotta go.

100
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,729
This place is freaking me out.

101
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:03,925
I've been watching this guy over there.
I don't think he came with a kid.

102
00:07:04,102 --> 00:07:05,399
But we can't leave now.

103
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,834
There was this one baby, Haley,
who was favored to win...

104
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:10,031
...she got croup,
so she had to stay home.

105
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,075
This competition
just blew wide-open, folks.

106
00:07:13,678 --> 00:07:15,873
Phoebe, it's just too weird.

107
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:18,447
I just saw a 1 -year-old
with pantyhose on.

108
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:21,608
Oh, I know. We should've
been more prepared.

109
00:07:22,854 --> 00:07:27,052
It's okay. Now, the way I see it,
our real competition now is Cameron.

110
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:29,090
My God, they just took her sweater off.

111
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,558
Look at those arms.
Hello, Michelin Man.

112
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,496
Phoebe, come on.
You know what, it's already 3:00.

113
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:38,795
They haven't even gotten
to Emma's group yet. We got dinner.

114
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,962
But Emma's got what it takes.
She could go all the way!

115
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:47,944
- Phoebe, you have to calm down.
- Okay.

116
00:07:48,113 --> 00:07:53,676
Rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state
area are in this room right now.

117
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,451
I overheard a judge say that
not one of them holds a candle to Emma.

118
00:07:59,624 --> 00:08:00,989
- Really?
- Yeah.

119
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:03,821
- You heard him say that?
- Yeah.

120
00:08:03,995 --> 00:08:08,091
All right. Okay. All right, let's give
these babies something to cry about.

121
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:12,100
Good. Let's get down to business.
Emma needs some makeup.

122
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,532
What?

123
00:08:13,705 --> 00:08:15,935
She's gonna look washed-out
next to the others.

124
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:18,541
No, I'm not letting you
put makeup on my baby.

125
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,940
- Why not?
- Because I already did.

126
00:08:27,986 --> 00:08:31,945
You suck!
Get off the ice, you idiot!

127
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:35,391
- What a game.
- I know. Yeah.

128
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,791
- I can't believe Chandler's missing this.
- I'm sorry he's not here.

129
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:43,093
But I gotta say,
I am really enjoying nacho chair.

130
00:08:43,268 --> 00:08:47,637
Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more
if you didn't keep batting my hand away.

131
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:51,033
- Yeah!
- These seats are great.

132
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:54,201
I know, I know.
When I was here for "Holidays on lce" ...

133
00:08:55,914 --> 00:09:00,374
...l was sitting so far away,
Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner.

134
00:09:01,219 --> 00:09:03,346
Dude, I'm sure she knows you heart her.

135
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:06,586
I hope so.

136
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:09,989
We'd better get going. If we don't
leave now, we're gonna be late.

137
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:13,790
But it's a tie game. So we're
a little late. The girls will be there.

138
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:16,024
Let's just stay for one more goal.

139
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:17,725
- I don't know.
- One more fight.

140
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:19,836
- Okay.
- Okay.

141
00:09:23,475 --> 00:09:25,773
Where is everybody?
They're 45 minutes late.

142
00:09:25,944 --> 00:09:31,007
I can't believe they're not here.
I slave and I slave for what?

143
00:09:31,182 --> 00:09:34,583
They've ruined Cranberry Day.

144
00:09:35,587 --> 00:09:37,885
- How late are we?
- Forty-five minutes.

145
00:09:38,056 --> 00:09:40,354
- Here.
- Okay.

146
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:44,386
Rachel and Phoebe are already there,
so they probably started without us.

147
00:09:44,562 --> 00:09:47,793
We could just slip in, and no one
needs to know where we were.

148
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,064
- You may want to lose the foam finger.
- Oh, no, no, no.

149
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:55,866
You just want to put it on your hand.

150
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:02,876
- You're not at Thanksgiving?
- No, we're late.

151
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:05,277
- What are you doing here?
- We're late too.

152
00:10:06,518 --> 00:10:09,180
We figured we could be late
because you'd be on time.

153
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:12,448
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani.

154
00:10:12,624 --> 00:10:16,060
- Nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us.
- Yeah, where were you?

155
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:18,627
- Well--
- Yeah, what's with the trophy?

156
00:10:18,796 --> 00:10:22,288
Well, we were at a spelling bee.

157
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:25,297
And I won.

158
00:10:26,037 --> 00:10:30,030
You won an adult
Thanksgiving Day spelling bee?

159
00:10:30,642 --> 00:10:33,805
Yes. Y-E-S. Yes.

160
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:39,382
Let me see this. "Grand Supreme
Little Darling, New York Division"?

161
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:42,019
That's me.

162
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:46,613
You entered Emma in a beauty pageant?

163
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:50,818
And it looks like she put makeup on her.

164
00:10:51,162 --> 00:10:55,155
Wait a second. Where have I seen
that cowgirl outfit before?

165
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:58,731
I can't believe this. She's our daughter.

166
00:10:58,903 --> 00:11:02,600
That you would treat her like
some kind of show dog is inexcusable.

167
00:11:02,774 --> 00:11:06,801
- She won a thousand dollars.
- So this is an annual thing?

168
00:11:10,448 --> 00:11:13,349
That's Alicia May Emory's outfit!

169
00:11:14,786 --> 00:11:17,846
Guys, there are people in there
who are not getting any happier.

170
00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:21,651
- What are we gonna do?
- I gotta put Emma down for a nap.

171
00:11:21,826 --> 00:11:25,125
And, Rach, while you're in there,
throw something on Alicia May.

172
00:11:26,664 --> 00:11:30,828
- All right, what are we gonna say?
- We'll say that we were mugged.

173
00:11:31,002 --> 00:11:33,664
You can't get mad at someone
who's been mugged.

174
00:11:33,838 --> 00:11:36,033
Good. But you don't look
like you were mugged.

175
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:38,471
No. Here.

176
00:11:42,113 --> 00:11:43,410
Hey!

177
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,880
Do you hear something?

178
00:11:52,257 --> 00:11:56,125
- They're out there.
- Let me see.

179
00:11:56,995 --> 00:12:02,399
I can't believe this. They're an hour late,
and they're just standing there talking.

180
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:07,402
Everything's so distorted.
It looks like Joey has a giant hand.

181
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:11,901
That says "Rangers" on it.
They went to the game.

182
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,743
Oh, they are in for a world of pain.

183
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:21,814
- Ross' shirt is torn.
- They're late and they're sloppy.

184
00:12:23,721 --> 00:12:26,383
All right, Emma's napping.
What happened to your shirt?

185
00:12:26,691 --> 00:12:30,422
I got mugged, and they stole my pocket.

186
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:34,527
We're just trying
to figure out an excuse.

187
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:36,922
How about this?

188
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:41,435
We could say that Monica told us 5:00,
not 4:00. That way we're right on time.

189
00:12:41,606 --> 00:12:47,977
Or we could plant PCP in the
apartment and call the cops on her.

190
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:54,209
That would be a good way to get rid
of all the PCP we have lying around.

191
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:56,376
We'll just say that she said it was 5:00.

192
00:12:56,554 --> 00:13:00,285
We'll just act casual.
We're not late, we're right on time.

193
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,322
"We know you're out there."

194
00:13:10,968 --> 00:13:13,436
Who do you think it's from?

195
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:19,137
Oh, God, this is bad. This is so bad.

196
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,608
Well, let's just go in there
and face them.

197
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:26,978
I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on
Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.

198
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:31,019
I hate that thing.
It's like a bolt of lightning.

199
00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:35,216
Why don't we play Rock, Paper, Scissors,
and whoever loses, goes in first.

200
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:37,953
- All right, I'm in.
- Ready.

201
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:44,426
I win.

202
00:13:44,602 --> 00:13:48,231
- What is that?
- That's fire. It beats everything.

203
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:51,466
Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon?

204
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:56,871
Well-played, Phoebe Buffay.
Well-played.

205
00:13:57,048 --> 00:13:59,539
All right,
let's all go in at the same time.

206
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:01,878
- Okay.
- Okay.

207
00:14:03,821 --> 00:14:07,188
- It's locked.
- What? Oh, sure, now they lock it.

208
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:09,519
When they're having sex
on the couch, it's like:

209
00:14:09,694 --> 00:14:12,993
"Come on in,
my butt is surprisingly hairy!"

210
00:14:14,732 --> 00:14:18,828
All right, come on. All right, you guys,
we're so sorry we're late.

211
00:14:19,003 --> 00:14:21,528
Please let us in so we can have
dinner together.

212
00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:26,268
No, everything's cold. The turkey's
dried out and the stuffing's all soggy.

213
00:14:26,444 --> 00:14:29,277
Yeah, and there's a bowl
of cranberry sauce that's--

214
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:31,278
What happens to cranberry sauce?

215
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:34,612
- Nothing, it's fine.
- Oh, thank God.

216
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:38,381
Come on, you guys, we're sorry.
Our subway broke down.

217
00:14:38,556 --> 00:14:42,185
That's a lie! You went to the game.
I can see Joey's hand.

218
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,453
For the love of God, take it off!

219
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,825
Guys, it doesn't matter
why we're late. We're all here now.

220
00:14:51,002 --> 00:14:53,994
Please let us in so we can have
some of your delicious turkey.

221
00:14:56,974 --> 00:15:00,102
I had a dream once
about a fax machine that did that.

222
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:03,706
That's all the turkey you're gonna get.

223
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:07,817
- How are we gonna decide who gets this?
- Water balloon!

224
00:15:12,557 --> 00:15:15,048
What are we gonna do? I'm starving.

225
00:15:15,226 --> 00:15:17,524
I just remembered,
we do have something to eat.

226
00:15:17,695 --> 00:15:20,220
Monica put something
in our oven this morning.

227
00:15:20,398 --> 00:15:22,730
You touch that,
and you will be sorry!

228
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,303
Guys, I'd listen to her.
The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it!

229
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:33,274
Oh, my God, it's Brussels sprouts!

230
00:15:33,444 --> 00:15:35,878
That's worse than no food.

231
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:40,641
All you got was Monica's
stinky Brussels sprouts.

232
00:15:40,818 --> 00:15:42,012
Stinky?

233
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:45,553
Please let me stay
on this side of the door.

234
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:49,352
Oh, I know!
I still have my old key.

235
00:15:49,527 --> 00:15:51,620
We can just unlock the door.

236
00:15:51,796 --> 00:15:54,822
I don't know if that's a good idea.
They don't wanna be with us.

237
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:56,728
I don't wanna be with them either...

238
00:15:56,901 --> 00:16:00,428
...but it's Thanksgiving, and we should
not want to be together together.

239
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:03,438
If I could just get in there,
make a face-to-face apology...

240
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:06,270
...look them in the eye,
I could get them to forgive us.

241
00:16:06,444 --> 00:16:09,174
- I don't know.
- I'm telling you...

242
00:16:11,782 --> 00:16:14,774
...l can do it.

243
00:16:14,952 --> 00:16:17,284
Yeah, he can do it.

244
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:28,695
It all looks so beautiful.

245
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:32,563
- The turkey, the stuffing.
- The cranberries.

246
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:35,900
Enough! A monkey could've made them.

247
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:44,410
Hey, listen, guys,
we feel really terrible.

248
00:16:44,849 --> 00:16:47,818
He's doing that weird eye-contact thing.

249
00:16:47,985 --> 00:16:50,419
Don't look at him. Don't look at him.

250
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:55,184
Come on, you guys. We want
you to know we're very, very sorry.

251
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,487
Right, guys?

252
00:16:58,663 --> 00:17:01,723
- I feel terrible.
- Oh, so sorry.

253
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:06,196
But let's not ruin this day.
You've worked so hard.

254
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,567
Let's move past this and try to have
a nice meal all together, huh?

255
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,868
The floating heads
do make a good point.

256
00:17:13,811 --> 00:17:15,711
Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.

257
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,440
- So bad.
- So bad.

258
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,851
Okay.

259
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:26,649
Okay, you two go get the dessert,
and I'll let you in.

260
00:17:27,258 --> 00:17:29,522
Dessert?

261
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:34,256
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up
the pies. You did remember, right?

262
00:17:34,432 --> 00:17:38,528
Pies. Oh, we thought you said "prize."

263
00:17:39,737 --> 00:17:42,035
Here.

264
00:17:44,475 --> 00:17:48,969
- "Grand Supreme Little Darling"?
- Congratulations!

265
00:17:50,648 --> 00:17:54,311
Oh, my God, you forgot the pies?
Well, I cannot believe this.

266
00:17:54,485 --> 00:17:57,079
You forced me to make dinner,
you're an hour late...

267
00:17:57,254 --> 00:18:00,189
...and you forget the one little thing
that I asked you to do.

268
00:18:00,358 --> 00:18:03,384
Really, girls, not cool.

269
00:18:04,729 --> 00:18:08,324
Well, you man-heads aren't any better.
You lied about going to the game.

270
00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:10,763
You knew it'd make you late,
and you went anyway.

271
00:18:10,935 --> 00:18:13,904
Hey, I'm getting a little tired of this.
We said we're sorry.

272
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:17,632
It's Thanksgiving, for Pete's sakes!
A day of forgiveness.

273
00:18:17,808 --> 00:18:21,835
- It's a day to be thankful.
- Don't make me come up there!

274
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:23,605
It's too late for apologies.

275
00:18:23,781 --> 00:18:26,579
Fine, let's just go.
I don't need your stupid dinner.

276
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:29,686
That would be a lot more convincing
if you weren't drooling.

277
00:18:30,154 --> 00:18:33,385
- Oh, is that what that is?
- Sorry.

278
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:37,389
Come on, you guys,
let's just do our own Thanksgiving.

279
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:40,689
- Yeah, I'll cook.
- Yeah, let's go out.

280
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:45,201
Yeah, you three
have a nice Thanksgiving.

281
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:48,736
- The three of us?
- Yeah. You, Chan and the vein.

282
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:02,750
- I'm stuck.
- Joey, that is not gonna work.

283
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,945
No, seriously.

284
00:19:05,122 --> 00:19:07,613
- I'm really wedged in here.
- I'll pull you through.

285
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:08,850
Okay.

286
00:19:09,527 --> 00:19:12,087
Stop, stop, I'm worried
about damaging my head.

287
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:14,629
It's a little late for that.

288
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,258
Hurry up, you gotta do something.

289
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:19,835
All right, well,
this does not change anything.

290
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:22,131
We need to get something
to grease his face.

291
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:24,399
- We got turkey grease.
- Bring it.

292
00:19:24,575 --> 00:19:28,671
I just want to say that I'm sorry I referred
to the vein as a separate person.

293
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:31,111
Here you go.

294
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:34,483
Oh, that smells good.

295
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:44,891
- Okay?
- Okay, try it.

296
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:48,722
It isn't working.

297
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:52,426
- We're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
- Hurry, I can't feel my ears.

298
00:19:52,603 --> 00:19:55,003
Can you ever feel your ears?

299
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:57,402
Interesting.

300
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,868
- Chandler, where are your tools?
- Oh, I left them on my bulldozer.

301
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:07,209
I don't have tools.

302
00:20:07,718 --> 00:20:10,846
- Well, I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
- I lent them to Ross.

303
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:14,422
- I gave them to Joey.
- I left them at the park.

304
00:20:16,494 --> 00:20:18,928
I'm finding it really hard
not to mess with him.

305
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:21,257
I stuffed Brussels sprouts
down his pants.

306
00:20:21,432 --> 00:20:22,456
Nice.

307
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:25,598
Okay, I have to get that.

308
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,001
Now, when I get back,
I want you and your friends to be gone.

309
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:33,507
Thanksgiving is over.
The vein has spoken.

310
00:20:34,512 --> 00:20:38,846
- It's really starting to hurt.
- Look, I'm gonna pull on the door...

311
00:20:39,016 --> 00:20:43,043
...and you guys push. Maybe we can get
enough room to wiggle him out, okay?

312
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,915
Okay, so push.

313
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:48,456
Just a sec. We're kind of
in the middle of something here.

314
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:51,561
Hey, stop putting things
down my pants.

315
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:54,664
- Come on, guys, push!
- Yeah, come on, push!

316
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:57,027
Push! Push!

317
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:12,072
- My cranberries!
- Man, I got food all over me.

318
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:16,751
I can't believe what you did.
Monica's gonna kill you.

319
00:21:17,555 --> 00:21:21,582
Look! Look! Look what the--
Look what the floating heads did!

320
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,087
I don't care.

321
00:21:26,997 --> 00:21:29,431
What's going on?

322
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,693
That was the adoption agency.

323
00:21:32,436 --> 00:21:34,301
And?

324
00:21:34,471 --> 00:21:38,601
- We're getting a baby!
- Are you serious?!

325
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:47,511
There's a pregnant woman in Ohio,
and she picked us.

326
00:21:47,685 --> 00:21:50,950
- Oh, my God, that's great!
- That's incredible.

327
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:55,348
I'm so happy for you.

328
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:59,892
This Thanksgiving
kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!

329
00:22:06,537 --> 00:22:10,997
To Monica and Chandler
and that knocked-up girl in Ohio.

330
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,040
I'm just so happy you guys
are finally getting a kid.

331
00:22:20,084 --> 00:22:23,542
I know. Have you considered pageanting?

332
00:22:25,189 --> 00:22:30,183
I can't believe they called.
I mean, we're actually getting a baby.

333
00:22:30,361 --> 00:22:32,226
I know how you feel.

334
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:35,755
- Really?
- Sure.

335
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:39,061
I went through the exact same thing
with Alicia May Emory.

336
00:22:41,972 --> 00:22:44,167
The waiting, the wondering.

337
00:22:44,341 --> 00:22:48,778
Then one day,
I get that call from Toys"R"Us.

338
00:22:48,946 --> 00:22:51,881
She was in stock.

339
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,279
That is the exact same thing.
