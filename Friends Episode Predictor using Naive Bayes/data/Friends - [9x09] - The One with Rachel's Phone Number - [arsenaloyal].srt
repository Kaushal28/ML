1
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:06,769
This kitty is Mittens.
This one is Fitzhugh.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,841
And this IittIe guy
in the cat condo is Jinkies.

3
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:15,346
That's a Iot of cats, Jo Lynn.

4
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:16,641
SingIe, are you?

5
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,989
-I'II get it.
-<i>Okay.</i>

6
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,283
ChandIer Bing.

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,089
<i>How come you're answering your own</i>
<i>phone? Where's your crazy assistant?</i>

8
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,591
You're not crazy. You're not crazy.

9
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,601
Otherwise, why wouId you
have aII those cats?

10
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:39,662
What's up, Joe?

11
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,000
What have we aIways wanted
to do together?

12
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,835
Braid each other's hair
and ride horseback on the beach?

13
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,412
No. No. No. When you get home
tomorrow night...

14
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,982
...you and I are gonna be
at the Wizards-Knicks game, courtside!

15
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,652
-Courtside? Oh, my God!
-<i>Yeah!</i>

16
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:57,653
Maybe MichaeI Jordan wiII dive for
the baII and break my jaw with his knee!

17
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,155
That is so cooI. I'II Iet Monica know.

18
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:04,991
These need your signature.

19
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,328
Listen, Jo Lynn, that was my friend Joey.
He caIIs everybody crazy.

20
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,059
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hey, hon, it's me.

21
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,763
<i>Hi. How's the crazy cat lady?</i>

22
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,033
Joey just caIIed.

23
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,974
He's got courtside Knicks tickets
for him and me tomorrow night.

24
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:23,513
But tomorrow night's the onIy night
I get off from the restaurant.

25
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,277
If you go, we won't have
a night together for a week.

26
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:30,685
But honey, it's courtside!
The cheerIeaders wiII be right in--

27
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,758
That's not the way to convince you.

28
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,088
I don't wanna be one
of those wives that says:

29
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,163
''You can't go to the game.
You have to spend time with me.''

30
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,698
So if you couId just reaIize it
on your own....

31
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,930
I know. You're right.
I wanna see you too.

32
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,269
I gotta figure out a way to teII Joey.
He's Iooking forward to it.

33
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,933
<i>Tell him you haven't seen</i>
<i>your wife in a long time.</i>

34
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,979
TeII him that having a Iong-distance
reIationship is reaIIy difficuIt.

35
00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:00,279
TeII him that what IittIe time
we have together is precious.

36
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:03,121
I'II think of something.

37
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,305
You Iook....

38
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:06,646
I mean, it's just....
That dress....

39
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:09,782
WeII, I hope the ends
of these sentences are good.

40
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:13,153
They're good. It's just been a whiIe
since I've seen you Iike this.

41
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,317
You cIean up good.

42
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,586
ReaIIy? WeII, thank you.

43
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,667
Okay, stop Iooking at me Iike that.

44
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,772
-Last time that happened, that happened.
-Right, right.

45
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:37,214
So are you excited about
your first night away from Emma?

46
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,874
Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I
are gonna have so much fun.

47
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,987
-Thank you for watching the baby.
-It's fine.

48
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,283
ActuaIIy, I invited Mike over.

49
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,482
-Phoebe's Mike?
-Yeah.

50
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,784
-I didn't know you hung out.
-We don't...

51
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,792
...but I'd Iike to get to know him.

52
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,899
Maybe have a IittIe dinner,
drinks, conversation.

53
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,829
That's so cute.
Ross and Mike's first date.

54
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,135
It's not a date.

55
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,536
But if it turns out to be
something more...

56
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,609
...I'II Ieave a tie on the door.

57
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,240
WiII that be awkward?
What are you gonna taIk about?

58
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,747
I don't know. But you know, we have
a Iot in common, you know?

59
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,944
He pIays piano.
I pIayed keyboards in coIIege.

60
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:20,284
He's been divorced.
I have some experience in that area.

61
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,657
-Yeah?
-Hi!

62
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,502
GirI's night out indeed.

63
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,138
So I think Emma is probabIy
down for the night...

64
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,501
-...but if you need anything--
-We'II be fine.

65
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,609
-You go have fun.
-Okay, you too.

66
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,143
-Thanks.
-And I hope you score.

67
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,880
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

68
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,643
So, weIcome.

69
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,620
-I got beer.
-I got bottIed breast miIk.

70
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,456
-Why don't we start with the beer.
-Okay.

71
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:02,361
-So Phoebe teIIs me you pIay piano.
-Yeah.

72
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,333
You know, I used to pIay keyboards
in coIIege.

73
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,203
Do you have one here?

74
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,433
No.

75
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,539
Okay.

76
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,261
You know, I'm divorced.

77
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,662
Phoebe-- Phoebe says you're--
You've been divorced?

78
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,032
Yeah, yeah.

79
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,106
Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't reaIIy Iike
to taIk about it.

80
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,039
That's okay. We'II taIk about
something eIse.

81
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,856
-This is a nice apartment.
-Thanks.

82
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,619
The moIdings are aII originaI.

83
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:09,258
I don't know if the moIdings
are originaI in my apartment.

84
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,813
-So you're a paIeontoIogist, right?
-Yeah.

85
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,972
My cousin's a paIeontoIogist.

86
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:32,816
WeII, he and I wouId probabIy have
a Iot to taIk about.

87
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,563
-WeIcome home.
-WeII, Iook at you.

88
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,394
Yeah. What do you think?

89
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,826
WeII, it Iooks great. It's just--

90
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:48,269
I'm wearing the same thing
underneath, so....

91
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,972
You see what I mean?

92
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:55,569
Hey! How come your door's Iocked?

93
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,716
-Just a second!
-No, no, no!

94
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,545
-Joey can't know I'm here.
-Why not?

95
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,119
I didn't want to say
I couIdn't go to the game...

96
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,519
-...so I toId him I had to stay in TuIsa.
-So you Iied to him?

97
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:09,525
It's aIways better to Iie than to have
the compIicated discussion.

98
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,858
Except with you.

99
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,862
Hey, open the door! What's going on?

100
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,974
-What are you--?
-Hi.

101
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,770
Why are you dressed Iike that?

102
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,479
Because ChandIer's gonna be home
in a coupIe of days...

103
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,517
...so I thought I wouId just, you know,
practice the art of seduction.

104
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,811
I thought I heard a man's voice before.

105
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,752
No, I was just doing ChandIer's side
of the conversation.

106
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,257
You know, Iike, ''Hi, how do I Iook?''

107
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:45,727
''ReaIIy sexy. CouId I be any more
turned on?'' You know?

108
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,994
Okay. Wait a minute.

109
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,135
Why are there two gIasses
of wine out?

110
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,661
Because one of them is for you!

111
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:00,077
Cheers! Okay, bye-bye.

112
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:06,548
You know, it's funny. I've been
practicing the art of seduction myseIf.

113
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,346
-You might wanna keep practicing.
-Yeah.

114
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,293
-It's Joey.
-What?

115
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,454
-Hey, Joe.
-Dude, come home!

116
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,696
-What? Why?
-Come home!

117
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,768
Look, I can't. What's going on?

118
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,773
I don't know how to teII you this,
but I think Monica's cheating on you!

119
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:33,878
I toId you, you shouIdn't have married
someone hotter than you!

120
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,447
If you can't deaI with this,
then I'm gonna.

121
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,984
-No!
-I just heard him!

122
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,881
Can you hear him now?

123
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,457
No. AII right, I'm going in.

124
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,221
-No, wait!
-I heard him again!

125
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,999
AII right, just stay there.
I'm coming home.

126
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,694
I'II see you when you get here.

127
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,136
I'II wait out in the haII
in case he comes out.

128
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,811
-Is that reaIIy necessary?
-AbsoIuteIy. You'd do it for me.

129
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:10,608
Not that you ever have to, because
I know how to keep my women satisfied.

130
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,615
-Yeah, Iisten, thanks a Iot.
-<i>Okay, bye.</i>

131
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,345
He thinks I'm a sIut.

132
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:20,720
Oh, right, and you're
supposed to be a fireman?

133
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,137
ShouIdn't the pizza be here by now?

134
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:40,940
I mean, they said 30 minutes or Iess.
WeII, how Iong has it been?

135
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,480
EIeven minutes.

136
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,014
And now 1 2.

137
00:09:56,362 --> 00:10:00,059
-So you wanna watch TV?
-You think I haven't thought of that?

138
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,699
I mean, I wouId Iike to
but the cabIe's out.

139
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:08,305
Didn't seem Iike such a big deaI
untiI tonight.

140
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:17,573
-So you Iike the beer?
-I do. I do.

141
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,516
AIthough, it's actuaIIy a Iager.

142
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,650
What's the difference
between beer and Iager?

143
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,417
I don't know.

144
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,325
We couId Iook it up.

145
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,566
Things are about to get wiId.

146
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,500
Oh, God, remember the girIs' nights
we used to have...

147
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,805
...sitting around taIking
about you and Ross?

148
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,414
Oh, God! It seems Iike forever ago.

149
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,607
I know.

150
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,419
So, what's going on
with you and Ross?

151
00:10:56,188 --> 00:11:01,251
WeII, I don't know. I mean,
for a Iong time, nothing.

152
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,193
But you know, actuaIIy,
right before you picked me up...

153
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,924
...Ross and I had a IittIe thing.

154
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:11,103
Oh, my God! I Iove things!
What happened?

155
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:14,602
WeII, first he toId me
he Iiked how I Iooked.

156
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:18,642
And then we had a IittIe...

157
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,009
...eye contact.

158
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,643
Eye contact?

159
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,613
I hope you were using protection.

160
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:34,289
Excuse me, these are from
the two gentIemen at the end of the bar.

161
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:39,086
Oh, actuaIIy, I can't have another one
on account of my breast miIk.

162
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,760
Okay.

163
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:46,702
Hey, Rach, maybe there's a Iess
disgusting way to decIine a drink.

164
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:52,336
ShouId we send them something back?
Let's send them mashed potatoes!

165
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,876
No, wait! Don't do that!

166
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,037
That'II make them think
they can come over.

167
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,545
So, what if they do?

168
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:03,188
We're not here to meet guys. You have
a boyfriend. I have a baby and a Ross.

169
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:07,915
Yeah, but nothing has to happen.
We're just having fun.

170
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:12,155
You know, not everything has to go
as far as eye contact.

171
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,794
ChandIer, you have to teII Joey
you're not in TuIsa.

172
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,732
Isn't it better for him
to think you're cheating on me...

173
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,738
...than for him to think
I'm cheating on him?

174
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,739
I heard it.

175
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,712
I don't want him to think
I'm having an affair.

176
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,177
AII right, I've got a pIan.
I'II go down the fire escape--

177
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,546
Because aII good pIans start with,
''I'II go down the fire escape.''

178
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,119
Hear me out, woman!

179
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,982
I'II go down the fire escape and wait.

180
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,717
Then it'II be Iike I just got back
from TuIsa.

181
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,887
Joey and I wiII come in
and see that there's no guy in here.

182
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,499
Aren't you afraid that Joey's
gonna figure aII this out?

183
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,296
I heard it.

184
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,207
-I'm gonna wait.
-The scary pigeon's back?

185
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,475
It's huge.

186
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:43,720
I can't beIieve you Iive in that buiIding.
My grandmother Iives in that buiIding!

187
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,323
Ida Greene? No sense
of personaI space...

188
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,983
...kind of smeIIs Iike chicken,
Iooks Iike a potato.

189
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,891
-''Spuds'' is your grandmother?
-That's my <i>bubbe</i>!

190
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:58,170
So we're on our way
to a coupIe of parties.

191
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,636
Maybe we couId get your numbers
and caII if we find something fun?

192
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,673
Yeah. I'm sorry, we weren't reaIIy
Iooking for anything to happen...

193
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,370
...with you guys. I have a boyfriend.

194
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,706
-AII right.
-It's no big deaI.

195
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,018
Just out of curiosity,
which one of you was for me?

196
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,689
-That wouId've been me.
-Nice.

197
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,690
Different situation, cowboy,
and you wouId've had yourseIf a handfuI.

198
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:31,927
So she has a boyfriend.
What is your situation?

199
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,898
WeII, it's compIicated.
I don't actuaIIy have a boyfriend, but--

200
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,599
Then can I have your number?

201
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,940
I'm sorry, no.

202
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,505
Okay.

203
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,279
Oh, sure!

204
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,950
Oh, my God, you're giving
your reaI number!

205
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,092
Okay, thanks. I'II give you
a caII Iater tonight.

206
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,158
-Great.
-Bye.

207
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,590
Bye.

208
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,260
So that's great.

209
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:05,130
You, BiII, Ross and Emma are
gonna be so happy together.

210
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,737
What were you thinking?

211
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:10,340
I don't know. He was cute,
and he Iiked me. It was an impuIse.

212
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:14,609
Like when I bought these shoes.
They were cute and they Iiked me too.

213
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,377
But what about Ross?
What about your moment?

214
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,452
We had a moment.
We Iooked at each other.

215
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:24,715
Maybe if we Iive together
for another 1 0 years, we may hoId hands!

216
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,616
But you were reaIIy excited about it.

217
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,818
-Don't you wanna taIk to him?
-No.

218
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:33,123
No, because I know exactIy
how the conversation's gonna go.

219
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,325
''Hey, Ross, you know, I think
we had a moment before.''

220
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,801
''Yeah. Me too.''

221
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,339
''WeII, but I'm not sure I reaIIy want
to do anything about it.''

222
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,672
''Yeah. Me neither.''

223
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,506
''ShouId we just Iive together...

224
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,842
...and not teII each other
how we're feeIing?''

225
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,951
''Yeah, that works for me.''

226
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,622
Yeah, I see what you mean.

227
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,055
By the way, nice Ross imitation.

228
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,784
Your RacheI wasn't whiny enough.

229
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,462
-WeII-- Hey!
-Better.

230
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:11,059
The point is maybe I shouId just stop
waiting around for moments with Ross.

231
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:14,433
You know? I shouId just
move on with my Iife.

232
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,540
So reaIIy, you're moving on from Ross?

233
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,042
I don't know.
Do I have to decide right now?

234
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:23,181
You kind of just did.
That guy is gonna caII you tonight.

235
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,341
Ross wiII pick up the phone,
and that's a pretty cIear message.

236
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,247
Oh, my God, Ross!

237
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,547
Ross is gonna pick up the phone.

238
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,749
I have to get my number back.
Oh, my God, he's gone!

239
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,485
''Oh, I have to get my number back!
Oh, my God! He's gone!'' Dead on.

240
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,777
-You know, I'm gonna take off.
-So soon?

241
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,312
-Yeah.
-Okay.

242
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,007
WeII, thanks-- Thanks for the beer.

243
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,847
-You mean Iager?
-Yeah. Good times.

244
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,388
-Okay.
-AII right.

245
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,573
-HeIIo?
-Hey, Mike, it's me.

246
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,679
Listen, is-- Is Ross near you?

247
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,405
No, I just Ieft.

248
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,649
And that, right there, is the most interesting
conversation I've had aII night.

249
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,847
ReaIIy? Okay.

250
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,785
WeII, you have to go back in.

251
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:44,187
What? Go back? To the Iand
where time stands stiII?

252
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,522
I'm so sorry, honey, but--

253
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,689
Okay, RacheI gave this guy
her number...

254
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,199
...and she doesn't want Ross
to answer the phone.

255
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,394
So you have to intercept aII his caIIs.

256
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,098
I can't do that!

257
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:58,299
-He says he can't do that.
-Give me the phone.

258
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:02,140
Hi, Mike. Hi, Iisten, I know that this
is a Iot to ask, but you know what?

259
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:07,684
If you do this, Phoebe wiII do
anything you want.

260
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:12,051
-SeriousIy, I'm taIking dirty stuff.
-AII right. Thank you. HeIIo?

261
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:16,126
Hi, I'm sorry about her. But actuaIIy,
she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.

262
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,687
AII right, I'II do it.

263
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,568
But reaIIy, how much dirtier
can it get?

264
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,305
Oh, Mike.

265
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,205
Bye.

266
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,977
Hey, buddy.

267
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,075
Hi.

268
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,251
-Can I come back in?
-Why?

269
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:51,323
WeII, I was just thinking about
how much more we have to taIk about.

270
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,856
But you Ieft.

271
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,998
That didn't take Iong.

272
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,767
I thought you said TuIsa was,
Iike, a three-hour fIight?

273
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,342
WeII, you're forgetting
about the time difference.

274
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,351
-You ready? I'm gonna go in there with you.
-Thanks.

275
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,017
Just in case there's more
than one dude in there.

276
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,129
-Again, thanks.
-Yeah.

277
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,532
ChandIer, you're home!

278
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:34,331
That's right! Your husband's home!
So now the sex can stop!

279
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,913
You know what I mean.

280
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,409
What are you saying?

281
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,482
Joey said you're here
with another man!

282
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,417
There's no man in here!
How dare you accuse me of that!

283
00:19:54,526 --> 00:20:00,123
AII right. Then maybe you won't mind
if me and my friend take a Iook around.

284
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,299
He can't even see us!

285
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,803
-I kind of Iiked it.
-Me too.

286
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,968
What's he doing?

287
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:16,705
I arranged some piIIows on the bed
to Iook Iike a guy.

288
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:23,182
Bedroom's cIear. AIthough you might
need some new piIIows.

289
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:26,514
AII right, weII, I'II check
the guest room.

290
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,394
Why do I smeII men's coIogne?

291
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,799
I think that's you.

292
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:47,369
Oh, yeah. I rubbed a magazine
on myseIf earIier.

293
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,174
There's nobody here, Joe.

294
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,007
I guess not.

295
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:56,821
I can't beIieve you thought I was cheating.
You owe me an apoIogy.

296
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,918
-You're right. I'm so sorry.
-It's an honest mistake.

297
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,219
It couId happen to anybody. See you.

298
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,794
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

299
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:09,127
If you just got back from TuIsa,
how did your suitcase beat you here?

300
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:16,205
I cIimbed down the fire escape,
and you can't put that in the cIoset?

301
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,077
So, with the exception
of the fermentation process...

302
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:26,649
...beer and aIe are
basicaIIy the same thing.

303
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,247
Fascinating, isn't it?

304
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,880
Maybe you shouId Iook up ''fascinating.''

305
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,095
I'II get it!

306
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:46,160
HeIIo? Ross' pIace. Mike speaking.

307
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,472
It's for you.

308
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,743
I don't understand
what just happened here.

309
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,812
What's going on?

310
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,112
I'm sorry.

311
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:06,417
I toId you I was in TuIsa because I
wanted to spend the night with Monica...

312
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:10,425
...and I didn't know--
I didn't think you'd understand.

313
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:15,296
You think I'm too dumb to understand
a husband needs to be with his wife?

314
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,595
You think I'm, Iike....

315
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,702
-Joey?
-Yeah.

316
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,272
I don't know what to say.
We shouIdn't have Iied to you.

317
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,711
I feeI so bad. Is there anything
I can do to make it up to you?

318
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,552
You couId go to the game with me.
Even though you said you couIdn't.

319
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:41,182
But then you Iied to me and tricked me
and gave me a bump on the head.

320
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,294
I'm sorry, that's the one thing I can't do.
I promised I'd be with Monica.

321
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,193
AII right.

322
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,729
-You can go.
-What?

323
