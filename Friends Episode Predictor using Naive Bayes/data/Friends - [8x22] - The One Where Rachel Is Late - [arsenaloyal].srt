1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,957
What are you looking at?

2
00:00:06,165 --> 00:00:10,211
A poster for that WWI movie I'm in.
Check it out.

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,047
Wow! It looks really violent!

4
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:15,675
I know. I'm coming soon
to a theater near you.

5
00:00:15,842 --> 00:00:18,469
I'm in THX.
I'm unsuitable for children!

6
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:24,058
-I cannot wait to see this.
-It's generating Oscar buzz.

7
00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:27,603
-I started that!
-I thought I did!

8
00:00:27,812 --> 00:00:29,897
I just talked to my agent..

9
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:34,068
and the premiere is next week
and you're all invited!

10
00:00:34,277 --> 00:00:36,279
-Will we take a limo?
-Sure!

11
00:00:36,696 --> 00:00:40,408
I love taking limos
when nobody died.

12
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:42,785
Well, I won't be able to come.

13
00:00:42,994 --> 00:00:47,290
For those who haven't checked
their calendars, today's my due date.

14
00:00:47,457 --> 00:00:50,042
You should come.
Maybe you'll have the baby in the limo.

15
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:53,963
That way for the first few moments of
her life, she'll think we're really fancy.

16
00:00:55,465 --> 00:00:59,761
I want to thank you guys
for how great you've been during this.

17
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:04,223
I couldn't have done it without you.
I loved these last 9 months.

18
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,684
I'm looking forward
to the next part..

19
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,604
I am really gonna miss
being pregnant.

20
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,820
That's right. Still no baby.

21
00:01:19,238 --> 00:01:21,783
What's the matter? Is the puffy,
sweaty pregnant lady..

22
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:24,076
disturbing your precious
coffee time?

23
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:28,039
Come on, people, make some room.

24
00:01:28,206 --> 00:01:32,043
Sweetie, maybe you'd be
more comfortable here.

25
00:01:33,377 --> 00:01:34,962
You.

26
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:40,635
Like you haven't done enough.

27
00:01:41,803 --> 00:01:46,098
I know you're miserable.
I wish there was something I could do.

28
00:01:46,265 --> 00:01:49,685
I wish I were a sea horse.

29
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:56,275
Because with sea horses, it's the male.
They carry the babies.

30
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:02,782
And then also,
I'd be far away in the sea.

31
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:16,963
God.

32
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:22,844
I have never been so uncomfortable
in my entire life.

33
00:02:23,094 --> 00:02:25,471
I know. I remember toward the end..

34
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,726
That's a great story. Tell it while
you're getting me some iced tea.

35
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:37,650
Oh, God, get out!
Get out, get out, get out!

36
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:41,070
Let's.

37
00:03:22,695 --> 00:03:25,656
Hey, did you have the baby yet?

38
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:31,454
Do you want me to sit on you?
Because I'll do it.

39
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,708
-What are you doing here?
-They sent me home from work.

40
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:39,378
They said, "Start your maternity
leave now. Just rest."

41
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:41,547
You know what? Screw them!

42
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:45,593
If they don't want me there,
I'll hang out with you guys.

43
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:49,930
Or you could do volunteer work.

44
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:54,143
-Hello?
-Joey, it's Estelle.

45
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:59,440
I was able to get you and one guest
tickets to your premiere.

46
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:04,445
-You told me I could have six tickets.
-I sold four on eBay.

47
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:09,408
You'll be sitting next to HotGuy 372.

48
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:14,330
So that's it? I only get
to bring one guest?

49
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,751
Yeah. What time you
wanna pick me up?

50
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,795
Hello?

51
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:25,091
You hear that? I only get one
extra ticket to my premiere.

52
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:29,595
So somehow I have to pick
between you three and Ross.

53
00:04:31,263 --> 00:04:34,809
-What about me?
-You said you didn't want to go.

54
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:37,979
I don't. But I would
still like to be acknowledged.

55
00:04:38,187 --> 00:04:43,150
-Because I'm pregnant, I'm invisible?
-Definitely not invisible.

56
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,990
Ross didn't care enough
to be here, so he's out.

57
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:53,077
-You snooze, you lose.
-He's not snoozing. He's teaching.

58
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:55,538
Well, then somebody's snoozing.

59
00:04:55,705 --> 00:05:01,085
And, Joey, not that this should affect
you at all, but if you pick me..

60
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:06,966
I was planning on wearing
a sequin dress cut down to here.

61
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:10,720
-I haven't seen this dress.
-Star in a movie.

62
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:17,476
Pick whoever you want. Listen
to your heart. What does it tell you?

63
00:05:17,643 --> 00:05:19,645
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe.

64
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,899
Well..

65
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,030
I think I want to take Chandler.

66
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,991
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.

67
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:38,622
-You want to take me?
-Yeah, I wish I could take everybody.

68
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:41,834
But Chandler's always
supported my career.

69
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:45,504
He's paid for acting classes,
headshots and stuff.

70
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:48,424
This will be my way
of paying you back.

71
00:05:48,632 --> 00:05:52,762
So you're never actually
going to pay me back?

72
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:58,517
Just because he paid for your
headshots, you're gonna take him?

73
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:03,856
I don't think you're comprehending
just how slutty this dress is.

74
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:09,278
It's not just the stuff he paid for.
It's everything, you know?

75
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,574
He read lines with me. He went with me
on auditions when I was nervous.

76
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:17,077
Then he consoled me
after I didn't get parts that I wanted.

77
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:20,873
You always believed in me, man,
even when I didn't.

78
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:25,252
I always knew you were gonna make it.
I'm so proud of you.

79
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,631
Thanks, that means a lot to me.

80
00:06:31,884 --> 00:06:35,930
Mon, maybe one of these guys
wants to wear your dress.

81
00:06:36,388 --> 00:06:41,560
-I'm gonna go shave.
-Yeah, well, I'm gonna go spit.

82
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,067
I have to pee.

83
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:53,572
If I don't come out, it's because I've
choked to death on the potpourri stink.

84
00:06:55,115 --> 00:07:01,413
You hold her nose, I'll blow in her
mouth and the kid'll just.. out of her.

85
00:07:02,998 --> 00:07:06,252
She's a week late.
She's got to have it today.

86
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:10,798
I don't know. I think
it's still gonna be a while.

87
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,509
Care to make it interesting?

88
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,138
-I bet you she'll have it tomorrow.
-You're on.

89
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:20,933
-Okay, how much?
-One hundred thousand dollars.

90
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:27,314
-How about 50 bucks?
-I'll call Zurich and move some money.

91
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:31,026
All right, whose turn is it
to help me get up?

92
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,113
No one's here.

93
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,951
Oh, damn it!

94
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:57,177
This is exciting. So glamorous! People
taking our picture. How do I look?

95
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:00,347
-A little tall.
-What?

96
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:04,810
Would you crouch down a bit
so that I look taller?

97
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,355
There you go.

98
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:12,735
It's just so glamorous.

99
00:08:16,238 --> 00:08:19,199
Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.

100
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,286
And you're still pregnant.

101
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:25,539
I'm sorry. I know
how uncomfortable you are.

102
00:08:25,748 --> 00:08:30,753
You know what? You look great.
Yeah, like 50 bucks.

103
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:38,260
I have to go pee. Apparently this baby
thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.

104
00:08:40,095 --> 00:08:43,682
Damn it. Here's your 50 bucks.

105
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:49,104
That's interesting that you lost.
Now, I forget, do you like to lose?

106
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:51,523
All right, stop it.

107
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:54,902
-Double or nothing she has it tomorrow.
-Fine.

108
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:00,866
Until then, General Grant, why don't
you set up camp.. right there?

109
00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:05,663
-Rachel here? We have an appointment.
-In the bathroom.

110
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:09,124
-Rach, we gotta go.
-In a minute!

111
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:16,632
People ask why we're not together.
I just don't know what to tell them.

112
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,259
All right, let's go.

113
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,720
Oh, wait a minute.

114
00:09:21,887 --> 00:09:23,555
Do I have to pee again?

115
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,849
No, I'm good.

116
00:09:26,016 --> 00:09:28,352
Do you want to go change first?

117
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,439
The doctor's staying open late for us,
but if you hurry..

118
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:37,361
-No, I'm fine.
-You don't think that's inappropriate?

119
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:41,240
-What?
-Good God, man. Don't anger it.

120
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:50,791
Ross, it is 100 degrees outside.
For the first time in weeks, I am..

121
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,586
Fine. Whatever you want.
You're the mommy.

122
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,755
No! Don't call me "Mommy."

123
00:09:57,006 --> 00:10:00,801
It's bad enough you call
your own mother that.

124
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,887
I'm actually with her on this one.

125
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:07,558
Come on, Ross.
We're gonna be late.

126
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,478
Either of you want to be Ross?

127
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:22,197
I thought I knew who the enemy was,
but it was you.

128
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:26,952
Okay, this is it. This is
my big fight scene coming up.

129
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:31,165
I'm fighting for every man
in the 82nd Ground Division.

130
00:10:39,798 --> 00:10:43,343
Ross?
Can I ask you something?

131
00:10:43,594 --> 00:10:47,598
When Carol was pregnant with Ben..

132
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:50,809
were you this irritating?

133
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:56,523
-Excuse me?
-Nothing. You're just..

134
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:01,987
You've been a little short with me
lately. I'm not trying to irritate you.

135
00:11:02,154 --> 00:11:06,158
Well, then, you must have
a natural talent for it.

136
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:10,954
The doctor will be in soon.
Why don't we not speak until then?

137
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:12,456
Okay.

138
00:11:16,835 --> 00:11:20,172
Seriously. Breathe louder, Ross.
That's great.

139
00:11:23,425 --> 00:11:26,553
We should ask the doctor
if she even knows..

140
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,184
how to deliver a baby
that's half human, half pure evil!

141
00:11:34,686 --> 00:11:37,731
-Hi, Dr. Long. How are you?
-You're nice to her.

142
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,901
She has the drugs.

143
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,196
We'll do a quick check.

144
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:48,200
Eight days late, huh?
You must be getting uncomfortable.

145
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:50,953
Yeah, just a tad.

146
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:56,875
You're 80% effaced. You're on your way.
It still could last a while.

147
00:11:57,084 --> 00:12:02,214
-There are ways to help things along.
-Do them!

148
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:06,969
Actually, they're things
that you can do. Home remedies.

149
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:10,973
In my experience, I've found
some are very effective.

150
00:12:11,223 --> 00:12:16,812
-Well, we are ready to try anything.
-There's an herbal tea you can drink.

151
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:20,732
You can take some castor oil.
There's spicy foods.

152
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,734
We will do all of those.

153
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,279
-Taking a long walk.
-Good. Done.

154
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:29,241
And there's the one that's
proved most effective: sex.

155
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:38,709
You've got to be kidding me!

156
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:54,600
Good job, Joe! Well done! Top-notch!

157
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:58,479
-You liked it? You really liked it?
-Oh, yeah!

158
00:12:58,687 --> 00:13:03,192
-Well, which part exactly?
-The whole thing! Here we go!

159
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:05,819
No, no, no. Give me some specifics.

160
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:10,073
I loved the specifics.
The specifics were the best part.

161
00:13:10,282 --> 00:13:16,121
Hey, what about the scene with
the kangaroo? Did you like that part?

162
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:21,960
I was surprised to see a kangaroo
in a World War I epic.

163
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,297
You fell asleep!

164
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:30,636
There was no kangaroo! They didn't
take any of my suggestions!

165
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:36,058
-I can't believe you fell asleep.
-I can't believe it either.

166
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:40,062
Maybe it didn't happen.

167
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:43,398
Maybe you fell asleep
and dreamt the whole thing.

168
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:47,778
And this conversation we're having
right now is part of that dream.

169
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:49,947
Wake up, Joe!

170
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:59,915
-Thanks for coming. See you later.
-Don't go. I'm so sorry.

171
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:04,294
Look, this guy fell asleep!
He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!

172
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:07,339
Or call an ambulance!

173
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:16,181
What did the doctor say?
Any news on when the baby will come?

174
00:14:16,348 --> 00:14:19,810
No. She gave us ideas
on how to induce labor.

175
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:21,395
We tried them all.

176
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:27,359
We went for a walk, we tried tea,
castor oil, spicy food. Nothing worked.

177
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:29,945
There is one thing we didn't try.

178
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:34,241
But someone thinks that
that will open up a can of worms.

179
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:38,287
If it's gonna help
bring the baby here, today..

180
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:41,039
I think you should do it.

181
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,919
-It's sex.
-Do it!

182
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:49,923
-Monica.
-It's been a really long time for you.

183
00:14:50,132 --> 00:14:55,512
I mean, women have needs.
Do it. Get yours.

184
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:58,640
Oh, I don't know about that.

185
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:06,315
I think if the two of you had sex, the
repercussions would be catastrophic.

186
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,526
All right, let's be practical.

187
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:15,824
If Ross isn't willing, he's not
the only guy you can have sex with.

188
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:19,369
You could borrow Chandler.
Chandler is good.

189
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:24,583
Okay, okay. Yeah,
I don't think I wanna do that.

190
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,586
You sure? I'm just saying..

191
00:15:27,753 --> 00:15:30,255
the baby's head
isn't getting any smaller.

192
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:36,303
Monica, what is the matter with you?

193
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:40,057
-I just want the baby to be born today.
-Why today?

194
00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:42,934
Okay, fine.

195
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:48,190
I bet Phoebe that you're gonna have
the baby, and I don't want to lose.

196
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:54,071
What? While she's been going through
this hell, you've been making money?

197
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:58,784
You're betting on your friend
staying in this misery?

198
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:04,623
-I'll take that bet.
-What?

199
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,835
I'm miserable. I may as well
make some money out of it.

200
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:11,338
Can I get some of that action?

201
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,965
I'm betting against all of you?

202
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:17,135
I really feel like
tomorrow it's gonna happen.

203
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,096
Okay.

204
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:25,644
Sixty, 80, 100.

205
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,979
And 50.

206
00:16:28,814 --> 00:16:30,190
And two.

207
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,735
Yeah, baby.

208
00:16:40,492 --> 00:16:43,662
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.

209
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,083
Where have you been? I want
to talk to you. I still feel bad.

210
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,837
Oh, no. Were you upset?
Did you lose sleep?

211
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:54,005
I'm so sorry.

212
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:58,802
The reason I came over is to settle things
between us. You've done a lot for me.

213
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:02,431
I wanted to pay you back
with the premiere, but you missed it.

214
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:04,933
-So how much do I owe you?
-What?

215
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:08,770
-I don't want to owe you anything.
-You don't owe me.

216
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,523
-I don't want your..
-We're doing this!

217
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:14,609
You got me my first headshots.
How much?

218
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:19,281
-I don't know, $500.
-Okay, $500. What else?

219
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:24,286
Then there was the second set.
The infamous "booger" headshots.

220
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,624
Okay, so that's another $500.
That's 500 and 500. That's..

221
00:17:33,962 --> 00:17:37,007
-You want a calculator?
-Please.

222
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:39,968
Here.

223
00:17:44,473 --> 00:17:45,891
All right, what else?

224
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:51,021
Well, there's acting classes,
stage-combat classes, tap classes..

225
00:17:51,229 --> 00:17:54,149
Which we're still keeping
under our hats.

226
00:17:54,357 --> 00:17:58,820
That dialect coach who helped you
with a Southern accent.

227
00:17:58,987 --> 00:18:03,492
Which, after 20 hours of lessons,
still came out Jamaican.

228
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:09,915
What the hell are you talking about?
The South will rise again, man.

229
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:15,337
Yes, money well-spent.

230
00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:17,714
Okay, what else? Rent.

231
00:18:17,923 --> 00:18:22,594
Two, three years of rent,
utilities, food..

232
00:18:22,844 --> 00:18:27,349
Okay, so I'm writing you
a check for..

233
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:34,397
So you fell asleep during my movie.
Big deal, right?

234
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:36,775
How do you clear this thing?

235
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:43,949
Finish your enchilada.

236
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:48,078
Ross, we've tried all the spicy food.
It's not working.

237
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:51,623
Okay, here, have one of these peppers.

238
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:59,047
Oh, God. So hot. Oh, my God.

239
00:18:59,631 --> 00:19:04,970
By the way, you don't want to touch
the pepper and then touch your eye.

240
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,267
I am feeling nothing.

241
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,398
Speaking of hot,
watching you do that..

242
00:19:16,565 --> 00:19:20,277
really makes me want
to have sex with you.

243
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:24,239
-Stop it.
-Come on! Why are we wasting time?

244
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:28,952
We know it's gonna work.
It's doctor-recommended.

245
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm sorry. But we have to have
some boundaries. My God, I'm dying.

246
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,128
We've done it before.
We'll do it again.

247
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:41,506
It'll be a nice way
to bookend the pregnancy.

248
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:45,260
I'm not gonna make love to you
so you'll go into labor.

249
00:19:45,468 --> 00:19:47,971
Make love? What are you, a girl?

250
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:54,019
Always a great way to get
into a man's pants.

251
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:58,815
You'll be performing a service.
Think of me as a ketchup bottle.

252
00:19:58,982 --> 00:20:03,695
Sometimes, you have to bang on
the end of it to get it to come out.

253
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:08,033
I love when you talk dirty to me.

254
00:20:10,327 --> 00:20:13,246
I know it. You're right.
That's not sexy.

255
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,170
Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork.

256
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,922
Let me just bend over and get it.

257
00:20:30,347 --> 00:20:31,890
Oh, God!

258
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:38,396
Okay, enough.
This is not going to happen.

259
00:20:38,647 --> 00:20:41,232
Come on, Ross. I'm miserable here.

260
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:45,278
Come on, you started this,
now you finish it!

261
00:20:45,862 --> 00:20:48,782
Come on, wuss. Make love to me.

262
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,620
-You know what?
-What?

263
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,914
Forget it.

264
00:20:56,831 --> 00:21:00,126
What now, Ross,
you're not gonna talk?

265
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:04,047
How on earth will you ever annoy me?

266
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:07,384
Oh, wait a minute, I know.

267
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:14,808
You'd think the jalapeno would
clear up your sinuses, but no!

268
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:17,644
That's not enough..
What are you doing?

269
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:20,397
I'm getting that baby out of you!

270
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,322
-Oh, God!
-I know.

271
00:21:29,572 --> 00:21:31,700
Oh, no, no, no.

272
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:35,328
I think my water just broke.

273
00:21:35,912 --> 00:21:37,998
I am good!

274
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:44,129
Okay, I got the pillow.
I got the bag.

275
00:21:44,295 --> 00:21:47,048
-You got the keys?
-I got the keys.

276
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,972
We're having a baby.

277
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,323
I didn't have time to read this part
of the books, but do we have time..?

278
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:15,410
-Not so much.
-Okay, let's go.

279
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,291
-200.
-Thank you.

280
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:25,462
That's it. I don't care when
the baby comes. No more betting.

281
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:26,838
Okay.

282
00:22:28,673 --> 00:22:30,383
Hello?

283
00:22:37,849 --> 00:22:40,018
I guess we could bet
one more time.

284
00:22:41,436 --> 00:22:44,272
-Is Rachel having the baby?
-How did you know that?

285
00:22:46,191 --> 00:22:49,402
-Joey! Chandler!
-They're at the coffee house.

286
00:22:49,611 --> 00:22:52,072
You know everything!

287
00:22:52,322 --> 00:22:55,700
Wait. I bet you the baby
is over 7 pounds.

288
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:00,663
I bet you it has hair!
I bet you it's a girl.

289
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:04,584
-We know it's a girl.
-I'll give you really good odds.
