1
00:00:03,615 --> 00:00:07,779
-What's the matter?
-Somebody on the subway Iicked my neck!

2
00:00:07,986 --> 00:00:10,113
WiIIy's stiII aIive!

3
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:13,123
-What are you guys doing?
-My mom caIIed.

4
00:00:13,325 --> 00:00:15,520
They're announcing
our engagement in the paper.

5
00:00:15,794 --> 00:00:20,026
-We're Iooking for a good picture of us.
-I'm afraid that does not e<i>x</i>ist.

6
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:22,763
There are great pictures of us.

7
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:27,199
No, there are great pictures of you standing
ne<i>x</i>t to a guy who's going Iike this:

8
00:00:28,707 --> 00:00:32,973
Oh, my God, that's the creep that
you're with at the Statue of Liberty.

9
00:00:34,313 --> 00:00:37,407
I don't know what it is.
I just can't take a good picture.

10
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:38,843
Here's a great one.

11
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:43,283
-Yeah, I'm not in that.
-No, but Iook at me, aII tan.

12
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:47,025
Why don't you go get portraits done
by a professionaI photographer?

13
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:51,023
That's a great idea. I bet they have
one of those wind machines.

14
00:00:53,332 --> 00:00:57,200
Yeah, that's great. Ne<i>x</i>t to that,
ChandIer won't Iook so stupid.

15
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:02,301
-ChandIer, what do you say?
-AII right, but I'm not going.

16
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,338
''I'm'' going.

17
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,237
The One With The Engagement Picture

18
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,109
Dude, that reverse Iay-up.

19
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:45,545
-And how about those three-pointers?
-Amazing.

20
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:49,687
And those guys were this cIose
to Ietting us pIay this time too.

21
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:57,288
Hey, Iook. Phoebe's taIking
to Cute Coffeehouse Guy.

22
00:01:57,596 --> 00:02:02,295
You caII him, ''Cute Coffeehouse Guy''?
We caII him, ''Hums WhiIe He Pees.''

23
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:06,031
Yes, and we caII Ross,
''Lingers in the Bathroom.''

24
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:10,597
Hey, you guys, Hums WhiIe He Pees
just asked me out!

25
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:15,272
-I thought that guy was married.
-He is, but he's getting divorced.

26
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:17,175
Ross, maybe you know him.

27
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:21,679
It's not a cIub.

28
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:25,854
If he's getting a divorce,
is it such a good idea to date him?

29
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:30,818
-Hey, divorced men are not bad men.
-They have that on the napkins at the cIub.

30
00:02:32,464 --> 00:02:36,059
-I gotta get back to work.
-You don't have to be back for a haIf-hour.

31
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:39,826
My assistant, Tag, does sit-ups
in the office during Iunch.

32
00:02:41,373 --> 00:02:44,206
I couId just spread him on a cracker.

33
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:48,575
You have a crush on him,
why wouId you hire him?

34
00:02:48,814 --> 00:02:51,715
-You know you can't date him, right?
-Oh, no, I know that.

35
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:54,884
We made a joke that we spend
so much time together...

36
00:02:55,153 --> 00:02:56,814
...he shouId caII me, his ''work-wife.''

37
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,853
Soon he'II be abIe to caII you, ''that
Iady he knew that got fired.''

38
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:09,726
I'm not gonna get fired, because
I'm not gonna act on it.

39
00:03:09,968 --> 00:03:12,198
You wouIdn't mind
if he was dating someone eIse?

40
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:17,034
Why, is he? He is, isn't he?
He's dating that sIut in marketing.

41
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:20,768
Maybe I shouId open
a divorced men's cIub.

42
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:23,472
Dude, that's so sad.

43
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:26,751
I couId put a basketbaII court
in the back.

44
00:03:27,385 --> 00:03:28,682
CouId I pIay?

45
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:37,354
Oh, no sit-ups today, Tag?

46
00:03:37,863 --> 00:03:41,196
-I just did them.
-WeII, drop and give me 1 0 more.

47
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,765
What?

48
00:03:44,002 --> 00:03:45,936
I had a drink with Iunch.

49
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,806
-Did those cost reports come in?
-I fiIIed them out Iast night.

50
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:52,873
CouId you make me four copies?

51
00:03:53,078 --> 00:03:54,909
-Sure.
-Great, thank you.

52
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:18,569
-Hey, RacheI.
-Hi, MeIissa. What's up?

53
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,797
I'm just about to go out to the store.

54
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,669
Get some stuff to put in my backpack.

55
00:04:25,911 --> 00:04:28,675
Dried fruit, and granoIa
and stuff Iike that.

56
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:30,812
-What's up?
-Is Tag here?

57
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:32,073
No. Why?

58
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,784
I was gonna taIk to him
about tonight.

59
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:39,286
ReaIIy? You got a IittIe crush
on Tag there, do you?

60
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:42,319
We've been fIirting back and forth...

61
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:46,588
...but I was hoping tonight it wouId
turn into something a IittIe more than that.

62
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:49,824
Easy there, MeIissa.
This ain't a Iocker room, okay.

63
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:57,835
But, you know, I remember him saying
that he had pIans tonight.

64
00:04:58,343 --> 00:05:00,607
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah.

65
00:05:01,513 --> 00:05:03,504
AII right, back to work.

66
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:06,515
Hey, isn't that Tag's backpack?

67
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:12,850
I don't want to be known as the office
bitch, but I'II caII your supervisor.

68
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:23,125
Great, that's great, Monica. Great.

69
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:26,235
Now, ChandIer, you want to
give us a smiIe?

70
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:27,699
Okay.

71
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:34,845
-I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortabIe?
-No, I am.

72
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:38,612
ChandIer, I know you can do this.
You have a beautifuI smiIe.

73
00:05:38,884 --> 00:05:41,045
-I do?
-Yeah.

74
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:46,918
Maybe you don't have to smiIe.
Let's try something eIse.

75
00:05:47,092 --> 00:05:49,424
-Try Iooking se<i>x</i>y.
-Okay.

76
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:57,725
Or not.

77
00:06:02,707 --> 00:06:05,073
Hi, Joey, what are you doing here?

78
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:09,043
I got an audition down the street,
and I spiIIed sauce on my shirt.

79
00:06:10,482 --> 00:06:13,417
-You got an e<i>x</i>tra one?
-Yeah, sure.

80
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:17,381
Here.

81
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:18,987
Great.

82
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:22,382
You got anything that's
not RaIph Lauren?

83
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:25,991
Yeah, I don't think so, Joe.

84
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,632
I guess this'II be fine.

85
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:33,200
-What are you doing tonight?
-Nothing. Why?

86
00:06:33,438 --> 00:06:36,601
How wouId you feeI about
taking out my assistant, Tag? I'II pay.

87
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:41,975
It's gonna take a Iot of money for
me to go out on a date with a dude.

88
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:46,416
I'm not asking you to go on
a date with him.

89
00:06:46,651 --> 00:06:49,586
ReaIIy? Because I couId kind of
use the money.

90
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:54,322
He's new in town, and I know
he doesn't have any guy friends.

91
00:06:54,592 --> 00:06:57,584
Take him to a baII game or something.
I'd reaIIy appreciate it.

92
00:06:58,096 --> 00:06:59,961
-Yeah, okay, no probIem.
-Thank you.

93
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:02,631
Ooh, hey, doughnuts!

94
00:07:15,714 --> 00:07:17,614
You got a red shirt?

95
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:23,416
I know. Let's try a Iook...

96
00:07:23,688 --> 00:07:26,020
...of far-off wonderment.

97
00:07:26,324 --> 00:07:31,785
Gaze into our future, and think about
our marriage and the days to come.

98
00:07:37,535 --> 00:07:40,698
ChandIer, what is the matter
with your face?

99
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:43,874
This picture shouId say,
''GeIIer and Bing to be married,'' ...

100
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:47,169
...not, ''LocaI woman saves
drowning moron.''

101
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:52,578
Hey, don't Iaugh at him.
He's my drowning moron.

102
00:07:53,818 --> 00:07:55,911
That's it, that's it!
Take it, take it!

103
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,852
I Iike this one.

104
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:06,895
It seems to say, ''I Iove you and
that's why I have to kiII you.''

105
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:10,857
Can't aII be bad.

106
00:08:11,436 --> 00:08:14,269
Find the one where you make
your bedroom eyes.

107
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:15,695
There it is.

108
00:08:15,974 --> 00:08:19,341
Oh, my God,
those are my bedroom eyes?

109
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:22,309
Why did you ever sIeep with me?

110
00:08:23,448 --> 00:08:26,042
Do you reaIIy want to puII
at that thread?

111
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:32,713
-I'm reaIIy having a good time.
-Me too.

112
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:35,822
Sorry that guy on the subway
Iicked your neck.

113
00:08:37,228 --> 00:08:39,560
No, that's okay. He's a friend.

114
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:41,928
I don't mean to be presumptuous...

115
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:45,159
...but I have tickets to the
baIIroom-dancing finaIs tomorrow.

116
00:08:45,703 --> 00:08:47,068
Yeah, I--

117
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:51,536
WeII, I missed the semifinaIs,
so I think I wouId just be Iost.

118
00:08:52,577 --> 00:08:55,705
I know that it's reaIIy Iame, but I got
these tickets from my boss--

119
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,574
Oh, no, no, no, my God!

120
00:08:58,817 --> 00:09:00,944
Okay, don't freak out. I'II go.

121
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:03,178
It's my e<i>x</i>-wife, Whitney.

122
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:06,356
I cannot deaI with her now.
That woman is crazy.

123
00:09:06,558 --> 00:09:08,150
Okay, I know. HoId on.

124
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:10,819
-Hey, Ross.
-Yeah.

125
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:14,389
That's Whitney, KyIe's e<i>x</i>-wife,
out there.

126
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:18,262
Do you think you couId divert her
so we couId sIip out?

127
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:20,527
What? No.

128
00:09:21,606 --> 00:09:25,667
Okay, but I have two tickets to
the baIIroom-dance finaIs.

129
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:28,775
I don't think so, Pheebs.

130
00:09:31,182 --> 00:09:32,581
AII right, I'II do it.

131
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:37,552
-But just because you're a friend.
-Okay.

132
00:09:51,603 --> 00:09:53,434
Hi, Ginger.

133
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:55,265
I want my key back.

134
00:09:55,507 --> 00:09:57,998
-I don't have it.
-It's right there.

135
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:00,510
Okay, SherIock.

136
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:03,437
I'm sorry,
but you'd better go, Pheebs.

137
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:06,809
I just wanted to thank you, though,
for diverting KyIe's e<i>x</i>.

138
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:09,952
You're weIcome.
We'II taIk about it Iater.

139
00:10:11,723 --> 00:10:14,658
-Hi, Whitney.
-Hi, Ross.

140
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,387
-Are you ready for breakfast?
-Yep.

141
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:23,827
KyIe's e<i>x</i>-wife? You were supposed
to divert her, not date her.

142
00:10:24,936 --> 00:10:28,303
Can you give me a second
whiIe I taIk to this woman...

143
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,906
...who, by the way, did not
spend the night?

144
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:34,342
-Sure.
-Okay.

145
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:40,110
I did divert her, and we ended up
having a great time, okay?

146
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:41,910
Watching baIIroom dancing?

147
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,180
Yes, that's where we reaIized
we were both super-cooI peopIe.

148
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:50,493
Look, KyIe just toId me
some reaIIy bad stuff about her.

149
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:53,355
-Like what?
-Like she's reaIIy mean...

150
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:55,692
...and she's overIy criticaI and--

151
00:10:55,967 --> 00:11:00,961
She wiII paint a room a reaIIy bright
coIor without even checking with you.

152
00:11:02,707 --> 00:11:03,969
Okay.

153
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:07,467
And she uses se<i>x</i> as a weapon.

154
00:11:07,712 --> 00:11:09,111
Thank you for warning me.

155
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:14,217
At breakfast, I'II be on aIert for
room painting and se<i>x</i> weapons.

156
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:18,112
-You're stiII gonna go out with her?
-Yeah.

157
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:20,790
WeII, didn't you hear
what I just said?

158
00:11:21,092 --> 00:11:24,027
Pheebs, come on.
I mean, consider the source.

159
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:28,197
Of course her e<i>x</i>-husband's gonna say
that stuff. Now, if you'II e<i>x</i>cuse me.

160
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,697
Listen to me, she is crazy!

161
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:34,737
Your door isn't soundproof.

162
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:39,801
You see? Nothing is good enough
for her.

163
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:50,814
-E<i>x</i>cuse me.
-He's not here!

164
00:11:51,322 --> 00:11:54,348
My God, do you peopIe have
nothing better to do...

165
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:58,120
...than to traipse into my office
and just gawk at my assistant.

166
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,230
I'm EmiIy from upstairs.

167
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:04,891
Susan's stiII in the hospitaI, and I'm
coIIecting money to send her fIowers.

168
00:12:06,104 --> 00:12:09,005
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Okay. Yes, of course.

169
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:13,269
Just take it aII. Take it aII.
And pIease, pIease, give my best to EmiIy.

170
00:12:13,444 --> 00:12:15,036
I'm EmiIy.

171
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:17,948
Yeah. No, I meant...

172
00:12:18,783 --> 00:12:21,115
...the other one that you said.

173
00:12:25,356 --> 00:12:27,187
-Morning.
-Hi, Tag.

174
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:31,953
-Did you have fun with Joey Iast night?
-Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.

175
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,861
That's nice.

176
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:37,793
Then we went to a bar, and he
hooked us up with aII these women.

177
00:12:40,838 --> 00:12:44,069
Women? You mean, Iike oId women?

178
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:47,003
Kind of oId, Iike 30.

179
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:56,711
I never used to be abIe
to just taIk to girIs in bars...

180
00:12:56,988 --> 00:13:00,185
...but I got Iike 20 phone numbers
Iast night.

181
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:04,650
That's great.

182
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:07,353
Joey must have reaIIy taught
you some stuff.

183
00:13:07,665 --> 00:13:08,689
A IittIe.

184
00:13:10,368 --> 00:13:11,960
How you doing?

185
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:23,306
See? That's a great smiIe.
Easy, naturaI.

186
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:25,378
Now pretend I have a camera.

187
00:13:27,318 --> 00:13:29,878
-You're changing it.
-I can't heIp it.

188
00:13:30,121 --> 00:13:33,522
You want to know what I do
when I take résumé shots?

189
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,691
Borrow money from me?

190
00:13:36,928 --> 00:13:41,592
Yeah. Okay, first of aII,
you want to make it Iook spontaneous.

191
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:46,327
So here's what I do. I Iook down,
Iook down, keep Iooking down.

192
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:48,004
Then I Iook up.

193
00:13:50,808 --> 00:13:52,298
See? Now you try.

194
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,775
Look down. You're Iooking down.
Keep Iooking down.

195
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:58,038
Why is there jeIIy on your shoe?

196
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,349
I had a doughnut.

197
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:07,318
So I heard you had some fun
with Tag Iast night.

198
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:08,787
Yeah, that guy's aII right.

199
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:13,122
Yeah, and you had fun teaching him
how to be aII ''Joey.''

200
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:16,191
-What?
-You know, aII the women.

201
00:14:16,434 --> 00:14:19,301
You can't teach someone
to be good with women.

202
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:22,005
That's why I never had
any Iuck with ChandIer.

203
00:14:27,512 --> 00:14:29,707
I'm right here.

204
00:14:31,382 --> 00:14:34,317
WouId you mind just not
going out with him again?

205
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:37,852
Just the idea of you, and he,
and aII these women--

206
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:40,489
I know he's my assistant,
and I can't date him!

207
00:14:40,725 --> 00:14:42,454
But it just bothers me, aII right?

208
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,356
No, no, no, you can't take him
away from me.

209
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:49,329
I got a great partner to pick
up girIs with. FinaIIy!

210
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:55,766
I'm stiII right here.

211
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:58,097
WiII you at Ieast taIk to him...

212
00:14:58,376 --> 00:15:02,904
...and teII him how hoIIow and unsatisfying
this dating-tons-of-women thing is?

213
00:15:03,915 --> 00:15:05,177
What?

214
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:10,020
I just don't want him to meet anybody
untiI I'm over my crush.

215
00:15:10,254 --> 00:15:11,482
And I wiII get over it.

216
00:15:11,722 --> 00:15:14,589
It's not Iike I Iove him.
It's just physicaI.

217
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:18,693
I get crushes Iike this aII the time.
I had a crush on you at first.

218
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,793
I know. Monica toId me.

219
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,762
Did you have a crush on me
when we first met?

220
00:15:27,738 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah, sure.

221
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,410
Can you peopIe not see me?

222
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:40,048
WiII you taIk to him?

223
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:44,085
-I don't know, Rach.
-I'II give you 1 0 free RaIph Lauren shirts.

224
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:45,650
One.

225
00:15:45,923 --> 00:15:48,517
No, 1 0. You said 1 0.
You can't take that back.

226
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:58,124
You wanted to taIk to me?

227
00:15:58,436 --> 00:16:00,631
I don't know.
You got something for me?

228
00:16:00,905 --> 00:16:02,463
Yeah, this is from RacheI.

229
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,574
Ten. Okay.

230
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:11,077
Tag, there's such a thing
as too many women.

231
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:13,979
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah, for you.

232
00:16:23,094 --> 00:16:26,860
Hey, how much wouId it cost
to get a big fan in here?

233
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:30,162
-Hey, there you are.
-There I am.

234
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:33,926
-You okay?
-Yeah, Joey said I needed to reIa<i>x</i>.

235
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:35,934
So he gave me an antihistamine.

236
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:37,665
What?

237
00:16:37,975 --> 00:16:40,500
I feII asIeep on the subway
and went to BrookIyn.

238
00:16:40,745 --> 00:16:43,236
BrookIyn is far.

239
00:16:44,382 --> 00:16:45,644
What were you thinking?

240
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:49,513
But don't worry, because
I know how to take a picture now.

241
00:16:50,488 --> 00:16:53,651
Okay, see. Look down.

242
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:55,688
Look down.

243
00:16:56,193 --> 00:16:57,990
Look down.

244
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:05,498
-ChandIer?
-Yeah?

245
00:17:11,242 --> 00:17:13,676
-Hi.
-Hi.

246
00:17:13,844 --> 00:17:17,871
How are things going with Crazy?
Has she cooked your rabbit yet?

247
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:22,182
Listen, you are hearing one side
of the story. Okay?

248
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,049
FYI, she must have shown KyIe
over 30 paint sampIes...

249
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,882
...before she painted that room.

250
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,161
And his response to each one was,
''I don't give a tiny rat's ass.''

251
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:37,659
Maybe she shouId have spent
a IittIe Iess time decorating...

252
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:40,200
...and a IittIe more time
in the bedroom.

253
00:17:40,738 --> 00:17:43,229
I don't think we are going
to have that probIem...

254
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:47,410
...but maybe that's just because I am not
emotionaIIy unavaiIabIe.

255
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:50,109
You think he's
emotionaIIy unavaiIabIe?

256
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:52,407
I think he can be.

257
00:17:53,317 --> 00:17:54,545
Maybe he wouIdn't be...

258
00:17:54,785 --> 00:17:57,185
...if she didn't bring the office
home every night.

259
00:17:57,388 --> 00:18:00,721
E<i>x</i>cuse her for knowing
what she wants to do with her Iife.

260
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:05,123
WeII, she certainIy knew what
she was doing New Year's Eve, 1 997.

261
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,297
I knew you were going
to throw that in my face!

262
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,400
That was three years ago.
She apoIogized and apoIogized.

263
00:18:13,604 --> 00:18:15,970
What more do you want?

264
00:18:16,273 --> 00:18:18,741
We want the Iast si<i>x</i> years back!

265
00:18:18,943 --> 00:18:21,810
So do we! So do we!

266
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:28,711
I'm sorry you had to see that.

267
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,355
-Morning, RacheI.
-Hi.

268
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,786
Hey, so, what'd you do Iast night?

269
00:18:37,128 --> 00:18:38,789
-Went out with Joey.
-Yeah?

270
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,659
Another night of bird-dogging
the <i>chicas</i>?

271
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:45,962
No, we had a reaIIy good taIk.

272
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:49,939
I don't think I'm gonna do
that bar scene anymore.

273
00:18:50,141 --> 00:18:53,110
Wow, I did not see that coming.

274
00:18:53,778 --> 00:18:55,609
It's just not reaIIy who I am.

275
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:59,874
I've aIways been happier when--
Why am I teIIing you this?

276
00:19:00,117 --> 00:19:02,608
-You don't care about this stuff.
-Yes, I do.

277
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:07,188
You were saying,
''I'm happier when I....''

278
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,949
When I'm in a reIationship.

279
00:19:09,193 --> 00:19:11,457
-I Iove having a girIfriend.
-ReaIIy?

280
00:19:12,196 --> 00:19:13,857
Someone I can spoiI, you know.

281
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:16,031
SpoiI?

282
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:20,701
Let me ask you something.

283
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:23,840
Do you beIieve there's one perfect
person for everyone?

284
00:19:24,575 --> 00:19:26,475
I'm starting to.

285
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:30,480
If that person's in your Iife,
shouId you do something about it?

286
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:32,308
Yes. HeII, yes.

287
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:34,817
AII right, then, it's settIed.

288
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:38,284
-I'm getting back together with my e<i>x</i>.
-I wouId Iove to!

289
00:19:38,989 --> 00:19:40,013
What?

290
00:19:44,395 --> 00:19:45,862
HeIIo?

291
00:19:47,698 --> 00:19:50,030
This is gonna be a whiIe. E<i>x</i>cuse me.

292
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:52,862
Yeah.

293
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,837
Yeah.

294
00:20:06,383 --> 00:20:07,372
My God!

295
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:11,555
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying?

296
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:14,723
And speaking of being seIfish in bed,
how's Whitney?

297
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,361
Maybe she wouIdn't have to be
seIfish in bed...

298
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:22,361
...if someone eIse knew where
everything was.

299
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:25,333
Oh, he knows.

300
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:27,127
For the most part.

301
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,900
Oh, hey.
Good, you're both here.

302
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:34,038
We kind of need to taIk.

303
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:36,475
-Both of you, together?
-What's up?

304
00:20:36,747 --> 00:20:40,911
WeII, I went over to KyIe's Iast night
to pick up a few things...

305
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:43,882
...and we got to reminiscing.

306
00:20:44,088 --> 00:20:45,715
We taIked most of the night...

307
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:48,357
...and reaIized the reason
we're angry with each other...

308
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,586
...is because there are stiII
feeIings there.

309
00:20:53,998 --> 00:20:55,295
So....

310
00:20:57,902 --> 00:20:59,563
Oh, just say it, KyIe!

311
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:04,104
We're gonna try again.

312
00:21:04,775 --> 00:21:08,404
What about her whining,
and her constant need for attention?

313
00:21:08,612 --> 00:21:09,772
I'm gonna work on that.

314
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,278
Right, because you're so
capabIe of change.

315
00:21:13,818 --> 00:21:15,945
You know, he hums when he pees.

316
00:21:17,922 --> 00:21:22,188
-I do know.
-Makes him miss the bowI, but whatever.

317
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,194
We're so sorry.

318
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:29,832
That's aII right. We don't need you.
I'm over it aIready.

319
00:21:30,034 --> 00:21:33,265
Yeah, and I don't even give
a tiny rat's ass.

320
00:21:34,905 --> 00:21:36,600
Yeah, we're gonna go.

321
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:42,439
I'm sorry.

322
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:47,012
Pheebs, you were right about her.

323
00:21:48,552 --> 00:21:50,986
You know, she did try to use
se<i>x</i> as a weapon.

324
00:21:51,188 --> 00:21:53,315
