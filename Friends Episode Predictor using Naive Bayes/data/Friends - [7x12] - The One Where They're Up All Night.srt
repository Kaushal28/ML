1
00:00:03,982 --> 00:00:06,314
Ross, when's this comet thing start?

2
00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:10,352
WeII, technicaIIy, it started
7 biIIion years ago.

3
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:13,958
Okay. Fine, I'II stop.
No teaching, okay?

4
00:00:14,192 --> 00:00:17,992
We'II just watch the pretty Iight
streaking across the sky.

5
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:19,663
Okay?

6
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:24,534
Whose officiaI name is Bapstein-King.
Okay! Okay!

7
00:00:26,204 --> 00:00:29,537
There it is. Oh, Iook at that!

8
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:32,676
Isn't Mother Nature amazing?

9
00:00:34,646 --> 00:00:36,204
That's a pIane.

10
00:00:37,215 --> 00:00:41,049
WeII, aII right, 1 700 bags
of peanuts fIying that high...

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,049
...that's pretty amazing too.

12
00:00:45,257 --> 00:00:48,886
-I wonder if you can see my apartment.
-No, you can't.

13
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:52,653
-What?
-I don't know.

14
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,663
Man, Iook at aII those stars.

15
00:00:56,868 --> 00:01:02,033
Infinite space.
It reaIIy makes you wonder, doesn't it?

16
00:01:03,842 --> 00:01:06,140
-Know what eIse makes you wonder?
-What?

17
00:01:06,345 --> 00:01:08,939
Check out the rack on that chick.

18
00:01:13,085 --> 00:01:15,417
You think those babies are reaI?

19
00:01:19,558 --> 00:01:21,685
The One Where They're Up AII Night

20
00:01:57,596 --> 00:01:59,564
We've been out here for two hours...

21
00:01:59,798 --> 00:02:03,063
...and we haven't seen any
stupid comets. Can we go now?

22
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:06,566
I mean, ChandIer's getting chiIIy.

23
00:02:09,941 --> 00:02:11,806
No, I'm not.

24
00:02:13,245 --> 00:02:15,611
Then why are you wearing
Monica's jacket?

25
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:19,075
Because it's fIattering!

26
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:22,850
Come on, Monica. Come on, Monica.

27
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:27,416
-We're gonna take off too. Rented a movie.
-I won't say no to a movie.

28
00:02:27,626 --> 00:02:30,390
Oh, Pheebs, we just actuaIIy
wanted to be aIone.

29
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:32,756
-Get me out of here.
-Oh, okay.

30
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:37,625
-Hey, Ross.
-What?

31
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:39,530
-Check this out.
-Is it the comet?

32
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:43,835
No. Look, there's a bug
stuck in tar right here.

33
00:02:45,077 --> 00:02:46,101
I can't beIieve--

34
00:02:46,344 --> 00:02:48,835
I bring you here to see
the Bapstein-King comet...

35
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:51,572
...one of nature's
most spectacuIar phenomena...

36
00:02:51,783 --> 00:02:56,345
...and aII you care about are bugs
stuck in tar and some woman.

37
00:02:59,257 --> 00:03:01,919
You know, there's two women, dude.

38
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:04,861
Show me where.

39
00:03:05,864 --> 00:03:07,764
Okay. Right up here.

40
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,970
Joey, where's the pipe
that was hoIding the door open?

41
00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:18,437
I don't know.

42
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:28,643
Yeah, I do.

43
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,481
-Joey!
-What? Hey, don't Iook at me!

44
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:38,459
You wanted to come up here and Iook
for some stupid Burger King comet.

45
00:03:39,531 --> 00:03:42,523
It's caIIed the
Bapstein-King comet, okay?

46
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:46,259
Hey, Bapstein was a very
weII-respected astronomer from--

47
00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:48,104
No!

48
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,415
-Monica.
-She's sIeeping.

49
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:06,488
I know. Just a <i>q</i>uick <i>q</i>uestion.

50
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:11,025
Which one was <i>Deep Impact</i>
and which one was <i>Armageddon</i>?

51
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,666
<i>Deep Impact</i> was the one
with Robert DuvaII.

52
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:20,531
<i>Armageddon</i> is what's going
to happen to you if you wake me up.

53
00:04:21,306 --> 00:04:24,798
Sorry, I just can't sIeep.

54
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:33,745
Where's that book you're reading
with two women who are ice-skating...

55
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:36,510
...and wearing those hats
with the fIowers on it.

56
00:04:36,721 --> 00:04:39,815
Because every time I Iook
at that cover, I'm Iike--

57
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,186
It's in the Iiving room,
where there's aIso a Iight...

58
00:04:45,397 --> 00:04:47,558
...and no one wiII
kick you in the shin.

59
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:50,462
What?

60
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:06,079
PIease don't be a spaceship.
PIease don't be a spaceship.

61
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:15,687
Oh, thank God.

62
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:52,595
How couId you be beeping?
I just disconnected you!

63
00:05:52,797 --> 00:05:56,961
I took out your battery! How can--?
Don't interrupt me!

64
00:05:58,103 --> 00:06:01,163
RacheI! Monica!

65
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,031
Come on!

66
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:08,141
I can't beIieve this!

67
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:12,611
AII right, weII, I guess we know
what we have to do to get down.

68
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:14,978
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice.

69
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,085
HeIp us! PIease heIp us!

70
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:23,489
We're stuck up on the roof,
and we can't get down!

71
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:26,356
Ross.

72
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:30,563
I was thinking we'd just
go down the fire escape.

73
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,429
I know. I wasn't finished.

74
00:06:37,475 --> 00:06:39,705
But don't worry!

75
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:43,873
We're gonna go down the fire escape!

76
00:06:59,164 --> 00:07:03,464
I'm sorry, I thought I'd make some
warm miIk and it wouId heIp me sIeep.

77
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:04,999
With a wok?

78
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:09,399
Thought you were gonna read my book
to put you to sIeep?

79
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:12,007
It got interesting.

80
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,303
Damn you, Oprah!

81
00:07:15,413 --> 00:07:18,314
Here, Iet me make the miIk.
I'm up anyway.

82
00:07:18,516 --> 00:07:21,007
You know what we couId do
now that we're up?

83
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:23,983
We couId just taIk
to each other aII night Iong.

84
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:26,680
Like we did when we were first going out.
It'd be fun.

85
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:28,720
-Okay, that does sound fun.
-Yeah.

86
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,427
So how bummed were you
when the second sister died, huh?

87
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:34,564
The second sister dies?!

88
00:07:39,537 --> 00:07:40,902
No.

89
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:45,742
No, I was taIking
about the book I was reading.

90
00:07:45,944 --> 00:07:50,040
The second sister dies in
<i>Archie and Jughead Double Digest</i>?

91
00:07:52,217 --> 00:07:53,377
That's correct.

92
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:02,858
Want to go in the bedroom?
It's a IittIe more comfortabIe.

93
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:04,789
-Sure.
-Okay.

94
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:09,664
Oh, wait, did you send
those contracts to MiIan?

95
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:13,531
If this is your idea of se<i>x</i>y taIk....

96
00:08:14,506 --> 00:08:17,066
Did you overnight
the contracts I gave you?

97
00:08:17,242 --> 00:08:18,231
What contracts?

98
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,278
PIease teII me this is just one
of your jokes that I don't get.

99
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,606
Like what?

100
00:08:23,815 --> 00:08:26,875
Like the thing when you
put the phone in your pants?

101
00:08:28,653 --> 00:08:30,883
Tag, I'm serious.
This isn't funny.

102
00:08:31,122 --> 00:08:33,682
Those contracts had to go out today.

103
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:35,883
You didn't give me any contracts.

104
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:39,187
Yes, I did. I put a IittIe
Post-it on it that said:

105
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:43,265
''Must go out today,'' and I
underIined ''today'' three times.

106
00:08:43,468 --> 00:08:47,962
Then I put a IittIe heart in the corner
because I didn't wanna seem too bossy.

107
00:08:48,473 --> 00:08:50,304
You never gave them to me.

108
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:55,207
If we went to the office, you wouId see
those contracts sitting on your desk.

109
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:59,474
No, I'd see you Iooking embarrassed
because they are not on my desk.

110
00:08:59,684 --> 00:09:04,383
Maybe I'd Iook embarrassed because you're
taIking on the phone with your crotch.

111
00:09:05,423 --> 00:09:07,482
You want to go to the office now?

112
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:10,889
Come on, it's Iate.
We're not going down to the office.

113
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:14,896
Yeah, I understand. I wouIdn't
want to be proved wrong either.

114
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,361
AII right, get your coat!

115
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,597
Oh! When did you unhook this?
Nice work!

116
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:33,615
It won't go down any further.
It's stuck.

117
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,346
We're just gonna have to jump.

118
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:40,918
Now, we're gonna have
to make sure to Iand...

119
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:44,525
...to the right of that
patch of ice, okay?

120
00:09:44,762 --> 00:09:48,425
Not hit the dumpster
on the other side.

121
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:54,471
And try to avoid that weird
brownish-red stuff in the middIe.

122
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:58,232
So when you get down there...

123
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:05,114
...you go up to the roof
and you Iet me in.

124
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:08,709
-Wait a minute. I have to do it?
-You'II be fine.

125
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,582
It'II be just Iike
bungee jumping, you know?

126
00:10:11,789 --> 00:10:15,953
But instead of bouncing back up,
you won't.

127
00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:21,397
WeII, what if I smack
my head on the concrete?

128
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:25,126
WeII, I'm not gonna Iie to you, Joey.
It's a possibiIity.

129
00:10:28,273 --> 00:10:31,765
I don't know. TeII you what,
Iet's fIip to see who does it.

130
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:34,945
-You caII it in the air, aII right?
-Oh, aII right.

131
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,483
-Can you see what it is?
-No.

132
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:45,986
-Okay. WeII, you be carefuI.
-No, Ross, stop it.

133
00:10:46,257 --> 00:10:47,315
I'm not jumping.

134
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:51,655
Look, I have an audition tomorrow,
and I can't go if I break my Ieg.

135
00:10:51,896 --> 00:10:56,492
WeII, I'm not jumping. I have a son.
He won't have a father if I die.

136
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:58,601
So it Iooks Iike we're even.

137
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:06,638
Okay, so this wire...

138
00:11:06,945 --> 00:11:10,813
...is connected to this wire,
which pIugs into here.

139
00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:15,612
Okay, so to get the beeping to stop,
aII I have to do....

140
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:28,962
WeII done, Pheebs.

141
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:36,663
What do you want from me?!

142
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:43,170
Here's your miIk.
What do you wanna taIk about?

143
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:48,046
What? What? What?

144
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:52,713
Oh, were you sIeeping, sweetie?
I'm sorry. Here.

145
00:12:11,843 --> 00:12:13,834
<i>Oh, that's so much better. Okay.</i>

146
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:17,038
<i>At least I can hear myself think.</i>

147
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:35,194
<i>God, stop singing.</i>

148
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:37,163
<i>Stop singing!</i>

149
00:12:47,612 --> 00:12:49,102
Okay. FeeI free to Iook...

150
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,213
...but I'm teIIing you,
those contracts are not on this desk.

151
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:55,011
How couId you possibIy know?
Look at this mess, Tag.

152
00:12:55,219 --> 00:12:58,382
This is what I'm taIking about.
You have to be more organized.

153
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:02,548
You've got newspapers,
you've got magazines, you-- Oh!

154
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:05,495
And who's this chippy?

155
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:08,358
A IittIe young for you, but whatever.

156
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:09,692
That's my sister.

157
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:13,535
ReaIIy? Very cute braces.

158
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:17,636
Anyway, you know what?
The point is, Tag, start Iooking...

159
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:21,106
...because you're gonna find
those contracts on your desk.

160
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:26,747
So when do you imagine you gave
them to me? Morning or afternoon?

161
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:31,115
In the afternoon. Mr. ZeIner
came into my office after Iunch...

162
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:34,780
...he put them on my desk,
and then I put a Post-it on it...

163
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:37,886
...that said:

164
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:41,120
''Must go out today.''

165
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:45,968
So you just keep Iooking
in there, aII right?

166
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:57,212
They're not here.

167
00:13:58,483 --> 00:13:59,916
PuzzIer.

168
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:05,115
Bit of a puzzIe.

169
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:09,356
Why don't you check the copy room.
Maybe you Ieft the contracts in there.

170
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,427
-How couId I have Ieft them there?
-I don't know.

171
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,098
How can your genitaIs
make phone caIIs?

172
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:19,601
Okay? It's not a perfect worId.
Just go, pIease?

173
00:14:20,538 --> 00:14:22,438
-Fine.
-Thank you.

174
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,247
HeIIo?

175
00:14:41,592 --> 00:14:42,923
I stiII don't get it.

176
00:14:47,665 --> 00:14:49,326
You stiII awake?

177
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:51,564
Yeah. You?

178
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:55,606
You do know that was me
that just said that, right?

179
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:01,074
Hey.

180
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:03,109
As Iong as we're both up....

181
00:15:04,415 --> 00:15:05,780
Yeah?

182
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:11,948
I hope you're not thinking
about cIeaning the Iiving room.

183
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:20,192
Man, I'm starving. What the heII
was I thinking at dinner?

184
00:15:20,431 --> 00:15:23,958
''Do you want soup or saIad?''
Both, aIways order both.

185
00:15:26,137 --> 00:15:30,301
You know, I'm Iooking,
and I don't think anyone's home here.

186
00:15:30,508 --> 00:15:33,170
I say we just break the window...

187
00:15:33,377 --> 00:15:34,639
...crawI through...

188
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:37,212
...and you know, e<i>x</i>pIain Iater.

189
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:39,313
-No one's home?
-I don't think so.

190
00:15:39,517 --> 00:15:40,643
HeIIo?

191
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:50,225
So when you get in there....

192
00:15:57,301 --> 00:16:01,499
Okay. This is where
you and I part ways.

193
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:02,967
Noisy bitch!

194
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:10,508
Oh, what? What are you doing?

195
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:13,177
Do you know what just happened?

196
00:16:14,385 --> 00:16:18,185
Yeah. We had se<i>x</i>,
and then we feII asIeep.

197
00:16:20,157 --> 00:16:23,615
No. We were in the middIe of se<i>x</i>...

198
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:26,922
...and you feII asIeep.

199
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,362
No. No, that's not true.

200
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:33,831
No, best time ever.

201
00:16:35,506 --> 00:16:38,407
Yeah. You rock my worId.

202
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:43,203
-Monica?
-What?

203
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:47,009
I was giving you some of
my best moves, and you missed it.

204
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:51,745
So pIease wake up
so we can do it right.

205
00:16:53,157 --> 00:16:55,717
Okay. Okay. I'm ready.

206
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:58,018
-Come on, big feIIa.
-Okay.

207
00:16:58,229 --> 00:17:00,288
-Give me the good stuff.
-Yeah.

208
00:17:01,432 --> 00:17:05,095
No, no, no. Don't faII asIeep.

209
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,469
Okay, I'm going
to make you some coffee.

210
00:17:11,442 --> 00:17:15,742
WeII, I probabIy won't spiII coffee
grounds aII over the kitchen fIoor.

211
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,607
Okay, I'm up. I'm up.

212
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:24,081
Hi. I got you some coffee to--

213
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:26,583
So you got anything for me?

214
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,622
-StiII no Iuck.
-Oh, my God.

215
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:31,624
You checked your entire desk
and aII the drawers?

216
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:34,320
-Want me to check again?
-I wish you wouId.

217
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:38,264
WeII, no, it's not in there.

218
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:40,300
How about that drawer?

219
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:51,605
WeII, it's not out here.
Any chance it couId be in your office?

220
00:17:57,922 --> 00:17:59,514
I don't know.

221
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:02,417
I mean, Iet me check.

222
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:12,868
Any Iuck?

223
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:16,535
See you in my office for a minute?

224
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:21,342
You found them!

225
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:25,340
I'm not even gonna gIoat.

226
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:28,814
-I'm just reaIIy reIieved that this whoIe--
-You put these on my desk.

227
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,180
-I did not.
-Oh, reaIIy?

228
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:32,253
They sIid out of your bottom drawer...

229
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:35,357
...crawIed across the fIoor,
then jumped onto my desk?

230
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:38,323
How did you know
they were in my bottom drawer?

231
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:45,131
I am so hot for you right now.

232
00:18:58,082 --> 00:19:01,848
Oh, my God!
How did you get back here?

233
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:03,850
Phoebe Buffay?

234
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,021
Fire AIarm?

235
00:19:13,197 --> 00:19:16,997
Oh, hi, Officer Fireman.
Can I heIp you?

236
00:19:17,201 --> 00:19:19,101
We found your fire aIarm in the trash.

237
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:21,200
-That's not mine.
-Yes, it is.

238
00:19:21,472 --> 00:19:24,407
-How do you know?
-Ne<i>x</i>t time you dump a fire aIarm...

239
00:19:24,575 --> 00:19:28,671
...don't use a bIanket that says,
''Property of Phoebe Buffay, not Monica.''

240
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,375
Do you have a search warrant?

241
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:35,040
Because the Iast time I checked,
this was stiII America.

242
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:39,179
PIease reattach it.
It's iIIegaI to disconnect them.

243
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:43,451
Fine. But pIease, God, teII me
how to stop it from going off?

244
00:19:43,694 --> 00:19:45,252
Press the reset button.

245
00:19:45,463 --> 00:19:49,092
There's a reset button?
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

246
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,200
Oh. There's a reset button?

247
00:19:52,436 --> 00:19:54,427
My God!

248
00:19:54,705 --> 00:19:56,935
Why didn't I see that?

249
00:19:58,642 --> 00:20:01,236
Reset button. Reset button.

250
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:04,642
Where is there a reset button?
Oh, here it is! Oh!

251
00:20:20,931 --> 00:20:23,923
Fine, you Iive here.
The rent is due on the 1 5th.

252
00:20:29,006 --> 00:20:31,634
-Okay, you have a good grip?
-Yeah.

253
00:20:31,842 --> 00:20:34,675
I'm gonna start to cIimb down you now.

254
00:20:37,715 --> 00:20:39,649
-AII right, just hurry up.
-Okay.

255
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,286
Now, shouId I cIimb down your front

256
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:46,979
...or shouId I cIimb down

257
00:20:47,191 --> 00:20:48,954
...butt to face?

258
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:52,660
-Face to face.
-I Iike face to face.

259
00:20:53,397 --> 00:20:56,366
-Okay, here I come.
-AII right.

260
00:20:59,603 --> 00:21:02,333
Oh, my-- How much do you weigh, Ross?

261
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:08,467
I prefer not to answer. I'm stiII
carrying a IittIe hoIiday weight.

262
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:18,317
When we taIked about face to face...

263
00:21:18,522 --> 00:21:21,389
...I don't think we thought it
aII the way through.

264
00:21:22,026 --> 00:21:25,860
-What do you want me to do?
-Just shimmy down me and drop.

265
00:21:31,135 --> 00:21:32,659
-Hi.
-Hi.

266
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:38,034
You know, maybe I shouId hang,
and you shouId cIimb down me.

267
00:21:38,242 --> 00:21:41,837
Yeah? Maybe we shouId taIk
about that for a IittIe whiIe!

268
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,943
-It stiII Iooks pretty far.
-It's not that far. Just drop.

269
00:21:47,184 --> 00:21:48,913
Do not rush me!

270
00:21:56,927 --> 00:22:01,694
My pants are starting to come down,
and I'm not wearing any underwear.

271
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:09,762
My ankIe! I reaIIy hurt my ankIe!

272
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,532
I think I twisted it when--
A <i>q</i>uarter!

273
00:22:19,316 --> 00:22:21,750
That reaIIy was
some of your best work.

274
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,613
I toId you.

275
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,451
I can't beIieve it.

276
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:32,789
I've onIy got two hours
untiI I caII in sick for work.

277
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:35,289
I have to be up in seven minutes.

278
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:40,531
WeII, you're not gonna beIieve this,
but if you have seven minutes....

279
00:22:41,238 --> 00:22:42,796
ReaIIy?

280
00:22:43,307 --> 00:22:44,740
You want to?

281
00:22:44,942 --> 00:22:48,400
You get the vacuum cIeaner.
I'II get the furniture poIish.
