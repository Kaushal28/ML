1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:03,229
All right, no peeking.

2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:04,335
No peeking.

3
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:06,438
No peeking. No peeking!

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,508
All right, but you better be
wearing clothes when I open my eyes.

5
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:14,979
All right. Open your eyes!

6
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:22,854
Sweet mother of all
that is good and pure!

7
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,986
Days of our Lives
picked up my option!

8
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,659
-Congratulations!
-I know!

9
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:33,026
Now we can watch Green Acres
the way it was meant to be seen.

10
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,033
So which one is mine?

11
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:40,969
Whichever one you want, man.
Whichever one you want!

12
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,867
Not that one.

13
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:49,505
Oh, yes!

14
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:53,248
Oh, yeah! That's the stuff.

15
00:00:56,424 --> 00:00:57,857
Do we dare?

16
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,157
We dare.

17
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:07,492
The One Where Ross and Rachel...You Know

18
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:55,580
I can't believe two cows
made the ultimate sacrifice...

19
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,148
...so you could watch TV
with your feet up.

20
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:01,048
No, they were chair-shaped cows.

21
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:04,153
They never would have survived
in the wild.

22
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:08,858
This screen is amazing.
Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.

23
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:14,698
Rose Marie belongs on
a smaller screen, doesn't she?

24
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:16,868
Hi, you guys.

25
00:02:18,273 --> 00:02:19,740
Hey, you.

26
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:27,706
How was your day?

27
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:30,417
You know, pretty much the usual.

28
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,449
Sun shining, birds chirping.

29
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:33,779
Really? Mine too.

30
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:36,047
Hey, cool! Mine too!

31
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,251
I gotta get to the museum.

32
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:44,026
So I'll see you tonight?

33
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,065
Bye, guys!

34
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:55,871
Tonight?

35
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:01,104
-What's tonight?
-Our first official date.

36
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:03,213
Our first date.

37
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:05,910
Hello?

38
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:08,148
Hi.

39
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:12,792
You're supposed to waitress for me?
My catering thing?

40
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:16,555
-Any of that trigger anything?
-Oh, God, Monica. I forgot!

41
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:18,322
This is our first date.

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,592
-Yes, but my mom got me this job.
-I can be a waitress!

43
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:24,966
Thank you, thank you.
See? Phoebe! Phoebe!

44
00:03:25,173 --> 00:03:28,233
Really, Pheebs?
You'd have to be an actual waitress.

45
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:31,309
This can't be like your
"I can be a bear cub" thing.

46
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:34,271
I can be a waitress.
Okay, watch this.

47
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:36,746
Give me two number ones,
86 the bacon...

48
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:39,647
...one Adam and Eve on a raft
and wreck them!

49
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:54,992
It's James Bond!

50
00:03:57,238 --> 00:04:00,207
-Sorry we're late.
-That's okay. Come on in.

51
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:03,439
Is Monica Geller coming?
I was told she was.

52
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,576
Dr. Burke, it's me.

53
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,610
Monica?

54
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:09,406
My God! You used to be so....

55
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:13,018
I mean, you've
You must have lost like....

56
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:17,085
You look great.

57
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,188
Thank you.

58
00:04:18,393 --> 00:04:20,554
This is Phoebe.
She'll be helping me.

59
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:22,262
Nice to meet you.

60
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:30,135
-So how you been?
-Great. How have you been?

61
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:32,764
Obviously you know
Barbara and I split up...

62
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,975
...or you wouldn't do the head tilt.

63
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,541
The head tilt?

64
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:39,042
Since the divorce,
everybody asks how I am...

65
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,772
...with a sympathetic head tilt.
"How you doing? You okay?"

66
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:45,252
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,817
It's fine.
Believe me, I do it too.

68
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:51,924
I always answer with the
"I'm okay" head bob. "I'm okay."

69
00:04:52,494 --> 00:04:53,358
"You're sure?"

70
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,461
"Yeah, I'm fine."

71
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:58,223
I gotta set up the music.
I got a new CD changer.

72
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,129
Of course, the divorce only left
me with four CDs to change.

73
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,103
That's too bad.

74
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,300
I'll survive.

75
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:13,172
Two larges, extra cheese on both.

76
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:15,248
But listen...

77
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,010
...don't ring the buzzer for 19.

78
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:20,846
Ring 20. Geller/Greene.

79
00:05:21,256 --> 00:05:23,816
They'll let you in, okay?

80
00:05:26,294 --> 00:05:29,457
If you buzz our door,
there's no tip for you.

81
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:31,764
Okay, thanks.

82
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:37,167
Pizza's on the way.
I told you we wouldn't have to get up.

83
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:40,506
What if we have to pee?

84
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,941
I'll cancel the sodas.

85
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,285
Get back out there.
It's your party!

86
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,512
But they're so dull!
They're all ophthalmologists.

87
00:05:56,157 --> 00:05:57,454
You're an ophthalmologist.

88
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,957
Because my parents wanted me to be.
I wanted to be a sheriff.

89
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:06,289
That's funny.
Cadillac, cataract. I get it.

90
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,525
But you stay out there!

91
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:11,433
-You see?
-I tell you what.

92
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,474
I'll come get you in five minutes
with some sort of kebob emergency.

93
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:18,968
Better.

94
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,239
Oh, God, here we go.

95
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,349
Hey, want to see them go nuts?

96
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:25,184
Watch this.

97
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,745
Who needs glasses?

98
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:36,925
You are so smitten.

99
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:37,994
I am not!

100
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,131
Oh, you are so much
the smitten kitten.

101
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,933
-You should ask him out.
-Dr. Burke?

102
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:49,033
I don't think so.
I mean, like, he's a grownup.

103
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:53,780
So? You two are
totally into each other.

104
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:57,508
He's a friend of my parents.
He's like 20 years older than me.

105
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,879
So you're never gonna see him again?

106
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:02,122
Not never.

107
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:06,020
I'm gonna see him tomorrow
at my eye appointment.

108
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:10,489
-Didn't you just get your eyes checked?
-Yeah, but you know...

109
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:12,528
... 27 is...

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,991
...a dangerous eye age.

111
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:20,907
They are peeking teams to play my discreption, help me.

112
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:30,341
I'm not saying it was a bad movie.
I'm just saying it was a little...

113
00:07:30,578 --> 00:07:31,840
... hard to follow.

114
00:07:32,414 --> 00:07:34,314
I told you there'd be subtitles.

115
00:07:34,582 --> 00:07:35,571
I know.

116
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:40,744
I just didn't want to wear
my glasses on our first date.

117
00:07:48,963 --> 00:07:49,987
Monica?

118
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:57,660
It would help when I'm kissing
if you didn't shout my sister's name.

119
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,007
Honey, I'm just checking.

120
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:02,675
-Monica?
-Mon?

121
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,376
What?

122
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:37,636
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:41,006
It's just, when you moved
your hands down to my butt...

124
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:44,151
...it was, like, "Whoa!
Ross' hands are on my butt!"

125
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:48,719
And that's funny. Why?

126
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:51,649
Well, it's not.

127
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:54,190
I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just nervous.

128
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:56,386
I mean, it's you.

129
00:08:56,598 --> 00:08:58,156
You know, it's us.

130
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:02,096
We're crossing that line.
It's sort of a big thing.

131
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:06,706
Well, I know it's big.
I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.

132
00:09:18,286 --> 00:09:20,846
Okay, my hands were
nowhere near your butt.

133
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:22,755
I know, I know, I know!

134
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:26,085
I was thinking about when
they were there the last time.

135
00:09:26,361 --> 00:09:28,886
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Okay, look! I promise.

136
00:09:29,097 --> 00:09:32,089
I won't laugh anymore.
Put your hands back there.

137
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:34,597
No, see, now I can't.

138
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,231
-I feel self-conscious.
-Come on, touch my butt.

139
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,874
Just one cheek

140
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:44,106
The moment's gone.

141
00:09:44,342 --> 00:09:47,539
-I'll back up into your hands.
-That's romantic.

142
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:48,609
- Touch it.
-No.

143
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:50,712
-Oh, come on, squeeze it.
-No!

144
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:51,882
Rub it?

145
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,779
Oh, come on!
Would you just grab my ass?

146
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:05,728
Wow! Look at that!
The car is on fire...

147
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,990
...yet somehow
its expensive paint job...

148
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:12,499
...is protected by the Miracle Wax.

149
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,737
You've got a Cheeto
on your face, man.

150
00:10:27,986 --> 00:10:30,682
Aren't you supposed
to be out with Rachel?

151
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:33,253
That was 14 hours ago.

152
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:38,253
We gonna set a clock on this scene.

153
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:40,426
So how'd it go?

154
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:45,928
Have you ever been, you know,
fooling around with a girl...

155
00:10:46,432 --> 00:10:48,195
...and she started laughing?

156
00:10:50,603 --> 00:10:52,002
But it was 1982...

157
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:55,935
...and my Flock of Seagulls haircut
was tickling her chin.

158
00:10:59,112 --> 00:11:00,841
She laughed at you?

159
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:04,841
It could be worse, could be naked.

160
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:13,039
I've been wanting this
since ninth grade typing.

161
00:11:13,284 --> 00:11:16,276
And I just want it to be perfect...

162
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:18,484
...and right and....

163
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:22,553
Why isn't that laser beam
cutting through the paint?

164
00:11:23,294 --> 00:11:26,422
-It's the Miracle Wax!
-lt certainly is a miracle.

165
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,528
Hi, you guys.

166
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:33,401
Listen, I was thinking about....

167
00:11:33,637 --> 00:11:35,036
Can you guys speak up?

168
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:38,366
It's harder for us to hear you
when you lower your voice.

169
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:52,373
I'm sorry about last night.
I really want to make it up to you.

170
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:55,379
There's no need to make it up

171
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:56,413
How?

172
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:01,050
Well, I was thinking
maybe a romantic dinner...

173
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:04,129
...with candles and wine.

174
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:09,793
And then maybe going
back to my place...

175
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,629
...for dessert.

176
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:14,574
That sounds...

177
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:16,071
... perfect?

178
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:25,149
What's this?

179
00:12:25,486 --> 00:12:27,681
Would you get us a couple of beers?

180
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:35,629
I'm going to look into your eyes now.

181
00:12:35,864 --> 00:12:36,922
Really?

182
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:38,964
That's my job.

183
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:41,632
All right.

184
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:43,133
Look up.

185
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,461
Look down.

186
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:48,198
Now, open your eyes and look down.

187
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:49,970
That's right.

188
00:12:50,178 --> 00:12:52,043
Look into the light.

189
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,842
Now look at me.

190
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,228
Your eyes look good.
Those are good eyes.

191
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,692
Good. They feel good.

192
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:13,157
In my head.

193
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:21,300
-lt was great to see you.
-You too.

194
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:23,207
You too.

195
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,240
Goodbye.

196
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:32,750
Drops!

197
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:35,546
Here, they're free.

198
00:13:38,493 --> 00:13:39,551
Thanks.

199
00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:42,824
I better be going.

200
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,760
Yeah, I'll see you later.

201
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:46,330
Thanks again.

202
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:03,243
We have to get you lazy boys
out of these chairs.

203
00:14:06,955 --> 00:14:10,948
You should go outside and be with
the three-dimensional people.

204
00:14:11,526 --> 00:14:13,926
No. Inside good.

205
00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:17,595
Outside bad.

206
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:20,526
You guys are so pathetic.

207
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:22,258
Oh, Xanadu!

208
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:28,437
She's one of us now.

209
00:14:32,947 --> 00:14:35,609
We just wanted to stop by
and say good night.

210
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:37,216
Good night.

211
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,117
They won't even turn their heads.

212
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:43,256
All right, you guys.
I'm taking off my shirt.

213
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:50,926
She's lying.

214
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:56,603
Stop sending food to our apartment!

215
00:14:58,139 --> 00:14:59,470
Why are you dressed up?

216
00:14:59,674 --> 00:15:01,505
You're not the only one
with a date.

217
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,210
-What? You have a date? Who with?
-No one.

218
00:15:04,412 --> 00:15:05,811
Come on, what's his name?

219
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:07,146
Nothing.

220
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,280
Come on, tell me.

221
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,784
All right, but I'm very excited
about this, okay?

222
00:15:13,021 --> 00:15:16,013
So promise you won't get
big-brothery and judgmental.

223
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,587
I promise. What?

224
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:20,293
-It's Richard Burke.
-Who's Richard Burke?

225
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:21,859
Dr. Burke?

226
00:15:23,097 --> 00:15:26,260
You have a date with Dr. Burke?
Why? Why? Why...

227
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:28,969
...should that bother me?

228
00:15:29,203 --> 00:15:31,000
I love that man.
He's like a...

229
00:15:31,205 --> 00:15:33,503
...a brother to Dad.

230
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,203
-Here we go.
-I know, I think it's great that he looks like 50.

231
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:45,503
It's insperation to a man almost retired all over the world.

232
00:15:46,342 --> 00:15:51,279
He is the brightest, most sophisticated,
sexiest man I've ever been with.

233
00:15:51,514 --> 00:15:52,674
Dr. Burke is sexy?

234
00:15:52,882 --> 00:15:55,612
Oh, God! Absolutely!

235
00:15:57,486 --> 00:15:58,384
Damn!

236
00:15:58,988 --> 00:16:01,047
It's the museum again.
Can l?

237
00:16:02,558 --> 00:16:04,992
-Dr. Burke kissed me once.
-When?

238
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:09,324
When I was 7, I crashed my bike
right out in front of his house...

239
00:16:09,532 --> 00:16:13,229
...and to stop me from crying,
he kissed me right here.

240
00:16:13,536 --> 00:16:15,527
-Oh, you are so lucky!
-I know.

241
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:20,539
Australopithecus isn't supposed
to be in that display.

242
00:16:22,411 --> 00:16:26,871
No, Homo habilis was erect.
Australopithecus was never fully erect.

243
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,142
Well, maybe he was nervous.

244
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:38,725
Oh, look!
I can't believe this!

245
00:16:38,994 --> 00:16:43,090
Homo habilis can't use tools yet,
and they've got him with clay pots?

246
00:16:43,365 --> 00:16:45,890
Why don't they just
give him a microwave?

247
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,890
Clearly, they don't have a place to plug in.

248
00:16:55,803 --> 00:16:57,964
I'm sorry this is taking so long.

249
00:16:58,172 --> 00:17:01,198
It's longer than I expected.
We will have dinner.

250
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:02,374
That's okay.

251
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:04,042
Karl!

252
00:17:06,313 --> 00:17:07,940
Oh, God.

253
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:23,357
-Wow! Is that Michelle?
-Yep.

254
00:17:23,664 --> 00:17:26,189
I've not seen her since
high-school graduation.

255
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:29,402
Oh, my God, that night
she got so dru

256
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:33,169
Emotional.

257
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:35,875
You know, she's having another baby.

258
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:40,069
-I thought she just had one.
-No, no. Henry's almost 2.

259
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:43,805
And he's talking
and everything. Here.

260
00:17:44,551 --> 00:17:48,385
The other day he told me he liked me
better than his other grandpa.

261
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:51,922
In all fairness, his other
grandpa's a drunk, but still....

262
00:17:54,828 --> 00:17:56,523
You're a grandpa.

263
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:07,769
Are we nuts here?

264
00:18:08,342 --> 00:18:10,708
I don't know. Maybe.

265
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:15,076
I mean, I'm dating a man
whose pool I once peed in.

266
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:17,607
I didn't need to know that.

267
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:21,118
I guess 21 years is a lot.

268
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:26,355
I mean, hell, I'm a whole person
who can drink older than you.

269
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,271
So maybe we should just....

270
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:43,141
Maybe....

271
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:48,436
Wow.

272
00:18:51,251 --> 00:18:52,479
This really sucks.

273
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:55,118
Yeah, it sure does.

274
00:19:12,773 --> 00:19:16,004
We don't really have to decide
anything right now, do we?

275
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:18,905
No, there's no rush or anything.

276
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,472
-Pizza delivery!
-Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys!

277
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:29,520
I'm done.

278
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:33,350
Yeah, well, you know what?
So is Sorentino's.

279
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,025
I'm sorry.
Why don't we find someplace else?

280
00:19:37,264 --> 00:19:40,665
It's late. Everything will be closed.
We'll do it another night.

281
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:42,267
No, no, we won't.

282
00:19:42,502 --> 00:19:43,662
We won't?

283
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:45,800
Come on.

284
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,373
Okay, that's dead, right?

285
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,269
What are we doing?

286
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:56,004
-Do you want Cranapple or Cran-Grape?
-Grape.

287
00:19:58,318 --> 00:19:59,842
Okay, now...

288
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,212
...sit.

289
00:20:05,993 --> 00:20:08,188
Oh, my God!

290
00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:12,687
Billions of years ago,
Earth was only

291
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:15,725
Sorry.

292
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,906
So what are we looking at?

293
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:27,643
Well, you see that little cluster
of stars next to the big one?

294
00:20:27,881 --> 00:20:30,577
That is Ursa Major.

295
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:33,978
-Really?
-No idea. It could be.

296
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,658
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to work tonight.

297
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,891
Oh, that's okay.

298
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:43,992
You were worth the wait.

299
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:47,328
And I don't just mean tonight.

300
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,204
You're not laughing.

301
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,509
This time it's not so funny.

302
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:35,479
Oh, God!

303
00:21:37,217 --> 00:21:38,377
Honey?

304
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:40,643
That's okay.

305
00:21:41,221 --> 00:21:42,153
What?

306
00:21:43,223 --> 00:21:46,158
Oh, no. You just rolled
over the juice box.

307
00:21:54,568 --> 00:21:56,229
Thank God!

308
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:27,426
Hey, you.

309
00:22:33,774 --> 00:22:36,607
I can't believe I'm waking up
next to you.

310
00:22:37,044 --> 00:22:39,205
I know. It is pretty unbel

311
00:22:41,782 --> 00:22:43,682
We're not alone.

312
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:13,634
Is that the fire alarm?

313
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,346
It's not warm yet.
We still have time.

314
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:25,155
-Cool.
-Yeah, yeah. Cool!
