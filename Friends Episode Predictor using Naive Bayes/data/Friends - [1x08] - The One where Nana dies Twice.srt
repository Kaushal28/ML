1
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:08,971
Hey, gorgeous! How's it going?

2
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:12,508
Dehydrated Japanese noodles
under fluorescent lights.

3
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:14,680
Does it get better than this?

4
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:17,441
Question: Are you dating anyone?

5
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,650
I met somebody who would be
perfect for you.

6
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,282
Perfect might be a problem.

7
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:27,015
Had you said codependent
or self-destructive....

8
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:30,491
-You want a date Saturday?
-Yes, please.

9
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,125
He is cute.

10
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,527
-He's funny. He's
-He's a he?

11
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,134
Well, yeah.

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,995
Oh, God! I just

13
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,406
You' re nice Oh, God.

14
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:46,473
Good, Shelly. I' m gonna flush myself
down the toilet now.

15
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,839
Okay. Bye-bye.

16
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,243
The One Where Nana Dies Twice

17
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:41,366
It's hard to enjoy noodles
after that. Is that ridiculous?

18
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,535
Can you believe she actually
thought that?

19
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,601
Yeah.

20
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:52,133
When I first met you,
I thought maybe...

21
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,504
... possibly...

22
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:54,804
...you might be.

23
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:56,904
You did?

24
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,746
You spent Phoebe's birthday
party talking to my breasts...

25
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,785
...so I figured maybe not.

26
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:09,127
Did any of the rest of you guys
think that when you first met me?

27
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,126
-I did.
-I think so, yeah.

28
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,327
-Not me.
-No, no, me neither.

29
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:19,401
Although back in college,
Susan Saladore did.

30
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,196
You' re kidding.

31
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,734
-Did you tell her I wasn't?
-No.

32
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,571
I wanted to go out with her too.

33
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,113
I told her you were seeing
Bernie Spellman...

34
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,052
...who also liked her.

35
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,924
Well, this is fascinating.

36
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,424
So what is it about me?

37
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,395
I don't know.
You' re smart, you' re funny....

38
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,034
So is Ross.
Ever think that about him?

39
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,895
-Yeah, right!
-What is it?

40
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,170
I don't know. You just
You have a quality.

41
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,039
-Yes, exactly.
-Yeah, a quality.

42
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:06,776
"A quality. " Good. I was worried you
were gonna be vague about this.

43
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,489
I think this is gonna work for you.

44
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,851
-Excuse me?
-Sure, sure.

45
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:18,019
Women find you less threatening,
they let their guards down...

46
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,598
...you' re like a stealth heterosexual.

47
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:37,179
-It's Paolo calling from Rome.
-Oh, my God! Calling from Rome!

48
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,290
So he's calling from Rome.
I could do that.

49
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,450
Just gotta go to Rome.

50
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,032
Your Dad just beeped in.
Can you make it quick?

51
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,823
I'm talking to Rome.

52
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,329
I'm talking to Rome.

53
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,995
Hey, Dad. What's up?

54
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,235
Oh, God.

55
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,311
Ross, it's Nana.

56
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,752
-How you doing?
-Hey, Dad.

57
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,587
So how is she doing?

58
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,765
The doctor says
it's a matter of hours.

59
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,132
-How are you, Mom?
-Me? I' m fine, fine.

60
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,532
I' m glad you' re here.

61
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,709
-What's with your hair?
-What?

62
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,639
-What's different?
-Nothing.

63
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,273
Oh, maybe that's it.

64
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,144
-She's unbelievable. Her mother's
-Okay, relax.

65
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,617
We' re gonna be here a while.

66
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,019
We still have boyfriends
and your career to cover.

67
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,523
Oh, God!

68
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,770
The fuzzy little mints
at the bottom of her purse.

69
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,765
Yeah, they were gross.

70
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,405
You know what I love?

71
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,475
Her Sweet 'N Lows.

72
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,842
How she was always stealing them
from restaurants.

73
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,141
Not just from restaurants,
from our house.

74
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,908
Mrs. Geller?

75
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:27,991
She looks so small.

76
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,452
I know.

77
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:34,021
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop
and Aunt Phylis now.

78
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,030
Aunt Phylis is dead?

79
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,362
Yeah, for like six years.

80
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:43,108
Where were?
Can we focus, please?

81
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,276
Goodbye, Nana.

82
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,161
Bye, Nana.

83
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,360
Nurse!

84
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,202
What is going on?

85
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,703
You know how the nurse said
Nana had passed?

86
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,567
Well, she's not quite.

87
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,102
What?

88
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:25,011
She's not passed!
She's present! She's back!

89
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,510
What's going on?

90
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,413
She may have died.

91
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,552
She may have died?

92
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,518
We're looking into it.

93
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,583
I'll go see.

94
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,360
This almost never happens.

95
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,910
Now she's passed.

96
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,924
I just have to know, okay?

97
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:13,795
Is it my hair?

98
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,393
Yes, that's exactly what it is.
It's your hair.

99
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,798
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.

100
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,008
So did she...?

101
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,911
Twice.

102
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,750
-Twice?
-Oh, that sucks.

103
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,118
-You guys okay?
-I don't know. It's weird.

104
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:42,917
I know she's gone,
but I just don't feel....

105
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,127
Maybe she's not really gone.

106
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,889
No, no, she's gone.

107
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,098
We checked.

108
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,560
A lot.

109
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,805
No, I mean, maybe no one
ever really goes.

110
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,941
Ever since my mom died,
every now and then...

111
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:02,011
... I get this feeling that she's
right here, you know?

112
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,577
And Debbie, my friend
from junior high...

113
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,257
...got struck by lightning
on a miniature golf course.

114
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,692
I always get this strong
Debbie vibe...

115
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,396
...when I use a little yellow pencil.

116
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,732
-I miss her.
-Here, Pheebs.

117
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:27,995
Want this?

118
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,300
-Oh, thanks.
-Sure.

119
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,738
I just sharpened her this morning.

120
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,141
I don't believe any of that.
When you' re dead...

121
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,514
...you' re dead. You' re gone.
You' re worm food.

122
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,022
So Chandler looks gay, huh?

123
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,099
I don't know who this is,
but it's not Debbie.

124
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:03,140
Dad, let's just make a decision.

125
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:06,243
You're right.
It's going into the ground.

126
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:09,039
We should get the most basic thing.

127
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:14,242
"The non-protective corrugated
fiberboard with white laminate. "

128
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:18,120
Dad, we can't bury Nana
in a dresser from kea.

129
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,726
This is why your mother
buys my clothes.

130
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,897
I hate to shop. I hate it.

131
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,759
Isn't this more about
the fact that...

132
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:32,461
...once you decide, it's like
acknowledging Nana's actually gone?

133
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,897
No, I really hate to shop.

134
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:47,215
-I thought it'd be a closed casket.
-lt doesn't mean she can't look nice.

135
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,718
Sweetie, you think
you can get in there?

136
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,856
I don't see why not.

137
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,743
Here's my retainer.

138
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,353
I was just thinking...

139
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,661
-...when my time comes
-Dad.

140
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,090
Listen to me.

141
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,564
When my time comes,
I wanna be buried at sea.

142
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,297
You what?

143
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,235
I wanna be buried at sea.
It looks like fun.

144
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,877
Define "fun. "

145
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:53,211
Come on. You'll make a day of it.
You'll get a boat, pack a lunch....

146
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:57,852
And then we throw your body in
the water. Gee, that does sound fun.

147
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:02,994
Everyone thinks they know me.
Everyone says I'm so predictable.

148
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:07,962
Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say,
" Buried at sea? Huh? "

149
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,430
That's probably what they'll say.

150
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,566
I'd like that.

151
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,785
-Hey, gorgeous.
-Hey.

152
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,787
Look, l' m sorry about yesterday.

153
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:37,291
Don't worry. Apparently, other people
have made the same mistake.

154
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,293
Okay. Phew!

155
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,798
So, what do you think it is about me?

156
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,133
I don't know what.

157
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,240
You just have...

158
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,502
-...a quality.
-A quality. Great.

159
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,508
It's a shame. You and Lowell
would've made a great couple.

160
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,548
Lowell? Financial Services Lowell?
That's who you saw me with?

161
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:03,913
What? He's cute.

162
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,554
Well, yeah.

163
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,916
He's no Brian in Payroll.

164
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,988
Is Brian?

165
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,291
I don't know. If you
were gonna set me up...

166
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,766
... I'd like to think it'd be
with somebody like him.

167
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,472
Brian's a little out of your league.

168
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:30,548
Excuse me. You don't think
I could get a Brian?

169
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,784
Because I could get a Brian.
Believe you me.

170
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,981
I'm really not.

171
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,521
This one?

172
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,264
I've shown you every dress we have.

173
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:53,700
Unless you want her to spend eternity
in a lemon-yellow pantsuit...

174
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,032
...go with the burgundy.

175
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,008
Whatever we pick, she'd say
it's the wrong one.

176
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,509
Right. We'll go with the burgundy.

177
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,512
A fine choice. I'm coming out.

178
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,413
Wait! We need shoes.

179
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:19,293
-How about these?
-That's really a day shoe.

180
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,728
Where she's going
everyone else will be dressier?

181
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,596
Could we see something
in a slimmer heel?

182
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:35,509
I have nothing in an evening shoe
in the burgundy.

183
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,307
I can show you something
silver that may work.

184
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:45,016
-No, it really should be burgundy.
-Unless we go with a different dress.

185
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,225
No, no, no. Watch this.

186
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,690
Wait, I may have something
in the back.

187
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,770
Oh, my God.

188
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,938
Is everything all right?

189
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,975
Just Nana's stuff.

190
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,501
You guys ready?

191
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:33,669
Mom called to tell me
not to wear my hair up.

192
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:38,741
-Know my ears aren't my best feature?
-Some days it's all I can think about.

193
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,605
I' m sorry l' m late.
I couldn't find my bearings.

194
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,638
You mean your earrings?

195
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,445
What did I say?

196
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,012
-Are these the shoes?
-Yes. Paolo sent them from ltaly.

197
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:55,316
What? We don't have shoes here?

198
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:01,523
-Morning. We ready to go?
-Don't we look nice all dressed up?

199
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,597
It's stuff like that, isn't it?

200
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,580
-lt was a really beautiful service.
-lt really was.

201
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,019
Come here, sweetheart.

202
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,797
You know, I think it's time for you
to start using night cream.

203
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:39,960
What?

204
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:44,404
Nothing. Just that your coat
sounds like Brent Musberger.

205
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:50,643
-Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.
-You're watching football at a funeral?

206
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,647
No, it's the pre-game.
I' m gonna watch it at the reception.

207
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,454
You're a frightening, frightening man.

208
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,723
Oh, no! My new Paolo shoes!

209
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,791
I hope they're not ruined.

210
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,127
God, what a great day!

211
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,029
What? Weather-wise.

212
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,772
I know.

213
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,843
The air, the trees.

214
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:23,508
Even though Nana's gone,
there's something almost life

215
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,519
Ross, are you okay?

216
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,084
No, l' m fine.

217
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,847
Just...

218
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,615
... having my worst fear
realized, but....

219
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:45,930
I' m just checking to see
if the muscle's in spasm.

220
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,136
-What? What is it?
-You missed a belt loop.

221
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,505
Okay, it's in spasm.

222
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,777
Here, sweetie. I took these
when I had my gall thing accident.

223
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,643
Thanks, Mom.

224
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,688
Sorry.

225
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,121
Hi, l' m Andrea.

226
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,499
I'm Dorothy's daughter.

227
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:19,295
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have
no idea who Dorothy is.

228
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,332
Look who's up!

229
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:28,611
-How do you feel?
-I feel great.

230
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,481
I feel great. I feel great.

231
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,045
Wow, those pills really worked.

232
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:39,323
Yeah. Not the first two,
but the second two....

233
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,557
I love you guys.

234
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:49,635
You guys are the greatest.
I love my sister.

235
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,064
I love Pheebs.

236
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,237
That's so nice.

237
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,066
I love you, man.

238
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:03,005
And listen,
if you wanna be gay, be gay!

239
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,447
It doesn't matter to me.

240
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:10,211
You were right.

241
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,364
I do love you.

242
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:29,165
Oh, Ross. I love you too.

243
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,503
Oh, no, I really love you.

244
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,648
I really love you.

245
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,252
Oh, you don't get it!

246
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:51,392
-What do you got there?
-Just a hearing disability.

247
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:53,827
What's the score?

248
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:58,162
1 7-1 4, Giants.
Three minutes to go in the third.

249
00:18:58,371 --> 00:18:59,395
Beautiful!

250
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:11,806
Pheebs, could you maybe
hand me a cracker?

251
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,788
Your grandmother would've hated this.

252
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:20,358
Sure. What with it being
her funeral and all.

253
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,927
No, I'd be hearing about...

254
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,860
...why didn't I get
the honey-glazed ham.

255
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:31,695
Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.
Or she'd say:

256
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:35,341
"Why waste your money?
I don't need flowers, l' m dead. "

257
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,871
That sounds like Nana.

258
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,904
Do you know what it's like
to grow up...

259
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:46,883
...with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?

260
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:50,749
I can imagine.

261
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,824
It's a wonder your mother
turned out...

262
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:58,689
...to be the positive,
life-affirming person she is.

263
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,990
That is a wonder.

264
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:09,404
So tell me something, Mom.
If you had to do it all over again...

265
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,668
... I mean, if she was here
right now...

266
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:14,874
...would you tell her?

267
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,103
T ell her what?

268
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:21,954
How she drove you crazy,
picking on every little detail.

269
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,253
Like your hair, for example.

270
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:28,754
I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at.

271
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:34,329
Would things have been better
if you'd just told her the truth?

272
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,038
Some things are better left unsaid.

273
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,142
It's nicer when people just get along.

274
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,342
More wine?

275
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,378
Oh, I think so.

276
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:04,391
Those earrings look
really lovely on you.

277
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:07,793
Thank you.

278
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:09,894
They're yours.

279
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,896
Actually, they were Nana's.

280
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,306
Now l' m depressed!

281
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,013
Even more than I was.

282
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,284
Oh, look. My first grade picture.

283
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:39,260
Please ignore the Dy-no-mite T -shirt.

284
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:43,934
-Hey, who's this little naked guy?
-That little naked guy would be me.

285
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,333
Look at the little thing!

286
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,771
Yes, fine.
That is my penis.

287
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:55,344
Can we be grownups now?

288
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:57,481
Who are those people?

289
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,481
-Got me.
-That's Nana right there in the middle.

290
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:03,715
Yeah, let's see.

291
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,653
" Me and the gang at Java Joe's. "

292
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:10,420
You look just like your grandmother.
How old was she?

293
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,664
Let's see, " 1 939. "

294
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,891
Twenty-four, twenty-five.

295
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,964
It looks like a fun gang.

296
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:26,939
Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked!

297
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,670
Let me see!

298
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:33,181
No, no. That would be me again.

299
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,389
I'm just trying something.

300
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:51,892
Hey, Lowell.

301
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:53,500
Oh, hey, Chandler.

302
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,233
So how's it going in
Financial Services?

303
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,877
It's like Mardi Gras without
the papier-mache heads.

304
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:03,173
How about you?

305
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,351
Good. Good. Listen...

306
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,348
...I don't know what Shelly told you
about me, but...

307
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:12,856
... I' m not.

308
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:16,188
I know. That's what I told her.

309
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:17,856
Really?

310
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,961
So you can tell?

311
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:27,135
Pretty much. Most of the time.
We have a kind of radar.

312
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,975
So you don't think I have...

313
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:32,439
...a quality?

314
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:36,814
Speaking for my people,
I'd have to say no.

315
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:42,684
By the way, your friend Brian,
from Payroll? He is.

316
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:46,484
-He is?
-And way out of your league.

317
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:51,561
Out of my league!

318
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:56,167
I could get a Brian. If I wanted to
get a Brian, I could get a Brian.

319
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,265
Hey, Brian.
