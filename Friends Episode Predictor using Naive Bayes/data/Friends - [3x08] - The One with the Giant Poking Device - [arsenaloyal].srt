1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,704
Here you go, Pheebs.

2
00:00:03,882 --> 00:00:06,442
Who else wants one of my
special home-baked brownies?

3
00:00:06,618 --> 00:00:08,643
-l will have one.
-l do.

4
00:00:10,122 --> 00:00:12,215
-That's okay.
-l'm not having one.

5
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:14,882
No, no. lt's just my tooth.

6
00:00:15,127 --> 00:00:16,992
-All right.
-l'll have one.

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,698
So you need a dentist?
l've got a good one.

8
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:25,200
Thanks. l have a good one too.
l just can't see him.

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,601
See, that is the problem
with invisible dentists.

10
00:00:28,774 --> 00:00:34,542
lt's very unsettling to see all those
metal tools just flying around.

11
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:37,577
Why can't you go to him?

12
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:42,652
Because every time l go
to the dentist, somebody dies.

13
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:46,822
That is so weird.
Every time l go to the dentist...

14
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:49,186
...l look down the hygienist's blouse.

15
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:52,529
Phoebe, what...?

16
00:00:52,698 --> 00:00:53,722
What?

17
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:55,658
First, it was my Aunt Mary.

18
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:58,300
And then there was John,
my mailman.

19
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:01,198
And then my cowboy friend,
Albino Bob.

20
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:04,602
And all these people actually died?

21
00:01:04,776 --> 00:01:06,937
Yes. While l was in the chair.

22
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:09,342
That's why l take such
good care of my teeth.

23
00:01:09,514 --> 00:01:12,608
lt's not about oral hygiene.
l floss to save lives.

24
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,553
Come on, you didn't kill anybody.

25
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:19,418
These people just happened to die
when you went to the dentist.

26
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:21,081
lt's just a coincidence.

27
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:25,593
Tell that to them.
Oh, you can't! They're dead!

28
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:29,059
The One With the Giant Poking Device

29
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:15,112
Thanks, Gunther.

30
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:17,773
Can l get a napkin too?

31
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:20,577
Like you don't already
have everything.

32
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:29,621
You're in pain. Would you just
go to the dentist. Just go.

33
00:02:29,795 --> 00:02:31,956
Fine. But if you're my next victim...

34
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,361
...don't come back as a poltergeist
who sucks me into the TV set.

35
00:02:36,268 --> 00:02:37,257
l promise.

36
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:40,667
Although, don't feel
like you can't visit.

37
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:44,307
Hey, is Chandler here?

38
00:02:45,777 --> 00:02:48,211
No. No, he's not.

39
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,513
You guys, Joey just saw
Janice kissing her ex-husband.

40
00:02:53,685 --> 00:02:54,743
What?

41
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,946
What are you gonna do?
How are you gonna tell Chandler?

42
00:02:58,156 --> 00:03:01,421
l was thinking about that.
l think the best way would be...

43
00:03:01,593 --> 00:03:02,582
...to not.

44
00:03:03,562 --> 00:03:06,759
You can't keep this to yourself.
lf you know, you have to tell him.

45
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:09,196
lt'll kill him.
lt'll just kill him.

46
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:12,268
Wait until l go to the dentist.
Maybe l'll kill him.

47
00:03:17,843 --> 00:03:23,008
Ugly Naked Guy's using his new
hammock. lt's like a Play-Doh fat factory.

48
00:03:23,815 --> 00:03:25,942
l'm going to the dentist.
So listen...

49
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:30,418
...just be on the lookout for anything
that you could fall into...

50
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:33,183
...or that can fall on you...

51
00:03:33,358 --> 00:03:34,655
...or....

52
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:36,293
Or just look out!

53
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:40,323
And l also just want to....

54
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:43,627
l just want to tell you all that....

55
00:03:48,907 --> 00:03:52,172
Okay. l have a problem. l have
to go into work for a few hours.

56
00:03:52,344 --> 00:03:55,142
Some kids messed up
the Homo sapien display.

57
00:03:55,313 --> 00:03:56,302
What did they do?

58
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:59,575
They painted over the word
''sapien,'' for one thing.

59
00:04:00,552 --> 00:04:05,353
Then they rearranged the figures.
Let's just leave it at that.

60
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:07,848
Do you want me
to watch Ben for you?

61
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:10,051
That's what l was gonna ask.
Thank you.

62
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:12,253
Wait, hello!
What about me?

63
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,888
You? You want to watch Ben.

64
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:22,638
That would be great!
l just asked Monica...

65
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:25,140
...because l know how empty
her life is.

66
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:32,241
l got a science question.

67
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:38,879
lf the Homo sapiens were,
in fact, ''homo'' sapiens...

68
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:42,790
...is that why they're extinct?

69
00:04:44,963 --> 00:04:48,194
Joey, Homo sapiens are people.

70
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:51,426
Hey, l'm not judging.

71
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:55,105
Look, Benny. Spoon!

72
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:57,400
Spoon!

73
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:01,777
Come on. All right, you know what?
l think he's bored.

74
00:05:01,947 --> 00:05:04,279
Here. You wanna play
the airplane game?

75
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:06,349
You wanna show Rachel?
Come here.

76
00:05:06,518 --> 00:05:08,850
You wanna do something fun?
Okay.

77
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:23,091
Who's so brave?
You're so brave! Yes, you are.

78
00:05:23,268 --> 00:05:25,168
-You're so brave.
-You're okay.

79
00:05:25,337 --> 00:05:27,601
He's fine.
Let's just put him down.

80
00:05:27,772 --> 00:05:30,605
Come here, babe.
Yes, you're such a good boy.

81
00:05:30,842 --> 00:05:35,074
How could you do that to him?
Ross trusted me! What's he gonna say?

82
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,305
Nothing, because we're not
telling him.

83
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:38,641
-We're not?
-No.

84
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:41,149
All right, l like that.

85
00:05:41,586 --> 00:05:43,884
So we're okay.
We're okay, aren't we?

86
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:46,285
No, we're not okay.
There's a bump.

87
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,618
What bump?

88
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:50,352
Oh, my God! Well, push it in!
Push it in!

89
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:53,326
l cannot push it in!

90
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:56,192
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.

91
00:05:56,368 --> 00:05:57,699
-That's it.
-Okay.

92
00:05:57,869 --> 00:05:59,063
-l got it!
-Okay.

93
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:00,898
The second Ross walks in...

94
00:06:01,072 --> 00:06:03,939
...take him to your bedroom,
and do whatever it is you do...

95
00:06:04,109 --> 00:06:05,872
...that makes him go....

96
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:09,507
Or...

97
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,850
...we could put a hat on his head.

98
00:06:13,018 --> 00:06:17,853
A hat! Yes! We need a hat! Where
are we gonna find a tiny little hat?

99
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:19,615
l'll get Rainy Day Bear!

100
00:06:19,824 --> 00:06:22,190
Because he'll know what to do?

101
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:24,222
Oh, my God.
You're a genius!

102
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:26,192
lt's kind of sewn on.

103
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:27,831
-Give it. Give it.
-Okay.

104
00:06:32,504 --> 00:06:35,940
lt's just like a bloodbath
in here today!

105
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:43,441
Hey, hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

106
00:06:44,716 --> 00:06:47,184
Do you think these pearls are nice?

107
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:49,149
l'd prefer a mountain bike.

108
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:54,424
Janice's birthday is coming up.
l wanna get her something special.

109
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:57,386
-Come in here with me.
-Wait!

110
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:02,331
You wanna get her something special?
Get her flowers.

111
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,264
Get her candy. Get her gum.
Girls love gum.

112
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:09,466
That's a good idea. ''Dear Janice:
Have a Hubba Bubba birthday.''

113
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,435
l would like to get her
something serious.

114
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:15,772
You want something serious.

115
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:19,246
You know what you should do?
You should get her one of those...

116
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,941
...barium enemas.

117
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:25,645
Those are dead serious.

118
00:07:25,824 --> 00:07:28,850
And you know she'll never
get one for herself.

119
00:07:29,894 --> 00:07:33,660
Look, l'm gonna go in here.
And you don't buy me anything, ever!

120
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:36,596
You can't! You can't.
You can't buy her pearls.

121
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:39,032
You just can't. You can't,
You can't, you can't!

122
00:07:39,204 --> 00:07:41,104
Why not?

123
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,101
Oh, God.

124
00:07:45,543 --> 00:07:47,374
Here's the thing.

125
00:07:48,113 --> 00:07:50,240
This is the thing.
Okay, the thing is--

126
00:07:50,415 --> 00:07:51,507
What is the thing?

127
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:56,449
l went down to the
Mattress King's showroom...

128
00:07:56,654 --> 00:07:59,589
...and l saw Janice kissing
her ex-husband.

129
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:02,824
What?

130
00:08:02,994 --> 00:08:05,929
They were in his office.

131
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:10,868
She wouldn't do that.
She's with me.

132
00:08:11,036 --> 00:08:12,697
l'm telling you, l saw it.

133
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:14,805
Well, you're wrong.
You're wrong.

134
00:08:14,973 --> 00:08:16,531
l'm not wrong.

135
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,302
l wish l was.

136
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:22,873
l'm sorry.

137
00:08:26,284 --> 00:08:28,946
Bet that barium enema
doesn't sound so bad now.

138
00:08:31,723 --> 00:08:36,558
lt makes more sense as an ensemble.
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.

139
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:40,422
Oh! You're alive!
You're alive!

140
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:44,360
l promised you no one
would die, didn't l?

141
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:48,028
We'll see about that. Can l use your
phone to call everyone l know?

142
00:08:48,206 --> 00:08:51,232
Sure. We have no money.
Go ahead.

143
00:08:52,243 --> 00:08:55,770
Hey, you're not dead!
Okay, see you.

144
00:08:57,682 --> 00:08:59,479
Monica.

145
00:08:59,684 --> 00:09:02,152
Oh, my God!
He just said my name!

146
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,151
-Did you hear that?
-Yeah.

147
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:07,324
Monica bang!

148
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:12,361
Okay, l heard that.

149
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,657
Did he just say, ''Monica bang''?

150
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:18,232
Oh, my God!
He's gonna rat me out!

151
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:21,099
Monica bang!

152
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:24,839
Sweetie, you need to stop
saying that now.

153
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:27,569
lt's no big deal.
lt's not even worth mentioning.

154
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:29,838
You see? We all do it all the time.

155
00:09:30,048 --> 00:09:31,447
See? Watch this.

156
00:09:33,384 --> 00:09:36,251
Monica bang!
Everybody bang!

157
00:09:36,554 --> 00:09:37,578
Ben bang!

158
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:39,188
Rachel bang!

159
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:41,750
Bang, Rachel! Bang!

160
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,728
-lsn't it fun?
-Look at that!

161
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:46,754
We all do it!

162
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:49,661
-Okay, l'm stopping now.
-Are you okay?

163
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:53,497
Yeah. You know, if it's not
a headboard, it's just not worth it.

164
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:06,880
How's my Bing-a-ling?

165
00:10:10,722 --> 00:10:12,212
l don't know.

166
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,789
You tell me.

167
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:17,419
Anything you want to tell me?

168
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:19,825
Because if you....
You should--

169
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:22,125
You would tell me.

170
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:26,602
Why are your eyes so wide?

171
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:29,263
You tell me.

172
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,068
Maybe it's because l was just
fooling around with my ex.

173
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:34,677
Oh, no. That was you!

174
00:10:34,913 --> 00:10:36,471
Oh, my God!

175
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:38,275
-All right!
-How did you know?

176
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:40,576
Joey told me.
He saw you two kissing.

177
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:42,777
ln the park?

178
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:46,254
No. ln his office.
How many kisses were there?

179
00:10:46,424 --> 00:10:49,222
-Just those two!
-Why? Why? Why?

180
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:52,124
Why was there kissing?
There should be no kissing!

181
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:55,562
l'm sorry, honey.
l'm so, so....

182
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:58,361
l'm so, so sorry. l just....

183
00:11:00,405 --> 00:11:03,135
What happened was l....
l can't breathe.

184
00:11:03,675 --> 00:11:07,076
Can you get me a bag or something?

185
00:11:07,245 --> 00:11:10,305
Here. Here. Here.

186
00:11:13,484 --> 00:11:15,452
-lt's the receipt.
-l'll take it.

187
00:11:17,322 --> 00:11:19,586
Look, l've got to know.

188
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:24,626
Are you finished with me?

189
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,961
Are you finished with him?

190
00:11:32,103 --> 00:11:34,571
Do you still love him?

191
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:39,937
Do you still love me?

192
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:42,043
All right, look...

193
00:11:43,114 --> 00:11:45,742
...l'm gonna need an actual
answer here, okay?

194
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:47,976
So which is it?

195
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,610
Him or me?

196
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:01,824
l don't know.

197
00:12:03,835 --> 00:12:07,896
Okay, if you're alive,
you answer your phone!

198
00:12:13,878 --> 00:12:18,281
Okay, Ben, l won't tell your daddy
that you had ice cream before dinner...

199
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:22,249
...if you won't tell him about
our little bonking incident.

200
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,821
Number one, l don't think Ben
understands the concept of bribery.

201
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,618
And number two, l--

202
00:12:30,228 --> 00:12:33,595
-What?
-You said, ''number two.''

203
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,660
l also said, ''number one.''

204
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:41,031
l know.

205
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:43,904
-Hey, everyone.
-Hi!

206
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:46,066
How's my little boy?

207
00:12:46,244 --> 00:12:48,144
He's perfect.
Aren't you, Ben?

208
00:12:48,313 --> 00:12:52,374
-He's never been better.
-What did you do, take him whaling?

209
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:55,351
Monica.

210
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,253
Oh, my God! He just said your name!
That's great! Good job, Ben!

211
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:02,689
Monica bang!

212
00:13:03,127 --> 00:13:07,621
That's right. That's what
l'd sound like if l exploded.

213
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:12,130
The curse is broken!
l called everybody l know...

214
00:13:12,303 --> 00:13:14,464
...and everyone is alive!

215
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:22,735
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.

216
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:29,915
My God, l killed another one!

217
00:13:30,088 --> 00:13:34,149
The curse is getting stronger too,
to bring down something that big.

218
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:36,421
Maybe he's just taking a nap.

219
00:13:36,594 --> 00:13:39,358
l'm telling you,
he hasn't moved since this morning.

220
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,963
We should call somebody.

221
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:44,363
And tell them what? The naked guy
we stare at isn't moving?

222
00:13:44,535 --> 00:13:46,833
We've got to find out if he's alive.

223
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:49,495
How are we gonna do that?
There's no way.

224
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:51,403
Well, there is one way.

225
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:54,374
His window's open.
l say...

226
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:56,911
...we poke him.

227
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:04,280
You know how we save
all those chopsticks...

228
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:07,151
...for no reason
when we get Chinese food?

229
00:14:08,326 --> 00:14:10,988
Well, now we got a reason.

230
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:12,655
What?

231
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,799
We're fashioning a very long
poking device.

232
00:14:17,668 --> 00:14:19,135
All right.

233
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:23,536
Hey, what's the matter?

234
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:28,468
l talked to Janice.

235
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:31,672
Oh, my God.
ls she going back to him?

236
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:33,612
She doesn't know.

237
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:36,253
Says she loves us both.

238
00:14:36,954 --> 00:14:39,787
l woke up this morning,
l was in love.

239
00:14:39,957 --> 00:14:42,482
l was happy!

240
00:14:43,327 --> 00:14:46,057
lt serves me right for buying
that 1 2-pack of condoms.

241
00:14:48,332 --> 00:14:52,598
And now l can't even return them,
because she choked on the receipt!

242
00:14:55,306 --> 00:14:58,867
What are you gonna do?

243
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:02,276
l don't know.

244
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,177
You know? What would you do?

245
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:11,213
-lt doesn't matter what l'd do.
-Come on. Come on. Tell me.

246
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,616
All right, you're....

247
00:15:17,028 --> 00:15:20,589
You're probably not gonna
want to hear this...

248
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:25,929
...but if it was me,
and this is just me...

249
00:15:26,103 --> 00:15:28,833
-...l would bow out.
-What?

250
00:15:30,608 --> 00:15:33,702
What are you talking about?

251
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,478
They have a kid together,
you know?

252
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:42,483
They're, like, a family.

253
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,079
And if, l don't know...

254
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:48,384
...if there's a chance
they can make that work...

255
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:51,528
...l know l wouldn't wanna be
the guy who stood in the way.

256
00:15:56,234 --> 00:15:58,259
You okay?

257
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,534
You....

258
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:04,539
You wanna come poke a nude guy?

259
00:16:06,577 --> 00:16:09,410
Well, he's finally asleep.

260
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,377
About that bump on his head....

261
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:16,246
Are you sure it's a new bump?

262
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,652
No offense, but l've always thought
of Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.

263
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:24,452
lt's okay if he bumps his head.
Kids bump their heads all the time.

264
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:27,621
lt was your first time babysitting.
You did the best you could.

265
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:30,192
-l did!
-l know.

266
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:32,666
You have to watch them
all the time.

267
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,703
l did! l watched! l watched!

268
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:39,172
l watched Monica bang his head
against that thing!

269
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:42,543
Monica did it?

270
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:51,753
Did you notice anything weird
about Ben today?

271
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:53,181
No, why?

272
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:57,350
l was just playing with him, and we
were doing the ''Alphabet Song'' ...

273
00:16:57,528 --> 00:17:00,656
...which he used to be good at.
Suddenly, he's leaving out E and F.

274
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:05,234
lt's like they just, l don't know,
fell out of his head.

275
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:11,774
-Really?
-And also, he's walking...

276
00:17:11,943 --> 00:17:13,069
...kind of funny.

277
00:17:14,712 --> 00:17:19,240
lt's like his left leg is moving
a lot faster than his right leg.

278
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,214
Yeah, he's in there, just....

279
00:17:25,056 --> 00:17:28,822
Oh, my God!
l wrecked your baby!

280
00:17:30,795 --> 00:17:34,196
l hope it's still funny
when you're in hell.

281
00:17:34,732 --> 00:17:35,824
You jerk!

282
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,131
-You know how much l love that kid!
-Monica bang! Monica bang!

283
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,574
l'll get the hat.

284
00:17:50,147 --> 00:17:52,138
l have something to tell you.

285
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:54,580
And l want you to let me
get through it...

286
00:17:54,752 --> 00:17:56,913
...because...

287
00:17:57,088 --> 00:18:01,548
-...it's not gonna be easy.
-Okay.

288
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:07,355
l think you should go back with Gary.

289
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,435
l don't want to be the guy
that breaks up a family.

290
00:18:11,736 --> 00:18:15,297
You know, when my parents split up,
it was because of that guy.

291
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:17,805
Whenever l would see him,
l would always think:

292
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:21,502
''You're the reason.
You are why they're not together.''

293
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,876
And l hated that guy.

294
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:30,610
And it didn't matter how nice he was
or how happy he made my dad.

295
00:18:41,232 --> 00:18:43,860
lt's the right thing to do.

296
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:46,260
You're right.

297
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:52,334
Oh, God.
But before l can say goodbye...

298
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,339
...there's something l really
need you to know.

299
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:59,278
The way l feel about you...

300
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,749
...it's like l finally understand...

301
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,412
...what Lionel Richie's
been singing about.

302
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:09,159
You know?
l mean, what we have...

303
00:19:09,326 --> 00:19:12,420
...it's like movie love.

304
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,424
You're my soul mate.

305
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,567
l can't believe we're not gonna
spend the rest of our lives together.

306
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:24,464
Then don't leave me.

307
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:25,964
What?

308
00:19:26,143 --> 00:19:29,112
Forget what l said.
l was babbling. Pick me!

309
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,977
No, you were right! l gotta give
my marriage another chance.

310
00:19:33,851 --> 00:19:35,751
No, you don't!

311
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,151
l say, you have to give your divorce
another chance!

312
00:19:39,323 --> 00:19:43,919
Sweetie, you should not have
to settle for just half my heart.

313
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:47,189
l'll settle for half your heart.
l'll settle for a quarter.

314
00:19:47,364 --> 00:19:51,323
l'll settle for a little, tiny--
A ventricle.

315
00:19:54,438 --> 00:19:56,929
l'm sorry.

316
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:04,577
-Don't go.
-No, l gotta go.

317
00:20:05,316 --> 00:20:07,045
No.

318
00:20:07,218 --> 00:20:08,981
No! No, no.

319
00:20:09,153 --> 00:20:11,212
Honey. Honey.

320
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:14,414
-People are looking.
-l don't care.

321
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:16,219
l don't care!

322
00:20:17,061 --> 00:20:19,529
Yeah, okay. l'm....

323
00:20:19,697 --> 00:20:22,097
l'm leaving now.

324
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:26,860
You can't leave! l have your shoe!

325
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:33,608
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.

326
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:47,180
Rachel has those in burgundy.

327
00:20:49,593 --> 00:20:54,462
Remember, something this big and long
will be very difficult to maneuver.

328
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:57,567
Fortunately, l have
experience in that area.

329
00:20:58,469 --> 00:21:00,699
What are you, 1 2 today?

330
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:05,772
Can we please focus here? A naked
man's life hangs in the balance.

331
00:21:05,943 --> 00:21:07,376
l'm telling you, he's dead.

332
00:21:07,545 --> 00:21:10,981
What we're about to have here
is a dead, fat guy on a stick!

333
00:21:11,949 --> 00:21:14,816
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
let's poke.

334
00:21:14,985 --> 00:21:15,974
Steady.

335
00:21:16,153 --> 00:21:17,882
Steady.

336
00:21:18,055 --> 00:21:20,046
Okay, a little higher.

337
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,815
Careful of the angle.

338
00:21:21,992 --> 00:21:24,722
Okay, okay.
We're approaching the window.

339
00:21:28,632 --> 00:21:31,567
Thread the needle. Thread the needle.

340
00:21:36,807 --> 00:21:40,004
He's alive! He's alive!

341
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:44,013
And yet we're still poking him.

342
00:21:44,181 --> 00:21:47,048
Okay, retract the device!
Retract the device!

343
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:50,047
