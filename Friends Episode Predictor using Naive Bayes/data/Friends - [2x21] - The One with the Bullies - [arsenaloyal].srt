1
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:05,605
Why are we watching
the Business Channel?

2
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:11,108
Because the other day I saw there was
a stock with my initials, MEG, on it.

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,075
Sometimes it takes two or three hours
before it comes up again.

4
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,249
But when it does, it's exciting.

5
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:20,414
Okay, honey, you really need a job.

6
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:24,220
Dad says he knows someone
you can call for an interview.

7
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:28,088
Right there! That's the third
sign today. Right there.

8
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,461
On behalf of everyone,
I'd just like to say, "Huh?"

9
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:36,601
No, you just said "dad."
And everywhere I go today...

10
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:39,364
... I keep getting signs
telling me to go see my father.

11
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:42,872
Like when I was walking over here
and I passed a buffet.

12
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:47,280
Which is my father's last name.

13
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,213
And they were serving franks...

14
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:53,443
...which is his first name
minus the "s" at the end.

15
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:58,590
And there was a rotisserie
with a spinning chicken.

16
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,783
His lndian name?

17
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:06,065
No. Because I chickened out
the last time...

18
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:10,295
...when I tried to meet him.
So coincidences? I don't think so.

19
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:12,734
-Very freaky.
-Eerie.

20
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:14,736
Who wants the last hamburger?

21
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:17,102
That's it.
Now I have to go see him.

22
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:18,376
Why?

23
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,173
Hamburger? McDonald's?

24
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,818
Old McDonald had a farm.
My dad is a pharmacist.

25
00:01:26,818 --> 00:01:32,818
And ei ei oh, 
It's what your mom said when you father left you.

26
00:01:33,418 --> 00:01:35,418
Yes! really? No!

27
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:40,089
The One With the Bullies

28
00:02:25,268 --> 00:02:27,395
Man, I am so beat.

29
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:30,598
You wanna forget racquetball
and hang out?

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,273
Yeah, all right.

31
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:37,810
-Hey, you're in our seats.
-Sorry, we didn't know.

32
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:39,573
We were sitting there.

33
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,983
Okay.
There is one more way to say it.

34
00:02:43,187 --> 00:02:44,779
Who knows it?

35
00:02:46,423 --> 00:02:50,826
-Was that supposed to be funny?
-Actually, I was going for colorful.

36
00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:53,459
-What's with this guy?
-What's with you?

37
00:02:53,664 --> 00:02:55,757
Nothing. Nothing's with him.

38
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:57,456
Enjoy your coffee.

39
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,967
What just happened?

40
00:03:07,444 --> 00:03:10,811
I just took your hat.
See, I can be funny too.

41
00:03:11,048 --> 00:03:13,983
My joke is that I took your hat.

42
00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:16,379
That is funny.

43
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,546
Can I have it back?

44
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:29,862
You know what?
I think you're very funny.

45
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:32,661
Kudos on that hat joke.

46
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:37,964
But come on, guys,
just give him back the hat.

47
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:39,474
Why should we?

48
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,703
Because it's a special hat.

49
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:46,612
He bought it because
he was feeling down one day.

50
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:48,079
So he got the hat...

51
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,650
...to cheer himself up, you know?

52
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:54,419
-Chandler
-Stop talking. Stop talking now.

53
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:58,525
Let me get this straight.
You're stealing my hat?

54
00:03:58,829 --> 00:03:59,761
You got a problem?

55
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,828
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

56
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:08,828
I'm telling you Rach, 
I've gone dead hunting with Phabby before.

57
00:04:09,128 --> 00:04:12,128
It's a very scary thing for her, 
and she is very vunlerable.

58
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:17,128
That's why we are there. 
You know, be supported or crap.

59
00:04:18,128 --> 00:04:21,128
Ok, will you just let me know when to do witch.

60
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:26,198
How'd the interview go?

61
00:04:26,571 --> 00:04:27,629
It bit.

62
00:04:28,974 --> 00:04:30,965
It was a 50s theme restaurant.

63
00:04:31,276 --> 00:04:34,734
I'd have to cook in a costume
and dance on the counter.

64
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,674
I was a sous chef
at Cafe des Artistes.

65
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:41,876
How can I take a job where I have
to make Laverne-and-Curly Fries?

66
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:44,387
-Don't do it.
-How can I not do it?

67
00:04:44,623 --> 00:04:46,386
I have $127 in the bank!

68
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:49,593
Monica, relax. Go get a beer.

69
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:51,092
I don't want a beer.

70
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:52,763
Who said it was for you?

71
00:05:01,473 --> 00:05:02,770
What's the matter?

72
00:05:02,974 --> 00:05:06,102
Some mean guys at the coffeehouse
took my hat.

73
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:08,106
-No!
-You're kidding?

74
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:10,781
It was ridiculous.
These guys were bullies.

75
00:05:10,982 --> 00:05:12,950
Actual bullies.

76
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:17,087
We're grownups. This kind of stuff
isn't supposed to happen anymore.

77
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,685
Oh, no, wait a minute.
I have no one.

78
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:29,023
Let's go down there
and get your hat back.

79
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:33,430
Forget it. It's probably stripped
and sold for parts by now.

80
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:37,537
-I went up!
-What?

81
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:41,040
My stock, MEG, it went up two points.

82
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,477
Do you realize that if I'd invested
my $127 in myself yesterday...

83
00:05:45,684 --> 00:05:49,450
...that l'd, like, have
a lot more than that today.

84
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:52,485
You know what?
I'm going to do it.

85
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,653
-Do what?
-Put all my money in me.

86
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:58,694
You don't know a thing
about the stock market.

87
00:05:58,897 --> 00:06:02,025
What's to know?
Buy, sell. High, low. Bears, bulls.

88
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:03,496
Yes, Manhattan.

89
00:06:04,302 --> 00:06:06,497
Telephone number for the stock...

90
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:08,735
...selling store.

91
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:22,084
See? I told you these pillows
would be a good idea.

92
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:23,846
Oh, God.

93
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:25,916
Here we go.

94
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:30,653
For the first time in my life,
I'm gonna say, "Hi, Birth Father!"

95
00:06:31,596 --> 00:06:33,223
-We love you. We're here for you.
-Good luck.

96
00:06:33,498 --> 00:06:34,658
Thanks.

97
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,936
Hey, Rach, you want some sandwich?

98
00:06:41,173 --> 00:06:42,697
What is in that?

99
00:06:42,908 --> 00:06:45,069
Olive loaf and ham spread. No mayo.

100
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:48,210
No, because mayo,
that would make it gross.

101
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,875
-Run, Phoebe, run!
-No, no, doggy, please!

102
00:06:55,086 --> 00:06:58,681
I do so want to love all animals.
Please, no. Back off!

103
00:06:58,957 --> 00:07:01,016
-You got a bone?
-Are you kidding?

104
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:03,421
Look, kibbles! Bits!

105
00:07:04,362 --> 00:07:07,593
Get the hell off my leg,
you yippity piece of crap!

106
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:17,106
Okay. All right. We have a problem.

107
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:20,200
Why don't you take his trampoline?

108
00:07:20,812 --> 00:07:22,803
Okay, here, I know what we can do.

109
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:28,243
Okay, doggy, get the sandwich!

110
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,247
Go get the sandwich!
Good doggy. Get the sandwich!

111
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:36,486
The dog will lick himself
but he will not touch your sandwich.

112
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:38,228
What does that tell you?

113
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:42,895
-lf he's not going to eat it, I will.
-Are you crazy?

114
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:44,762
He's just a little dog.

115
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,136
-Hey.
-What?

116
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:56,177
Do you have to be a Century 21
real-estate agent...

117
00:07:56,382 --> 00:07:58,714
...to get to wear those cool jackets?

118
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:03,549
Do you say this stuff to girls?

119
00:08:06,258 --> 00:08:09,352
Isn't that the guy
who used to wear your hat?

120
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:11,426
And look where they're sitting.

121
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,734
You're joking, right?
You guys just walked through the door.

122
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:21,199
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.

123
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:24,035
This couch belongs to us.

124
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:27,370
I'll tell you what,
you call the couch...

125
00:08:28,013 --> 00:08:30,345
...and then we'll call the couch...

126
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:34,383
...and we'll see who it comes to.

127
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:42,383
You know what I don't like you.
You always got something to say.

128
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:50,484
You know, I keep wondering
why you two are still sitting here.

129
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:52,022
All right, that's it.

130
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,689
I have had enough of this.

131
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:56,218
Gunther.

132
00:08:57,665 --> 00:09:00,361
These guys are trying
to take our seat.

133
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:03,798
Fellas, these guys were here first.

134
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:05,869
Oh, sorry, didn't realize.

135
00:09:06,307 --> 00:09:07,331
There you go.

136
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,532
Thank you, Gunther.

137
00:09:12,546 --> 00:09:15,208
We didn't want to have
to go and do that.

138
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:17,875
He told on us?

139
00:09:18,385 --> 00:09:19,579
You told on us?

140
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,085
Well, pal, you didn't
give me much of a choice.

141
00:09:24,591 --> 00:09:26,855
-Don't play with his thing.
-I know.

142
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:30,218
All right.

143
00:09:31,098 --> 00:09:32,861
Let's take this outside.

144
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:38,500
"Let's take this outside?"

145
00:09:40,908 --> 00:09:43,103
Who talks like that?

146
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,744
The guy who's about to kick your ass
talks like that.

147
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:49,573
You had to ask.

148
00:09:53,354 --> 00:09:55,686
Okay, okay, look. See...

149
00:09:55,956 --> 00:09:59,949
...the thing is, we're not gonna
fight you guys.

150
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:02,322
Here's the deal.

151
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:07,466
You won't have to, so long as you
never ever show your faces here again.

152
00:10:12,906 --> 00:10:15,636
I think you played
the Gunther card too soon.

153
00:10:21,982 --> 00:10:24,246
Hey, Pheebs, I think you're good to go.

154
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:26,146
Yeah, I don't know.

155
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:29,281
What's the matter?

156
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,323
I just think that this was
a really bad sign.

157
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:35,585
Like the beast at the threshold.

158
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:41,899
It's just I have no family left,
except for my grandmother.

159
00:10:42,136 --> 00:10:45,128
But let's face it, she's not
gonna be around forever.

160
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:46,772
Despite what she says.

161
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:53,379
And I have a sister who I've barely
spoken to since we shared a womb.

162
00:10:54,748 --> 00:10:56,773
I don't know. This is my real father...

163
00:10:57,017 --> 00:11:00,350
...and I want things to be,
like, just right.

164
00:11:00,587 --> 00:11:02,179
I completely understand.

165
00:11:02,456 --> 00:11:03,582
Whatever you need.

166
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,922
Hey, you want to go home?

167
00:11:07,194 --> 00:11:09,424
Okay, thanks. Sorry, again.

168
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:30,510
What was that?

169
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:37,688
I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.

170
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:45,461
I want to buy five shares of SGJ.
Now.

171
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:48,030
Come on, time is money, my friend!

172
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,492
Thank you!

173
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,304
"Time is money, my friend?"

174
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:55,633
You missed "Takes money to make money"...

175
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:59,800
...and "Don't make me come down there
and kick your Wall Street butt."

176
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:03,813
I made $ 17 before breakfast.
What have you done?

177
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:07,645
I had breakfast here,
so technically I saved $3.50.

178
00:12:09,088 --> 00:12:10,555
How did you make $17?

179
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:13,054
Well, my financially
challenged friends...

180
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:16,590
...I split my money and I bought
some shares of CHP and ZXY.

181
00:12:17,563 --> 00:12:18,757
How come those?

182
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:23,559
Well, CHP because I used to have a
crush on Erik Estrada.

183
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,104
And ZXY because I think
it sounds "zexy."

184
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:31,065
What happened to MEG?

185
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:33,711
MEG was good for me, but I dumped her.

186
00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:37,107
My motto is, "Get out
before they go down."

187
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,351
That is so not my motto.

188
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,052
How's the dog?

189
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:52,753
Okay. I talked to the vet.
People are so nice upstate.

190
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:56,594
He said the little fella's gonna be
okay, and I can get him tomorrow.

191
00:12:56,802 --> 00:12:58,429
-Good.
-Thank God.

192
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:01,401
But he did have to have
a bunch of stitches.

193
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:05,634
And he said that only once in a blue
moon does a dog's ear grow back.

194
00:13:06,212 --> 00:13:08,373
So still hoping.

195
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:15,618
Now are you going to call your dad
to let him know that his dog is okay?

196
00:13:15,988 --> 00:13:19,480
I don't want to meet my father
over the phone.

197
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,283
What will I say,
"Hi, I'm the daughter you abandoned.

198
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:25,052
Oh, by the way, I broke your dog."

199
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:28,656
Hey, Pheebs, if you want, I'll do it.

200
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:34,230
Listen, just don't say anything
about me, okay?

201
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,964
Don't...

202
00:13:38,077 --> 00:13:40,102
... be too long with the phone.

203
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:44,109
She'll be a much better friend
once the market closes.

204
00:13:47,086 --> 00:13:47,916
It's a woman.

205
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:49,584
So talk to her.

206
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,490
Hello, Mrs. Buffay.

207
00:13:56,195 --> 00:13:58,493
I know where your dog is.

208
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:03,927
I want you to know he'll be returned
to you almost as good as new...

209
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:05,966
...within 24 hours.

210
00:14:06,171 --> 00:14:07,661
Goodbye.

211
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:16,605
-Why the voice?
-Hard to say.

212
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,616
Your cappuccino, sir.

213
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,117
Thank you.

214
00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:29,959
-This is better than the coffeehouse.
-Absolutely.

215
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:41,472
How come it's not mixing
with the water?

216
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:44,142
The package says to keep it moving.

217
00:14:44,376 --> 00:14:46,742
Stir and drink, never let it settle.

218
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:54,149
This is ridiculous.

219
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:57,083
After I get back from
my niece's christening...

220
00:14:57,323 --> 00:15:01,692
...I'll go to the coffeehouse with you
and we'll have a cup of coffee.

221
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:04,361
No problem. Joey's there.

222
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:14,338
I don't want to have to have Joey with
me every time I want decent coffee.

223
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:18,165
And I don't want to drink
cappuccino with a "k."

224
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,504
I say you and I go
and stand up to those guys.

225
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:24,182
All right, hang on
a second there, Custer.

226
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:28,186
Ross, have you ever
been beaten up before?

227
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:29,354
Yeah, sure.

228
00:15:29,755 --> 00:15:32,349
By someone besides Monica?

229
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,489
So what?

230
00:15:34,693 --> 00:15:38,720
So we get beaten up. Maybe that's
something a man has to go through.

231
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:41,923
Like a rite of passage or something.

232
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:45,227
Couldn't we just lose
our virginities again?

233
00:15:46,372 --> 00:15:49,136
Because I think actually
mine's growing back.

234
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:52,136
Are you go with me or not. Come on.

235
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:58,136
All right, I'm go with you.
Just prepare clean underware for the hospital.

236
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,038
-I need $100.
-What?

237
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:05,871
Welcome home.

238
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:07,948
-I need $100.
-For what?

239
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,641
-To get back in the game.
-When did you get out?

240
00:16:10,852 --> 00:16:13,616
I lost it all. I lost it.

241
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:17,220
I've come to terms with it,
you have to, too.

242
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:23,529
Look, Mon, I'm really sorry.

243
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,461
Where are we on the $100?

244
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:26,861
I don't have it.

245
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,660
But I need it!

246
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:31,938
Otherwise, I'll have to
take that diner job.

247
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,338
You know, with the dancing
and the costumes.

248
00:16:39,514 --> 00:16:42,642
I don't want to have to wear
flame-retardant boobs.

249
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,312
Nobody does, honey.

250
00:16:50,258 --> 00:16:51,520
Noodle!

251
00:16:51,726 --> 00:16:56,163
Oh, my God. What the hell
happened to my dog?

252
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:57,524
It was an accident.

253
00:16:57,732 --> 00:17:01,065
And the woman who did this
would never hurt a dog on purpose.

254
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:02,930
She's a vegetarian.

255
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:05,432
Are these stitches?

256
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:09,269
Yeah, eight of them.
That's 56 to him.

257
00:17:10,178 --> 00:17:12,908
If it's raining, you can't
let him look up...

258
00:17:13,181 --> 00:17:15,342
... because that cone
will fill up fast.

259
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:18,914
Thanks for bringing back
what's left of him.

260
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,248
-ls Frank home?
-How do you know Frank?

261
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:25,517
Just from a long time ago.
Is he here?

262
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:32,355
What?

263
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:35,869
I mean Frank Senior.

264
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:37,800
He went out for groceries.

265
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,301
Will he be back soon?

266
00:17:39,774 --> 00:17:43,141
He left four years ago.
We're expecting him back any minute.

267
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,606
I'm gonna go.

268
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,113
I'm sorry about the dog.
Everything.

269
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:50,408
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:52,210
Hey, lady!

271
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,315
Hey, wait up!

272
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,589
-How do you know my dad?
-Well, I don't really.

273
00:18:02,797 --> 00:18:05,595
Just genetically.

274
00:18:06,134 --> 00:18:08,398
He's kind of my dad too.

275
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:09,893
Heavy.

276
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,071
So did he ever talk about me... Phoebe?

277
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:18,838
No, but he didn't really talk
about anything.

278
00:18:21,082 --> 00:18:22,640
Except stilts.

279
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:26,143
-Stilts?
-Yeah, he loved stilts.

280
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:30,313
One time, I was upstairs stealing
cigarettes out of my mom's purse...

281
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:33,292
...and all of a sudden I look over...

282
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:36,361
...and there's Dad's head,
bobbing past the window.

283
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:41,191
He just had this big smile on his face
and he was waving...

284
00:18:41,469 --> 00:18:44,302
...because he was happiest
when he was on his stilts.

285
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:50,878
I don't know what to do with that.

286
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:52,611
Me neither.

287
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:58,452
So are you, like, my big sister?

288
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:02,150
This is huge. You can buy me beer!

289
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:04,450
I'm not gonna.

290
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:09,391
But you know what's cool? If you had
a friend named Pete, I could say...

291
00:19:09,664 --> 00:19:12,224
... "I know Pete.
He's friends with my brother."

292
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:15,835
-I got a friend named Mark.
-That'll work too.

293
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:16,901
Cool. All right.

294
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:22,067
So maybe, you know,
I could give you a call sometime.

295
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:24,638
We could talk or something.

296
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:27,177
-Yeah, that'd be okay.
-All right.

297
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:29,009
I'm in the book.

298
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:35,646
So stilts, huh?

299
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:40,727
If you want, I can show you where
he hit his head on the rain gutter.

300
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:49,401
We did it. We're here.
We are standing our ground.

301
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:54,405
-How long does coffee take?
-Would you come on? Come on!

302
00:19:56,444 --> 00:19:57,570
Thank you.

303
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:11,457
-There we go.
-I think we proved our point.

304
00:20:13,728 --> 00:20:16,390
-You burn your mouth?
-Cannot feel my tongue.

305
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:22,627
Bullies! Big bullies!

306
00:20:23,204 --> 00:20:26,367
Look who's here.
It's the weenies.

307
00:20:28,043 --> 00:20:30,773
Did we not make ourselves clear
the other day?

308
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,378
That's why we're here.

309
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:34,912
Yes, we're standing our ground.

310
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,281
Apparently.

311
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:39,143
Let's do this already.

312
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:40,445
You got a weapon?

313
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:44,421
A nice watch.
I don't want to break it on your ribs.

314
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:45,888
All right, let's do this.

315
00:20:47,662 --> 00:20:52,292
Question: If I don't care about
my watch, can I use it as a weapon?

316
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,660
-What do you mean?
-It's sharp, it's metal.

317
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:57,769
I think I can do some
serious damage with it.

318
00:20:58,506 --> 00:21:00,337
No, you can't use your watch.

319
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:03,672
Or your keys.

320
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:05,845
Here's what we'll do.

321
00:21:06,147 --> 00:21:09,583
We'll put all keys and watches
in the hat over there.

322
00:21:09,984 --> 00:21:11,008
All right?

323
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,512
All right, come on, man. Let's do it!

324
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:19,316
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?

325
00:21:19,627 --> 00:21:21,424
Of course. Why wouldn't you hit faces?

326
00:21:21,663 --> 00:21:24,928
I have to work on Monday.
I have a big presentation.

327
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:29,136
Actually, I gotta show
this apartment tomorrow...

328
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,669
...and this no-faces thing
might not be a bad idea.

329
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:35,273
Nothing from the neck up.

330
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,873
Or the waist down.

331
00:21:39,814 --> 00:21:42,647
-Dana's ovulating.
-Really? You guys trying again?

332
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:47,045
Let me get this straight.
We're talking about the middle?

333
00:21:47,288 --> 00:21:48,186
Come on!

334
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:52,219
You want a piece of this?
I'm standing here!

335
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,053
Those guys are taking our stuff!

336
00:22:01,002 --> 00:22:03,334
God, that was amazing.
That was incredible.

337
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:06,472
-You guys kicked butt!
-Us? What about you guys?

338
00:22:06,674 --> 00:22:09,472
You really gave it to
old Mr. Clean back there.

339
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:12,474
-He was a big guy.
-Yeah, he was, wasn't he?

340
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,671
I wouldn't know,
having missed everything.

341
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:17,008
Don't do that to yourself.

342
00:22:17,218 --> 00:22:21,052
Any one of us could have tripped
over that little girl's jump rope.

343
00:22:23,324 --> 00:22:25,918
So listen, guys...

344
00:22:27,362 --> 00:22:28,590
...are we okay here?

345
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,024
We're okay.

346
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,329
So can I have my hat back?

347
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,783
Oh, my God. Look at her.

348
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:54,787
Hi, Monica!

349
00:22:56,257 --> 00:22:57,451
How's it going?

350
00:22:57,692 --> 00:22:59,091
Hey, nice boobs.

351
00:23:00,528 --> 00:23:02,359
Guys, guys. Check this out.

352
00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:22,973
Excellent.
