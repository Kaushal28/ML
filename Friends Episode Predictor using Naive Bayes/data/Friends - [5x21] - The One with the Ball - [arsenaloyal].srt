1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,864
I'll get coffee.
Want anything, baby doll?

2
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:06,436
I'm fine. Thanks.

3
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,938
I can't pull off "baby doll," can l?

4
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:12,567
No, I think we learned that
from the "sugar lips" incident.

5
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:14,406
I'll make some tea.

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,906
How you doing, pumpkin?

7
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:22,783
-So it's going well for you two?
-I know. Really well.

8
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,680
I'm gonna ask Phoebe
to move in with me.

9
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,354
What do you think?

10
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,585
It's great!
When will you ask her?

11
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,593
Tonight. But don't say anything.

12
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,356
I swear. I promise.

13
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:34,863
I'm so excited!

14
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,365
But listen, do not
get her flowers, okay?

15
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:41,131
Because she cries when they die.
Then there's the whole funeral.

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,743
-I'll see you after work, sweetie.
-Okay. Bye.

17
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,443
So, what movie should we see?

18
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,252
Gary's gonna ask you
to move in with him!

19
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,710
What? Really?

20
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:59,881
He made me promise not to tell,
but I couldn't hold it in any longer!

21
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:01,920
I can't believe this.

22
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:05,564
Right? Because it's fast.
Because it's so fast. It's fast.

23
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,759
Relax. It's Phoebe, not you.

24
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,604
Good for you, Phoebe.
Way to go.

25
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,736
No, but it is fast, isn't it?

26
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:18,110
-I like him, but I'm not ready.
-So, what are you gonna do?

27
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:22,179
I don't know. I'll just handle it.
I'll ask you to talk to him!

28
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:23,940
Me? Why me?

29
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,175
Because you are
so afraid of commitment.

30
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:30,321
You talk to him. Make him scared
like you, make him a man.

31
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,615
I'll try, but I'm not sure
what good it'd do.

32
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,328
I'm less afraid of commitment
than I used to be.

33
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,656
That is so sweet.

34
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,029
Still terrified.
I'll take care of it.

35
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,375
The One With the Ball

36
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:39,184
Hey, Ross, is Staten lsland
really an island?

37
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,557
That's why they call it
Staten "lsland."

38
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,760
Oh, I thought it was
like Long lsland.

39
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,704
Also an island.

40
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,532
-What time is it?
-2:17.

41
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,774
We haven't dropped
this ball for an hour.

42
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:02,904
Are you serious?

43
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,813
I realized it a half-hour ago,
but I didn't say anything.

44
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,212
I didn't wanna jinx it.

45
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,389
We are pretty good at this.

46
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,056
We totally forgot about lunch.

47
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,257
That's the first time
I've ever missed a meal.

48
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,591
I think my pants are a little loose.

49
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,231
Hey, you guys. Is Monica here?

50
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,401
I bought something.
I'm not sure she'll like it.

51
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:35,513
It may seem crazy, but I've wanted
this since I was a little girl.

52
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,682
You bought Shaun Cassidy!

53
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:39,913
No. I wish!

54
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,484
Okay, you ready?

55
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,482
Check it out.

56
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,659
What is it?

57
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,629
What the hell is that?

58
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,330
It's a cat.

59
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,869
That is not a cat!

60
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,467
Yes, it is!

61
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,973
Why is it inside out?

62
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,210
Excuse me!

63
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:14,715
But this is a purebred,
show-quality sphinx cat.

64
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,479
How much did you pay for that?

65
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,022
It was extravagant,
but I got a good deal.

66
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,124
-How much?
-Thousand bucks.

67
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,459
On a cat?

68
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,164
It's not a cat!

69
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:34,200
For a thousand dollars,
you'd think at least it'd come with hair.

70
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,768
Or something.

71
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,906
All right. Listen, ball boys.

72
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,807
My grandma had one when I was little.
It was the sweetest thing.

73
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:46,144
It would sit in my lap
and just purr all day long.

74
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,219
I would drag a string
and it would chase it.

75
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,423
Free cats do that too, you know.

76
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,116
It's not a cat!

77
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,189
I'm really excited about this, okay?
I don't care what you think.

78
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,629
I'm gonna set up a litter box
for Mrs. Whiskerson.

79
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,431
What am I gonna call her?
Fluffy?

80
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,878
Do you wanna get something to eat,
or see how long we can throw this ball?

81
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,877
The ball thing.

82
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:23,481
Wouldn't it be great if we could go
for two hours without dropping it?

83
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,655
Yeah, it would!

84
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,418
Let's do it.

85
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,234
I have to pee.

86
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,596
And Rachel's in the bathroom!

87
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,138
Man, I didn't think we'd make it.

88
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,110
I know.

89
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,305
Don't switch hands, okay?

90
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:01,287
Hey, ladies.
What are you in here for?

91
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,790
What are you doing here?

92
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,024
I am here to report a crime.

93
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,736
It's a crime that
we don't spend time together.

94
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,860
What's up?

95
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,701
You're thinking about moving in with
Phoebe, and I thought we should talk.

96
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,206
You know, man to...

97
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:21,777
...well, me.

98
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,206
Sure, okay.

99
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,614
Are you crazy?

100
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:28,275
Are you insane?

101
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:32,514
If you live with Phoebe, you two
are gonna be living together.

102
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,189
I considered that.
It'd make me happy.

103
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,026
-You mean scared.
-No, I mean happy.

104
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,291
Scared happy.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,160
What are you doing?

106
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,995
I'm trying to open your eyes!

107
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,001
If you live with Phoebe,
she is always gonna be there.

108
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,207
You get home, she's there.
You go to bed, she's there.

109
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,138
You wake up and, oh, yes, she's there.

110
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,246
I know. I can't wait!

111
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:59,045
Were your parents happy or something?

112
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,420
I was lucky enough to find
someone that I really love.

113
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,749
I just want to be around her
as much as I can.

114
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:10,022
When you say it,
it doesn't sound so scary.

115
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,560
You know what I'm saying?

116
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,493
Yeah, I think I do.

117
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,859
You know what?

118
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:19,401
Move in with her. Move in right now.
Maybe I'll move in with Monica.

119
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,039
No, it's too soon for you guys.

120
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,240
You're right about that.

121
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,043
When they found the remains
of the Mesozoic mastodon...

122
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,878
...they discovered what appeared
to be the remains...

123
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,556
...of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws.

124
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,851
How did it get there?

125
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,954
Maybe this should be more
of a quiet game.

126
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,998
Hey, guys.

127
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,931
I left my watch here last night.

128
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,361
-lt was here. Where is it?
-I don't know.

129
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,970
I'm late for work.

130
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,199
How do you know?
You don't have a watch.

131
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,943
Can you stop throwing the ball
for one minute and help me find it?

132
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,582
Oh, I don't know....
Yeah, can't do it.

133
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,318
-What?
-Do not drop that ball.

134
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,787
We haven't dropped it in....

135
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,995
Two hours, 27 minutes.

136
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,830
Really?

137
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,925
I won't make it in to work today.

138
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,230
I don't feel very good.

139
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,741
For a second, I thought I was
feeling better, but I'm not.

140
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,444
Hey, Rach.

141
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,415
Check it out. Almost three hours
without dropping it.

142
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,918
Congratulations.
That's quite a waste of time.

143
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,790
You have scratches all over you.

144
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,518
Well, it's my cat.

145
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,792
-Oh, I got a cat.
-I don't want a cat!

146
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,433
Don't worry, it's not a cat.

147
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:01,200
You guys, this cat is nothing
like my grandmother's cat.

148
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,340
It's not sweet.
It's not cute.

149
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:08,706
I dragged a string, and it flipped out
and scratched the hell out of me.

150
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:14,380
I know this sounds crazy,
but every time this cat hisses at me...

151
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,545
...I know it's saying, "Rachel!"

152
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,662
Doesn't sound as crazy
as paying $1000 for a cat.

153
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,164
You paid $1000 for a cat
when you owe me $300?

154
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,202
Well, I was gonna let you
play with it.

155
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,977
Did you talk to Gary
about moving in?

156
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,876
I think you should do it.

157
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:51,220
He's a great guy and he loves you
a lot. You are a very lucky lady.

158
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,247
You are useless!

159
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,896
Freaking out about commitment
is the one thing you can do...

160
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,098
...and you can't even do that right!

161
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,029
Sorry. If he asked me,
I'd move in with him.

162
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,570
Get out of here, good-for-nothing.

163
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,801
Hey, Chandler.

164
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,276
Hey, Gar.

165
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,348
Hey, sweetie.

166
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,676
Can I talk to you for a second?

167
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:23,881
You look pretty today.

168
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,715
Thanks. Okay.

169
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,282
Here's the thing.

170
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,621
I really want this relationship
to move forward.

171
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:35,060
If you're not moving forward,
you're moving backwards.

172
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,270
No, if you're not moving forward,
you're staying still.

173
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,370
And staying still is good.
Watch this.

174
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,870
I want you to move in with me.

175
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,115
That is so sweet.

176
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,646
But don't you think
it's too soon?

177
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,148
There's so much we don't know
about each other.

178
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,822
Okay. I get it.

179
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:05,991
I don't want us to jump into something
that we're not ready for.

180
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,499
I don't want
to mess up what we have.

181
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:16,105
I'm worried it's gonna
be a big mistake.

182
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,508
Which is why my answer is yes!

183
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,416
Really?

184
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,619
You're so happy.

185
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,789
Monica, stop throwing it so hard!

186
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,426
We're on the same team!

187
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,166
You guys have been doing this
for four hours?

188
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,805
That's right, baby.

189
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,668
-All right. Let me in.
-No, no! Don't do it!

190
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,877
What?

191
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,640
He's a dropper.

192
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,516
Oh, yeah. That's right!

193
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,342
I'm not a dropper!

194
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:05,017
It's really a three-person
game, you know?

195
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,126
It's throwing and catching.

196
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,427
All right.

197
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,425
Oh, it's so hard.

198
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,542
Don't worry, guys.
It's not a cat.

199
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,072
Oh, good God!

200
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,547
I give up. I don't know what
I'm gonna do with this thing.

201
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,145
Baking it didn't help?

202
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,126
Take it back to where you got it.

203
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,227
I tried. They won't take her back.

204
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,898
Maybe that's because she's
a minion of the Antichrist.

205
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:50,901
Why won't they take it?

206
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,628
They said they would only
give me store credit.

207
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:57,205
What am I gonna do?
Get 1000 regular cats?

208
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:01,340
You said it was a show cat. Why don't you
show it, win some prize money.

209
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,246
Those shows cost a hundred bucks to enter,
and all you win are these ribbons...

210
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:08,376
...which technically belong to the damn cat.

211
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,955
You can keep it until you
find out what to do with it.

212
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,557
That's not the point.
I'm out $1000...

213
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,259
...I'm all scratched up...

214
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,828
...and I'm stuck with this stupid cat
that looks like a hand!

215
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,458
Oh, my God!

216
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,333
The cat's made my eyes water.
Don't throw it to me!

217
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,235
My vision's been compromised!

218
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,411
Oh, God! Okay.

219
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,675
It's okay. Man, that was close.

220
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,644
Yeah, you almost overreacted
to something.

221
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:46,650
-We have great news.
-We're moving in together. Yay!

222
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,592
Congratulations.

223
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,285
-I'm so excited!
-So am l.

224
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,228
You're not more excited than I am.
No way. I'm the most excited.

225
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,333
See you at the station later.

226
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:00,504
I'll see you later.
Don't forget about the moving-in!

227
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,736
So you're moving in with him?

228
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,902
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad.
Maybe it'll be all right.

229
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,642
I do like him a lot...

230
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,579
...and probably do it
eventually, anyway.

231
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,821
Plus, think of all the money
I'll save on stamps.

232
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,287
Do you write him a lot?

233
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,525
I heard when people live together...

234
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,193
...they split the cost
of stamps, don't they?

235
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,929
-Yeah, yeah.
-That's right.

236
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,336
Sorry, the oven mitts
really freaked me out.

237
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,437
Hey, honey.

238
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,677
Did you find any apartments
in Brooklyn Heights?

239
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,046
No, nothing.

240
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,546
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

241
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,050
-Nothing at all?
-No.

242
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,351
If something opens up, we'll move in.
If it has a pool. I need a pool.

243
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,288
Can I talk to you?

244
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,692
Take a seat.

245
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,628
You okay?

246
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,535
You feel all right?

247
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,676
I feel great, because
we're moving in together.

248
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:14,972
So you....

249
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,911
You checked the paper for listings
in Brooklyn Heights, right?

250
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,648
You checked the Post?

251
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,385
Yeah, there was nothing.

252
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,692
-Can I get some water?
-ln a minute.

253
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:31,827
You checked today's Post?

254
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,089
Yeah, today's.

255
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,499
Because this is today's Post.

256
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,170
And these are the listings I found.

257
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,167
Brooklyn Heights, two bedrooms.
Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.

258
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,539
Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights,
Brooklyn Heights!

259
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:52,573
Oh, are these for rent?
I thought people were just bragging.

260
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,453
Let me tell you what's going on here.

261
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,718
Don't look at the table.
Look at me.

262
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,289
Somebody asked someone
to move in with him.

263
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,359
Someone said yes,
but now she has doubts...

264
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:09,055
...because things are moving too fast.
Does that sound possible?

265
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,562
Yes, fine! I am someone!

266
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,775
You want me to say it?
I have doubts!

267
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,807
I'm sorry!

268
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,313
It's okay that you feel this way.

269
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:30,453
It is soon, and there's things
we don't know about each other.

270
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,157
Everything I know about you,
I really like.

271
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:37,590
Things I don't know, I'll learn in
a place with our names on the mailbox.

272
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,628
That's so sweet.

273
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,900
But if it's too soon for you,
we don't have to do it.

274
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,969
I want you to be happy.

275
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,434
Living with you would make me happy.

276
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:51,802
You don't have to say that.

277
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,841
I want to live with you.
I want to move in with you.

278
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,479
Are you sure?

279
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,647
Definitely, yes! Let's live in
an apartment we both live in.

280
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,750
Oh, that's great.

281
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,580
Oh, wait, one sec.

282
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:08,090
Hey, you! Behind the glass.
Who are you looking at?

283
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:13,788
I always wanted to say that every time
I was in these rooms, which was never.

284
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:17,824
Show cat!

285
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,263
Quality show cat!

286
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,833
-Show cat!
-Oh, my God!

287
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,136
What's wrong with your baby?

288
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,609
That's not a baby. That's a cat.

289
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,548
-It's creepy-looking.
-Oh, no.

290
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:35,345
It's actually very sweet.
It's very sweet. Look.

291
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,690
Yeah. Do you want it?

292
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,292
No, I hate cats.

293
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,291
Then what are you doing to me?

294
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,556
Get out of here, all right?
Move on!

295
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,691
What an unusual cat.

296
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,497
Yes, thank you! Exactly.
You want it?

297
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,163
Maybe.

298
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:58,537
I was thinking about getting a cat
from the shelter, but....

299
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,309
-Okay. Why not?
-Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.

300
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,408
-What?
-Okay, 1000.

301
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,846
Didn't you want me to adopt your cat?

302
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:12,854
I do, but you'll have to look at this
as more of an investment than a cat.

303
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,355
Okay, yeah.
I just wanted a cat.

304
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:23,027
Obviously, you know how to haggle,
so I won't try and take you on.

305
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,432
So $800, and I don't call the cops,
because you are robbing me blind!

306
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:31,075
Blind! Just take the cat.
Leave the money. Run away!

307
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,471
Run away. Damn it!

308
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:37,244
Can't you at least smile or something?

309
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,648
Did anybody just hear that? Anybody?

310
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,722
-I'm starving.
-Come on, guys. Suck it up!

311
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,728
We're closing in on 10 hours.

312
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,924
It's gut-check time!

313
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,300
I don't know who made you the boss.
We invented this game.

314
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,503
I made this game what it is!

315
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,572
Not fun anymore?

316
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,508
I'm still hungry.

317
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,242
There's pizza at my place. We can eat
with one hand. Are you with me?

318
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,145
-I am.
-All right, let's go! Come on!

319
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,246
Let's go, Team Monica!

320
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,451
We can work out the name later.

321
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,490
What is your cat doing in my bowl?

322
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,325
I'm defrosting a chicken.

323
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,663
I sold Mrs. Whiskerson.

324
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,567
Thank God!

325
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,342
-Get your money back?
-Yeah, $1500.

326
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,636
You made a profit?

327
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,612
I just came for the red velvet pillow.

328
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,018
-There you go.
-Thanks, Rachel.

329
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,259
Don't forget, you can come
visit her anytime.

330
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,087
Oh, good. Great.
I'll keep that in mind.

331
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,158
So is this some kind
of snake or something?

332
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,306
I like waking up with you.

333
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,110
I like waking up with you too.

334
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,218
Oh, it's such a beautiful morning.

335
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,887
I could stay here all day.

336
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,953
That would be great.

337
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,855
-We could have breakfast in bed.
-Wait, just a second.

338
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,456
Oh, no.

339
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,165
All right. Come on, Monica!
Look alive. Come on!

340
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,916
Oh, I was having the best dream.

341
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,077
-What?
-I dreamed I was drowning...

342
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,746
...and not throwing this ball.

343
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,683
Oh, good. You're all up.

344
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,360
It's 6:00 in the morning.
Why aren't you at Gary's?

345
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,260
Oh, yeah. That's over.

346
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,468
Gary's such a great guy.
You can work it out.

347
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,694
-He shot a bird.
-That is over.

348
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,038
-I'm sorry.
-That's terrible.

349
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,743
Are you okay?

350
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,401
I'll be all right.

351
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,171
Here, Phoebe.

352
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,373
I don't feel like playing.

353
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,417
It's okay. It's okay.

354
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,385
It didn't happen.
No one needs to know.

355
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,790
She's not an official ball player.

356
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,727
Only official ball players
can drop the ball.

357
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,227
-Come on.
-Let's go.

358
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,329
You wanna get breakfast?

359
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,402
Okay, let's race!

360
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,632
First one there wins.

361
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:55,946
You guys wanna eat here?

362
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:02,879
That was great, huh?

363
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,216
Can you believe how long we threw it?

364
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,551
It is amazing it lasted that long.

365
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,522
My arm is killing me.

366
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:12,356
No, I meant with
the dropper over here.

367
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,895
How did I get this
reputation as a dropper?

368
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,330
I am anything but a dropper.

369
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,026
Ross!
