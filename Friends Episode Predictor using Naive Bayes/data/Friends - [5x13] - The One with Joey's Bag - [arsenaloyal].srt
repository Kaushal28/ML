1
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:07,264
I can't believe we've never
done this. It's so good!

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,965
It's so good for Monica.

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,644
Time's up! My turn.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,216
-That was half an hour?
-It's your timer.

5
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:27,117
I don't like to brag about it,
but I give the best massages.

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,193
All right, then massage me up
right nice!

7
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,835
It's so good, isn't it?

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,300
I don't know what
I did to deserve it.

9
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:45,068
Now stop trying to add more time
to your massage.

10
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,507
Say goodbye to sore muscles!

11
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,715
Goodbye, muscles!

12
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,382
The One with Joey's Bag

13
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,157
She gives the worst massages ever!

14
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,667
It was like she was torturing me
for information.

15
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:50,540
I wanted to give it up.
I just didn't know what it was!

16
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,340
If it hurts that bad,
you should tell her.

17
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:57,343
For the first time,
I'm in a real relationship.

18
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,780
I won't screw that up
by telling the truth.

19
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,389
Dude, look out!

20
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,284
You almost crushed my hat.

21
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,152
Sorry.

22
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,053
And the bunny got away.

23
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,639
This would be the place
where you explain the hat.

24
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,142
This is called a top hat.

25
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:36,979
And why are you wearing this?
Is it "top hat"?

26
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,216
There's this play...

27
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:45,396
...and I'm up for the part of this
cool, suave, international guy.

28
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,496
A clotheshorse. So I figure...

29
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:52,262
...everyone at the audition will
wear ultra-hip, high-fashion stuff.

30
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,268
And you'll make them disappear?

31
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,739
Like you could find something
this sophisticated.

32
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:01,607
Done!

33
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:07,114
If you want to look good,
come to the store. I'll help you.

34
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,785
-Thanks!
-Sure.

35
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,578
Please, take those off!

36
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,052
Hey, Phoebe. How's it going?

37
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,097
Only okay because I just
got back from the hospital.

38
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,133
Are you all right?

39
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,360
I'm fine,
but my grandma sort of died.

40
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:27,895
Phoebe, sorry.

41
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,063
It's okay.

42
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,277
She had a really incredible life.

43
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,536
It's not like I won't see her again.
She'll visit.

44
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,778
Maybe she's with us right now.

45
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:44,922
Right. She's on a new spiritual plain
and she'll come to the coffeehouse.

46
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,616
I just saw two people having sex
in a car right outside!

47
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,055
Phoebe' grandmother just died.

48
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,565
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

49
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:01,098
Actually, it's kind of cool.
Because it's like...

50
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,171
...you know, one life ends
and another begins.

51
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,176
Not the way they're doing it.

52
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,745
What happened?
How did she die?

53
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,112
We were in the market...

54
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:18,984
...and she bent down to get some yogurt
and never came back up again.

55
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,591
I'm so sorry.

56
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,694
The last thing she said was:

57
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,867
"You get the eggs, I'll get the yogurt,
and we'll meet at the checkout counter."

58
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,527
You know what?

59
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,370
We will meet at the checkout counter.

60
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,982
Since you're returning
all this stuff...

61
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,310
...you'll have to wear underwear.

62
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,285
All right.
You'd better show me that too.

63
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,052
It's missing something.

64
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,463
Really? A purse?

65
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,537
It's not a purse.
It's a shoulder bag.

66
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,231
It looks like a woman's purse.

67
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:14,037
Trust me, all the men are carrying
them in the spring catalog.

68
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,976
See, look.
Men carrying the bag.

69
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,512
See, look.
Women carrying the bag.

70
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:33,025
But it is odd how a woman's purse
looks so good on me, a man.

71
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,525
Exactly. Unisex!

72
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,896
Maybe you need sex.
I had sex a couple days ago.

73
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:45,036
No, Joey. U-N-I sex.

74
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,079
I ain't gonna say no to that!

75
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,351
-Who is it?
-It's Phoebe.

76
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,024
Oh, great!

77
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,691
Oh, you.

78
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,692
What's up?

79
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,261
Well, I sort of have some bad news.
Can I come in?

80
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:13,763
No, thanks.

81
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,208
Grandma died today.

82
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,808
Didn't she die like five years ago?

83
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,484
No, she just died today.

84
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,154
We're having
a memorial service tomorrow.

85
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,121
Okay, I know I went to that already.

86
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,827
No, you didn't!

87
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,619
Then who's been dead?

88
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,057
Lots of people!

89
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,659
Look, are you coming or not?

90
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,736
I thought she was dead,
so I've made my peace.

91
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,175
Plus I'm going to a concert.

92
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,939
I'd invite you,
but I only have two tickets left.

93
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,954
-Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
-Thanks. Enjoy your funeral!

94
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,601
You look just like your son,
Mrs. Tribbiani.

95
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,839
What? Are you referring
to my man's bag?

96
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,776
I thought it just looked good,
but it's practical too.

97
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:32,173
It's got compartments for your
wallet, keys, address book....

98
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,340
Your makeup.

99
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,213
What are you doing?
The audition's tomorrow.

100
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,016
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.

101
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,458
You get mustard on that bag,
you can't return it.

102
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,495
Why would I return this?
I love this bag!

103
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:51,032
-All right, then you owe me $350.
-Fine.

104
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:54,529
Do you take Vasa or Mooster Card?

105
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:01,974
Relax, I'll pay you with the money
from the job I'll get. Thanks to you.

106
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,877
What's the part? Auntie Mame?

107
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,717
Don't listen to them.
I think it's sexy.

108
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,251
You-and-I sexy?

109
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,389
Hello, Mrs. Pinilla.
Thank you for coming.

110
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,657
Here's your 3-D glasses.

111
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,999
Reverend Pong will say
when to put them on.

112
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,008
Hi, sweetie.

113
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,203
-How are you holding up?
-Fine.

114
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,015
Hey, Phoebe. I'm so sorry.

115
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,253
You know what?
My grandma had the exact same bag!

116
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,384
I brought you flowers.

117
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,115
Oh, thanks!

118
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,294
Pulling flowers out
makes the bag look masculine.

119
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,629
Excuse me, is this the memorial?

120
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,392
Welcome.

121
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,270
Here's your 3-D glasses.

122
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,205
All right.

123
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,203
So how did you know Frances?

124
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,971
Actually, I hadn't seen her for years.

125
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:12,978
But I was pretty tight
with her and her daughter.

126
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,412
What's your name?

127
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,315
Frank Buffay.

128
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:22,720
You know what? Strike that.
My name, actually, is Joe.

129
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,620
Joe Hill.

130
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:26,787
You're Frank Buf

131
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,397
No! Joe Hill.

132
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,725
You just said

133
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,769
I got to go.
Thank you so much for coming.

134
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,108
Oh, my God!

135
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,472
What happened?

136
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,074
That was my dad.

137
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,910
Check it out!

138
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,910
It's like it's coming right at me.

139
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,595
-Did you catch him?
-What did he say?

140
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,030
He said, "Nice to meet you, Glenda."

141
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,431
I couldn't give him my real name.

142
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:08,765
Why not?

143
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,474
You saw the way he ran.

144
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,474
You think he'd talk
to the daughter he abandoned?

145
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,442
What did you say to him?

146
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:19,879
I said I was the executor of the will
and I needed to talk to him.

147
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,985
I'm going to meet him
at the coffeehouse.

148
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,884
Could everyone take their seats?

149
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,815
I just can't think about that now.

150
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,492
I want to say goodbye to my grandma.

151
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,559
Let's go say goodbye.

152
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,245
I'm off to my audition.
How do I look?

153
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,209
Great!
That bag will get you that part.

154
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,077
And a date with a man.

155
00:10:56,055 --> 00:11:00,151
You know what? Make fun all you want.
This is a great bag.

156
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,055
And it's as handy as it is becoming.

157
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:07,423
Just because you don't understand
something, doesn't make it wrong.

158
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,835
You guys have to get used
to the fact that Joey...

159
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,333
...comes with a bag!

160
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,198
I've got to meet my dad.

161
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,204
Will you tell him who you are?

162
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,039
Not at first.
I don't want to freak him out.

163
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,182
But aren't you pissed at him?

164
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,385
This guy abandoned you.

165
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:30,885
If it were me, this guy would be
in some serious physical danger.

166
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:35,856
I'd walk in there,
I'd be like, "Yo, Dad!

167
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:39,292
You and me, outside.
Right now!"

168
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,094
I kind of scared myself.

169
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,362
Well, at least you scared someone.

170
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,207
You'd think I'd be angry.

171
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:53,538
You'd think I'd want to rip
his tiny, little head off!

172
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,645
Fortunately, I'm past it.

173
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,813
You do seem a little tense.
Here, let me help you.

174
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,142
Get off!

175
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:06,314
Stop it!
Why are you doing that to me?

176
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,320
What are you talking about?

177
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,392
As a masseuse and a human...

178
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,064
...I'm begging you,
never do that to anyone!

179
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,729
I give good massages.

180
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,101
I gave them to Rachel
before she got allergic.

181
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,507
And Chandler, he loves them!
Watch.

182
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,648
He does not like it.
He's in pain!

183
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,614
-No, he's not.
-Yes, he is!

184
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,580
-What?
-I'm sorry, but

185
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,427
You've been lying to me?

186
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,357
I can't believe that.

187
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,624
Maybe he didn't want to hurt you.

188
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:53,134
But the minute we start
to lie to each other....

189
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,498
And by "we"...

190
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,872
...I mean society.

191
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:05,013
Anytime you're ready.

192
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,777
Well, you must be new here.

193
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,318
Maybe we get a table,
I buy you a drink.

194
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,818
Could you try it without the purse?

195
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,521
Yeah, sure.

196
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:24,132
Well, you must be new here.
Maybe we sit

197
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,161
Can I ask you something?

198
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,361
Sure. What?

199
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,165
Well, first,
it's not a purse.

200
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,235
Anytime.

201
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,912
If you think
it's a woman's bag, it's not.

202
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,082
It's a man's bag.

203
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,544
Okay. And go!

204
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,248
Let me show you the catalog.

205
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,017
Look. See?

206
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,027
It's the latest thing.

207
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:53,095
Everyone's got one.
Men, women, children.

208
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,696
Do you sell these?

209
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:00,065
No, these babies sell themselves.

210
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,006
Thank you.
That was great.

211
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,033
But I didn't read anything.

212
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,404
I think we've seen enough.

213
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,738
All right, I'll see you.

214
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,779
We got it. We got it.

215
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,411
Is Rachel here?

216
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:22,724
Listen, I just wanted to apologize
about the whole massage thing.

217
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,453
I really like them.

218
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,223
Please, stop!

219
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,468
We're supposed to be honest.

220
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,398
I wish you could tell me,
"l don't like your massages."

221
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,603
I don't like your massages.

222
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,151
See? It's no big deal.

223
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,151
But now you're crying!

224
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,553
I'm not crying about that.
I'm crying about something at work.

225
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,889
My boyfriend said
he didn't like my massages.

226
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,133
You don't have
to be best at everything.

227
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,997
Oh, my God!
You don't know me at all!

228
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,776
You give the worst massages
in the world.

229
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,068
I'm crying here!

230
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,974
Look, hear me out.

231
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:19,514
You give the best bad-massages.

232
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:23,478
If anybody was looking
for the best bad-massage...

233
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,020
...and they thought,
"Who's the best?"

234
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,691
They'd have to go to you.

235
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,097
So you're saying that
if there was an award...

236
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:41,864
...for the best bad-massage....
Who would get that?

237
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,768
It would be you!

238
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,137
You, Monica!
And you'd get all the votes.

239
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,714
So they could call the award,
"The Monica"?

240
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,146
Absolutely.

241
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,956
I suck!

242
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,491
Thank you for meeting me.

243
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,132
Thank you.

244
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,235
Come sit.

245
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,802
Sit.

246
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,674
Sit!

247
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,545
Alrighty.
Before we get started, I need you...

248
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:25,911
...to state for the record
that you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.

249
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,153
Yes, I am.

250
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,848
What did Frances leave me?

251
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,856
That's why you wanted me to come.

252
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,429
Yes, she did. She left you...

253
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,832
...this lipstick.

254
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,873
It's used.

255
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,610
Cool!

256
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:02,446
I have just a few questions to ask,
so I'll get out my official forms.

257
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,892
So question one:

258
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:12,428
You were married to Frances'
daughter, Lilly. Correct?

259
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,622
Yes, I was.

260
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,229
Question two.
Did that marriage end:

261
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,062
A: Happily?

262
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,602
B: Medium?

263
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:26,036
Or C: In the total abandonment...

264
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,303
...of her and her two children?

265
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,408
It really says that?

266
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,741
Yeah, see?

267
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,152
I guess then I would have to say C.

268
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,451
Total abandonment.

269
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,654
Reasons for abandonment:

270
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,293
A: Top-secret government work.

271
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:47,991
B: Amnesia.

272
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,566
Or C: You're just a selfish,
irresponsible...

273
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,238
...bad, bad man.

274
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,173
I don't want the lipstick that much.

275
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:02,243
Would you do me a favor?

276
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,176
Would you give Lilly...

277
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,310
...that, please?

278
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,516
When you see Lilly,
give her that note.

279
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,155
I wanted to talk to her
at the memorial...

280
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:17,425
...but I pictured her getting mad
the way you did, and I chickened out.

281
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,631
I wrote her a note.
Give it to her, please?

282
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,494
But you came to see Lilly?

283
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,594
Yeah. Why?

284
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,469
Lilly's dead.

285
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,134
She what?

286
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:32,532
She's dead.

287
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,167
Are you sure?

288
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,540
If she isn't, cremating her
was a big mistake.

289
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,815
I can't believe this.
I just can't believe

290
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,817
How?
Oh, my God.

291
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:46,646
How long ago?

292
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,459
17 years ago.

293
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,230
What about the girls?

294
00:18:56,168 --> 00:19:00,036
Well, Ursula is a waitress
and she lives in Soho.

295
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,704
And Phoebe...

296
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,308
...is on this couch.

297
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,686
Yep, lipstick and a daughter.
Big day for you!

298
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,927
Phoebe, l....

299
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:28,560
It's just, I don't know what to say.

300
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:34,702
I just can't believe that you're
my daughter. You're so pretty.

301
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,736
Yes, well, that's neither
here nor there.

302
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,844
Would it make you feel
better if I said...

303
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:47,711
...that I was very, very sorry I left?

304
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,251
It doesn't matter what you say.
It won't make a difference.

305
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,015
So you can just go.

306
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:01,755
Well, you know, in my defense,
I was a lousy father.

307
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,726
-That's your defense?
-Yes, it is.

308
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,963
I burned the formula,
and I put your diapers on backwards.

309
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:13,803
I made up a song to sing to you,
but that made you cry even more.

310
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,873
You make up songs?

311
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:19,242
Well, no, just that one.
But it was stupid.

312
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,284
Let's see, how did it go?

313
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,647
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl

314
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:30,090
Why won't you go to sleep?

315
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,391
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl

316
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,792
You're keeping me up

317
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,788
I'm not very good at this.

318
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,323
Well, I am.

319
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:07,988
Not yet. No.

320
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,165
How'd the audition go?

321
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,973
Estelle said I didn't get it.

322
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,473
What? Why?
Joey, you were so ready for it.

323
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,043
I thought so too...

324
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,908
...but the casting people
had problems with me.

325
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,377
What kind of problem?

326
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,243
To tell you the truth...

327
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,751
...they had a problem with the bag!

328
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,852
You know what?
It was a stupid play anyway.

329
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,525
It's time to give up the bag.

330
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,363
I don't want to give up the bag.

331
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,324
I don't have to give it up.
Do l, Rach?

332
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,173
You think I should give up the bag!

333
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:54,878
Joey, I'm sorry. As terrific
as I think you are with it...

334
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:01,782
...I just don't know if the world
is ready for you and your bag.

335
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,848
I can't believe this!

336
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:09,288
Wait, I'm not saying
you shouldn't have a bag.

337
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:14,726
There are other bags
that are maybe a little less...

338
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:16,957
...controversial.

339
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,698
Yeah, they're called wallets.

340
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,237
You're right. You're right.

341
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,810
This bag has become like a part of me.

342
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:31,039
It's like...my bag.

343
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,481
It had a place for everything.

344
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,419
-Oh, man.
-What?

345
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:42,720
There's a whole series of pockets here
I didn't even know about, Rach. Look.

346
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,459
Ursula, I have the most amazing news.

347
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,795
I found our dad.

348
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,460
Phoebe.

349
00:22:56,441 --> 00:23:00,673
Your sister.
And I found our dad.

350
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,110
John Glenn? John Glenn is not our dad.

351
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:08,418
