1
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,375
We're running low on resumes.

2
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,347
You want a job
with Popular Mechanics?

3
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:23,579
If you're gonna work for mechanics,
those are the ones.

4
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,654
Guys, I'm going for anything here.
I can't be a waitress anymore.

5
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:33,993
I'm sick of the lousy tips.
I'm sick of being called "Excuse Me."

6
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:38,397
-Paper cut! Paper cut!
-Here.

7
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,738
Grapefruit juice! Grapefruit juice!

8
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,874
Okay, we're almost done.
Only 20 more to go.

9
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:52,677
-Rach, did you proofread these?
-Yeah. Why?

10
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:57,885
Nothing. I'm sure they'll be
impressed with your "compuper" skills.

11
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:03,195
Oh, my God!
Do you think it's on all of them?

12
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:10,129
No, I'm sure the Xerox machine
caught a few.

13
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,839
The One With the Poker

14
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:14,767
They call this a love seat but I'm not
feeling anything special towards you.

15
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,507
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

16
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,106
Hi, ladies.

17
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,773
Can I get you anything?
Did you bring the mail?

18
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:37,286
-Lots of responses.
-Really? Sure, we have scones left!

19
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:38,880
Read them.

20
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:43,654
"Dear Miss Greene:
Thank you for your inquiry. However"

21
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:50,265
-We have apple cinnamon
-"Dear Ms. Greene...." Yeah, yeah! No.

22
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,438
-What?
-Your Visa bill is huge!

23
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:57,936
Give me that.

24
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:01,574
Linda's great.
Why won't you go out with her?

25
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,079
-I don't know.
-ls this about her...

26
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,583
... "The Flintstones could
have really happened" thing?

27
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:12,417
It's not just that. I want someone
who does something for me...

28
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,616
...who gets my heart pounding.

29
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,696
Who makes me....

30
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,324
Little playthings with yarn?

31
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,768
What?

32
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,804
Could you want her more?

33
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,230
Who?

34
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,934
Dee, the sarcastic sister
from What's Happening!!.

35
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,150
Look, I'm totally over her.

36
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,653
-Hi!
-Coffee?

37
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,348
-No, we're fine.
-Okay.

38
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,791
-Shut up!
-We're not saying anything.

39
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,630
-What?
-Joey cried last night.

40
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,306
-Thank you.
-We were playing poker

41
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:07,775
There was chocolate on the three.
It looked like an eight.

42
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,439
You should have seen him.
"Read them and weep!"

43
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,482
And then he did.

44
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:18,487
Now, how come you guys
have never played poker with us?

45
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:22,787
Yeah, what is that?
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?

46
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:27,160
-It's poker, so only guys can play?
-No. Women can play.

47
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:32,134
Then, what is it? Some kind of, like,
some kind of, you know

48
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,329
All right, what is it?

49
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,969
There are just no women
in our game.

50
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,977
We just don't know any
women who know how to play poker.

51
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,617
That is a lame excuse.
It's a typical guy response.

52
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,786
Do you know how to play?

53
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,219
No.

54
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:54,350
-But you could teach us.
-No.

55
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:03,660
Okay, so now we draw cards.

56
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,968
So I wouldn't need any.
I have a straight.

57
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:12,110
-Oh, good for you!
-Congratulations!

58
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:18,381
-Pheebs, how many do you want?
-I just need two.

59
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:22,179
The 10 of spades and the 6 of clubs.

60
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,689
-No, you can't
-I have the 10 of spades! Here.

61
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,485
Thanks!

62
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:34,492
-No, you can't do that.
-Don't need them. I'm going for fours.

63
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,396
Oh, you're

64
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,004
You're going for fours.
Chandler, could you? Thanks, man.

65
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,173
Here we go.

66
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,475
We've got salmon roulettes
and crudites.

67
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,515
What are you doing?

68
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,554
In poker, there's no food
with more than one syllable.

69
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:01,818
It's got to be like chips
or dip or pretz

70
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:08,261
I hope you'll let it slide just
this once. I was all out of "pretz."

71
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:10,998
Now the dealer

72
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,935
We got it. Let's play for real.
High stakes. Big bucks!

73
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:20,169
You sure? Phoebe just threw away two
jacks because they didn't look happy.

74
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,785
But I'm ready. So just deal.

75
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:30,012
Okay, last-minute lesson!
Joey....

76
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,656
Three.

77
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:32,847
Eight.

78
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,623
Eight. Three.
All right, very good.

79
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,531
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

80
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,262
Joey had two fives showing,
so for you to raise was

81
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,167
Yes?

82
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,638
Downright gutsy.

83
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,971
-I see, so you were lying.
-About what?

84
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,345
-About how good your cards were.
-I was bluffing.

85
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,584
And what is bluffing?

86
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,821
Is it not another word for lying?

87
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:13,226
Sorry to break up this party, but I've
got to go fax resumes before work.

88
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,901
-We've got to settle.
-Settle what?

89
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,165
The Jamestown colony of Virginia.

90
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,969
See, King George is giving us
the land....

91
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:31,877
-The game, Rachel. You owe us money.
-Right.

92
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:35,747
It's their first time.
Let's forget about the money.

93
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,583
Hell, no. We'll pay!

94
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,158
Monica, I had another
answer all ready.

95
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,124
And you know what?
We want a rematch.

96
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,893
That's fine with me.
Could use some money.

97
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:56,465
-You're enjoying this, aren't you?
-Well, yeah, I am.

98
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:01,107
So you get your ya-yas
by taking money from your friends.

99
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,980
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from KEA.

100
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,548
You have to put them together
yourself, but they cost less.

101
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,092
Look, this is poker.
I play to win.

102
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,762
For me to win,
others have to lose.

103
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:21,491
If you're gonna play,
don't expect me to be nice.

104
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,636
Because once those cards are dealt....

105
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,337
Yeah?

106
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,180
I'm not a nice guy.

107
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,188
All right, let's eat.

108
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:53,229
Did you get that
from the "I Love Rachel Pizzeria"?

109
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,500
-You still on that?
-What was with that Black Bart speech?

110
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,070
"When I play poker,
I'm not a nice guy."

111
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,240
You're way off.

112
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:07,071
No, I don't think so,
because I think you love her!

113
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:12,512
No. I might have had feelings
for her at one time. Not anymore.

114
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,776
I just

115
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:17,319
Marcel! Where are you going
with that disk?

116
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:20,014
You are not putting that on again.

117
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:24,185
If you press that button,
you are in very big trouble.

118
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,655
You believe what a jerk
Ross was being?

119
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:01,390
-Yeah, I know.
-He can get really competitive.

120
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,302
What?

121
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,969
"Hello, kettle? This is Monica.
You're black!"

122
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,006
Please!

123
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,874
I'm not as bad as Ross.

124
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,540
I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?

125
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,849
That wasn't an incident.

126
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:26,491
I was gesturing and the plate
slipped out of my hand.

127
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,797
-I got an interview!
-You're kidding! Where?

128
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,764
Saks Fifth Avenue.

129
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,664
Oh, Rachel!

130
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,596
It's like the mother ship
is calling you home.

131
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,071
-What's the job?
-Assistant buyer.

132
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,084
I would be shopping!

133
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,654
For a living!

134
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,949
That's Aunt lris. She's been
playing poker since she was 5.

135
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,130
You've got to listen
to every word she says.

136
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,532
-ls Tony Randall dead?
-I don't think so.

137
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:12,397
-He may be now. I hit him with my car.
-My God, really?

138
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:16,063
No, that's bluffing.
Lesson number one.

139
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:22,938
Let me tell you something. Everything
you hear at a poker game is pure crap!

140
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,640
-Nice earrings.
-Thank you.

141
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:32,654
-Girls, sit down.
-Aunt lris, this is Phoebe and Rachel.

142
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,760
Listen, I'm parked at a meter.
Let's do it. Okay?

143
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,098
We'll start with five-card draw.

144
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:46,238
Then we'll go into the studs and the
hold 'ems. I talked to Cousin Nathan.

145
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,897
Don't touch the cards
when somebody is dealing.

146
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,705
How is Nathan?

147
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:59,476
Now he thinks he's a man
in a woman's body.

148
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:02,779
Don't you mean
a woman in a man's body?

149
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,452
It should be so simple.

150
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:19,471
Ross, could we please listen
to anything else?

151
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,572
All right.

152
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,683
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.

153
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,632
Hi. Guys, guess what?

154
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:52,668
The fifth dentist caved, and now
they're all recommending Trident?

155
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,736
No, the interview!

156
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,047
Unbelievable!
She absolutely loved me.

157
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,152
We talked for over two hours.
We've the same taste in clothes.

158
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,788
And I went to camp with her cousin.

159
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,450
-The job is perfect! I can do this.
-That's great!

160
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:19,757
-Then she told a funny story.
-Great, tell us and we'll laugh.

161
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,990
Let's play poker!

162
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:27,929
Listen, we talked about it and
if you don't wanna play, it's okay.

163
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:33,077
Yes, we can play some other game.
Like Pictionary?

164
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,245
Very funny.

165
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:40,475
-But we'd like to try poker again.
-Yes, I think we should.

166
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:46,386
-Do you want me to shuffle those?
-That's okay, I'm gonna give it a go.

167
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,226
So Pheebs owes $7. 50.
Monica owes $10.00.

168
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,429
And Rachel, you owe 1 5 big ones!

169
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:07,610
Thanks for teaching us Cross-Eyed
Mary. We gotta play that other way.

170
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,349
All right, here's my $7.50.
But this money is cursed.

171
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,179
-What?
-I cursed it!

172
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,389
Now bad things will happen
to the spender.

173
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,560
I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.

174
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,997
This way, I can split them up
with a movie.

175
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,501
So that just leaves the big Greene
poker machine, who owes 1 5.

176
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,566
Could you be any smugger?

177
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:40,370
Let's see. Rach, I'm opening up
a new art gallery...

178
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:45,607
...and I could sure use the portraits
of Lincoln and Hamilton.

179
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:51,283
It's so typical.
"I'm a man! I have a penis!

180
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,688
I have to win money
to exert my power over women!"

181
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,288
This isn't over.

182
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,693
We'll play you again.
We'll win. You'll lose.

183
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,632
You'll beg. We'll laugh.

184
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:11,071
We'll take every last dime you have.
And you'll hate yourselves forever!

185
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,339
Kind of stepped on
my point there, Mon.

186
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,949
I can't believe you lost!
How much did they take?

187
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,052
Like 30 bucks.

188
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,950
-I'll give you that money back.
-Really?

189
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:29,059
No, I'm bluffing!
You guys haven't learned crap!

190
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,425
-Hand me the cards!
-Can l?

191
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,430
Yes!

192
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:48,504
Wanna give us your money now? We can
skip the formality of really playing.

193
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:53,048
No, that's fine. We'll see who has
the last laugh, monkey boy.

194
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,118
Done with chitchat?
Ready for serious poker?

195
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:03,421
You guys, look! The one-eyed jack
follows me wherever I go.

196
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,562
Right. Serious poker.

197
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:11,464
-Mon, got any more of those salmon?
-You want to eat or play poker?

198
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,833
-Where are you going?
-To the bathroom.

199
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,838
Want to go to the bathroom
or play poker?

200
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,670
Go to the bathroom.

201
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,641
-Well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
-No!

202
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,753
I'm waiting to hear from that job.
The store closes at 9:00. Eat then.

203
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:34,153
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic Tac
to hold me over.

204
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,194
All right. Cincinnati. No blinds.
Everybody, ante.

205
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,387
Yes!

206
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,534
Or no.

207
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:50,501
-All right! Your money's mine, Greene.
-Your fly's open, Geller.

208
00:16:56,415 --> 00:17:02,411
You know what I just realized?
Joker is poker with a "J"!

209
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,224
Coincidence?

210
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:11,395
That's jo-incidence with a "C"!

211
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:25,205
-Phoebe?
-Yeah, I'm out.

212
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,873
-I'm in.
-Me too.

213
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,946
Me too.
What do you got?

214
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:36,350
You better hop out of the shower,
because I got a flush.

215
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,885
Well, well, well!

216
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,927
Hop back in, bucko,
because I got four sixes!

217
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:50,192
I got four sixes! I won!
I actually won! Oh, my God!

218
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,496
You know what?
I'll make a little Ross pile.

219
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:54,865
Look!

220
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:59,977
I think that one was Ross'.
And I think that one was Ross'.

221
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,248
Well, I have got your money
And you'll never see it

222
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,715
And your fly's still open

223
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,921
I made you look

224
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,385
-I'm in.
-I couldn't be in-er.

225
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,188
Monica, in or out?

226
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,690
I hate this game!

227
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,973
Joey, your bet.

228
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:33,406
I fold like a hooker
who got hit in the stomach...

229
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,648
... by a fat guy
with sores on his face.

230
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,380
I'm out.

231
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:46,084
-Ross?
-I'm very in.

232
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,989
-Chandler?
-Couldn't be more out.

233
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,992
Me too. Rachel?

234
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:58,393
I will see you and I'll raise you.
Do you wanna waste another buck?

235
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,102
No, not this time.
What did you have?

236
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,207
-I'm not telling.
-Show them.

237
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,467
-No.
-Show them!

238
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,773
-Get your hands out of there!
-I've had dates like this.

239
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,044
Boy, you really can't stand
to lose, can you?

240
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,587
Your whole face is getting red.
Veins popping out of your temple!

241
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,159
Plus, that shirt doesn't really
match those pants.

242
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,299
-I'm not losing.
-You're definitely losing.

243
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,471
Hello. Rachel Greene.

244
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,207
Excuse me. It's about the job!

245
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,142
Barbara, hi! How are you?

246
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,249
No, I understand.

247
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:54,021
Come on. No, I'm fine.
Don't be silly. Yeah.

248
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:57,992
But if anything else
opens up, please

249
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,824
Hello?

250
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,177
Sorry, Rach.

251
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,620
There's gonna be lots
of other stuff.

252
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,345
Okay.

253
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,190
Where were we?

254
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:33,760
Five-card draw. Jacks are better.
Nothing wild. Everybody, ante.

255
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:39,366
-Look, Rach, we don't have to do this.
-Yes, we do.

256
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,766
-All right. Check.
-Check.

257
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:47,270
-I'm in for 50 cents.
-Call.

258
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,276
I'm in.

259
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:52,275
I see your 50 cents...

260
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,976
...and I raise you $5.

261
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,154
I thought it was a 50-cent limit.

262
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,293
I just lost a job,
I'd like to raise it $5.

263
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,962
Does anyone have
a problem with that?

264
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,725
-Not at all.
-No.

265
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,427
Loser?

266
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:25,181
-No, I fold.
-What do you mean, you fold?

267
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:29,820
I thought that, "Once the cards
are dealt, I'm not a nice guy."

268
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,649
Were you just full of it?

269
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:46,829
I'm in.

270
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,834
-How many do you want?
-One.

271
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,277
Dealer takes two.

272
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,580
-What do you bet?
-I bet $2.

273
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,117
Okay. I see your $2...

274
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,050
...and I raise you...

275
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,019
... 20.

276
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,695
I see your $20...

277
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,791
... raise you $25.

278
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,370
I see your $25
and Monica, get my purse.

279
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,711
Rachel, there's nothing in it.

280
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,278
Okay, then get me your purse.

281
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:46,196
-Here you go. Good luck!
-Thank you.

282
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,259
I saw your $25 and I raise you...

283
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,793
...seven.

284
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,930
teen!

285
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,506
Joey, I'm a little shy.

286
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,047
That's okay, Ross. You can ask me.

287
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,961
-What do you need?
-1 5.

288
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,096
-Here's 10.
-I got 5.

289
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,390
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

290
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,131
I am calling your 1 7.

291
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,168
What do you got?

292
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,842
Full house.

293
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,851
You got me.

294
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:01,301
-That's tough to beat.
-I thought we had it!

295
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:05,408
When you don't have the cards,
you don't have the cards.

296
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,044
But look how happy she is.

297
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,824
-Airmail.
-Airplane. Airport. Airport '75!

298
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:24,257
Airport '77! Airport '79!

299
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,455
Time's up!

300
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,293
Bye Bye Birdie!

301
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,229
That's a bird?

302
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,770
That's a bird!

303
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,943
Okay, it's my turn.

304
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:41,878
Go!

305
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,516
Bean! Bean!

306
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,421
The Unbearable Lightness of Being!

307
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,387
That you get?

308
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,858
That you get?!
