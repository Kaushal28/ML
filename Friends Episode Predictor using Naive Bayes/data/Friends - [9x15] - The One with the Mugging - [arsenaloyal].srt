1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:04,498
Guys! Guys! I've got great
news. Guess what.

2
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:07,069
-Monica's pregnant!
-ReaIIy?

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,602
Let's get past the moment.

4
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:13,639
-What's your news?
-Thank you.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,071
I got a job in advertising.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,281
Honey, that's incredibIe!

7
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:22,751
Gosh, what's the pay Iike?

8
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,521
Oh, come on, peopIe.

9
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,921
If I don't know who makes the most...

10
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:32,428
...how do I know who
I Iike the most? Hi, Joey.

11
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,935
It pays nothing. It's an internship.

12
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,001
We have interns at <i>Days of Our Lives</i>.

13
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,264
Right. So it'II be the same,
except Iess sex with you.

14
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,369
What do you think they'II
have you do there?

15
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,740
It's a training program, but they
hire the peopIe they Iike.

16
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,883
-That's great!
-There's gonna be some grunt work...

17
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,681
...which wiII stink. A grown man
getting peopIe coffee is humiIiating.

18
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,560
HumiIiating and nobIe.

19
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,028
Thank you.

20
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,859
You know, if I didn't
aIready have a job...

21
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,127
...I wouId've been good in advertising.

22
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:13,032
Ross, you did not come up with:
''Got MiIk?''

23
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,207
Yes, I did! I did!

24
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,906
I shouId've written it down.

25
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,595
Where's ChandIer? I want to wish
him good Iuck on his first day.

26
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,268
And I smeIIed bacon.

27
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,666
-He just Ieft.
-Who did?

28
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,976
Joey, you're never gonna
beIieve it! She caIIed!

29
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,735
-She did?
-You got it!

30
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,540
-I did?
-What is she taIking about?

31
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,975
I don't know, but it sounds great!

32
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,311
Your agent caIIed.
You got that audition!

33
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,850
-With Leonard Hayes?
-Yes!

34
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,717
Oh, my God, that is great!
It's for a pIay on Broadway.

35
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:42,021
And in a reaI theater. Not that IittIe
one underneath the deIi Iike Iast time.

36
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,854
-Is it a good pIay?
-It must be.

37
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,625
I read it and didn't
understand a singIe word!

38
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,530
-Leonard Hayes is starring in it.
-Yeah, and directing.

39
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,204
He was so good in
that movie of <i>Macbeth</i>.

40
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:57,206
-You saw that?
-No, but I saw the previews.

41
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,574
They pIayed it right before <i>Jackass</i>.

42
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,146
-He's done some amazing work.
-Oh, yeah.

43
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,511
I Ioved him in those phone commerciaIs.

44
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,587
When the monkey hits him in the face
with the giant rubber phone....

45
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,687
Maybe the monkey
wiII be at the audition.

46
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:15,657
Don't make me more nervous
than I aIready am!

47
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,368
-Good morning.
-Can I get you a cup of coffee, sir?

48
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,509
Oh, no, no. I'm an intern,
just Iike you guys.

49
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:35,239
Except for the tie, the briefcase
and the fact that I can rent a car.

50
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,245
SeriousIy, you're an intern?

51
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,546
I'm heading in a new career direction
and you gotta start at the bottom.

52
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,212
Dude.

53
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:49,857
I know I'm a IittIe oIder than you guys,
but it's not Iike I'm Bob Hope.

54
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,892
The comedian. USO.

55
00:03:56,536 --> 00:04:00,028
It's U.S.A., sir.

56
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,938
This is Joey Tribbiani.
Joey, these are the producers.

57
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,084
And as you probabIy aIready
know, this is Leonard Hayes.

58
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:21,250
It is so amazing to meet you.
I am such a big fan of your work.

59
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,294
I've been bIessed with
a Iot of great roIes.

60
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:29,634
TeII me about it, huh?
''UnIimited nights and weekends!''

61
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:34,102
Are you making fun of me?
Because I am not a seIIout.

62
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,969
I didn't do it for money.
I beIieve in those phones!

63
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:41,512
I aImost Iost a cousin because
of bad wireIess service.

64
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:45,844
No, I wasn't making fun of you. I think
you were great in those commerciaIs.

65
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,350
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

66
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,614
WeII, I do bring a certain
credibiIity to the roIe.

67
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,989
Are you kidding? When they shoot
you out of that cannon--

68
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,492
''Hang up that phone!''

69
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,828
-One take.
-Wow.

70
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,027
-So shaII we read?
-Oh, yeah, sure.

71
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:09,265
Top of Act 2. This is my entrance.
You got it?

72
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,440
What the heII are you stiII doing here?

73
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,417
-I think you know.
-Bastard!

74
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,112
I am what you made me.
You know what? I couId go right now.

75
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,986
-Go! Go!
-I can't.

76
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,857
Oh, I want to, Long Pause...

77
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,159
...but I can't.

78
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:42,065
So sorry. You're not supposed
to say ''Iong pause.''

79
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,147
Oh! Oh, I thought that was your
character's name. You know?

80
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:51,806
I thought you were, Iike, an Indian
or something, you know, with the....

81
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:57,683
No. Thank you so much for coming in.
We appreciate it. Thank you.

82
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,688
You don't want me to do it again?

83
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,486
-I couId do an accent.
-No.

84
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:06,724
You know, Southern.
''I couId go right now, mon!'' Huh?

85
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,667
My God in heaven.

86
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:17,108
Joey, hang on. Leonard, can
we taIk to you for a moment?

87
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:23,476
Yes? You've got to be kidding.
He can't act.

88
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,378
I don't care if you think he's hot.

89
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:30,215
If you want to sIeep with him,
do it on your own time. This is a pIay.

90
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,685
If you insist on this...

91
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,884
...I wiII caII my agent so fast...

92
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,895
...on a ceII phone connection so cIear,
he's gonna think I'm next door!

93
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:45,295
Hi, thank you so much for
whispering for my benefit.

94
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,941
TeII me what I did wrong. I'd Iove to
work on it and try it again for you.

95
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,304
And aIso, how you doing?

96
00:06:55,782 --> 00:07:00,276
Give me another chance.
I reaIIy want to get better. PIease?

97
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,051
If you want to come back today...

98
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,952
-...here are my notes. Ready?
-Yeah.

99
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:11,893
-You're in your head. Thinking too much.
-I reaIIy doubt that.

100
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,795
No, no. It's that you're not
connected with anything in your body.

101
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,230
There's no urgency.
The scene is a struggIe.

102
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,931
It's a race.
AIso, what you did was horizontaI.

103
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,043
Don't be afraid to expIore the verticaI.

104
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:30,472
And don't Iearn the words.
Let the words Iearn you.

105
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,346
CouIdn't I just sIeep with the producer?

106
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,128
Hey, do you want to go
to dinner tonight?

107
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,138
I can't. I've got a date
with that waitress, Katie.

108
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,471
I know we've onIy gone out,
Iike, twice, but I don't know...

109
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:03,581
-...I have a good feeIing about her.
-Oh, I hear divorce beIIs.

110
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,478
Give me your waIIets,
and there won't be a probIem.

111
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,415
-What?
-I have a gun.

112
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,817
Okay, reIax, Phoebe.
Just stay caIm.

113
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,227
Oh, my God, I can't find my waIIet!

114
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,894
-AII right, Iady, now give me your purse.
-No.

115
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:26,197
What do you mean ''no''? I knew you'd
be my death, Phoebe Buffay!

116
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,906
-LoweII, is that you?
-Phoebe?

117
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:34,773
-Oh, my God!
-UnbeIievabIe! Oh, my God!

118
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:39,407
I'm sorry. Ross, this is my oId friend,
LoweII, from the streets!

119
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,019
-LoweII, Ross.
-Ross, nice to meet you.

120
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,348
Yeah, a reaI pIeasure.

121
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:48,754
It's been so Iong! Oh, so Iong.

122
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:52,419
-I can't beIieve you're stiII doing this.
-I know. But I quit smoking.

123
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,395
Good for you.

124
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,262
You Iook Iike you're doing weII.

125
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,063
I guess your mugging days
are behind you.

126
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,605
Oh, my God.
Phoebe, you used to mug peopIe?

127
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,045
Excuse me, Ross,
oId friends catching up.

128
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,909
-How'd the audition go?
-They want to see me again, but...

129
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,818
...Leonard Hayes did not Iike me.

130
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:22,654
-What happened?
-He said I wasn't urgent enough.

131
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:28,664
Everything I did was horizontaI,
and I shouId be more verticaI.

132
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:34,464
-He said that I shouId think Iess.
-WeII, so far so good.

133
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,801
Honey, I'm oId!

134
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,039
I didn't know you were
coming home for Iunch.

135
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:43,272
-Can I get you anything?
-Sure, a tube of PoIident?

136
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,241
Some Depends?

137
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,819
Birthday wishes from WiIIard Scott.

138
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,546
What's wrong?

139
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,351
I am so much oIder than these other
interns. I can't compete with them.

140
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,392
So you're a IittIe oIder.

141
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:59,429
Look at the positive.
You have aII this Iife experience.

142
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:05,195
Yes, but I don't think Iife experience
is gonna heIp me with these.

143
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:11,309
Wow! It's Iike they're on fire!

144
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,239
-What are they?
-Prototype sneakers.

145
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,908
I need ideas on how to seII them.
Which I can't do...

146
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,715
...because no seIf-respecting
aduIt wouId ever wear these.

147
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,515
I'II give you $500 for them.

148
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,621
-What am I supposed to do?
-Come on, sneakers are easy.

149
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,495
-You wear them aII the time.
-They're not caIIed sneakers anymore.

150
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:42,608
They're caIIed ''kicks'' or ''skids.''
I think I heard somebody say ''sIorps.''

151
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,909
They've got wheeIs that pop out from
the bottom so you can roII around...

152
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,481
...because apparentIy
waIking is too much exercise.

153
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:56,054
''Kids! Kids! RoII your
way to chiIdhood obesity!''

154
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:01,154
Kids today have such
an easier time getting fat.

155
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,858
WouId you heIp me try to seII these?

156
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:11,093
Okay. Have you considered
using a girI with huge knockers?

157
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,769
That's not what they're Iooking for.

158
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,498
Hey, that wouId work on me.

159
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,735
Why do you think I buy
Mrs. Butterworth's?

160
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,753
You'II never guess what just happened.

161
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,586
-Phoebe and I got mugged!
-Are you okay?

162
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,388
Yeah. Phoebe knew the mugger.

163
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,629
How do you know a mugger?

164
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:44,098
I'm sorry, I have friends
outside the six of us.

165
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,398
Know how she knew him?
Because Phoebe used to mug peopIe.

166
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,301
SeriousIy?

167
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:53,002
WeII, I'm not proud of it,
but, you know...

168
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:58,412
...when I was Iiving on the street and
I needed money for food and stuff....

169
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:02,485
-That is awfuI.
-I wasn't rich Iike you guys, okay?

170
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:06,716
I didn't eat goId and have a fIying pony.

171
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,055
I had a hard Iife.
My mother was kiIIed by a drug deaIer.

172
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:16,030
-Your mother kiIIed herseIf.
-She was a drug deaIer.

173
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:21,829
It was a good thing she knew him.
I was about to do some serious damage.

174
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,440
Okay.

175
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,069
This must have brought back
some bad memories for you, Ross.

176
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,078
-Why?
-Ross was mugged as a kid.

177
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,548
-You were?
-Yeah. And it was pretty traumatic.

178
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,881
It was outside St. Mark's Comics.

179
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:42,050
I was minding my business, seeing what
kind of troubIe Spider-Man was into.

180
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,320
Wonder Woman.

181
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,591
Anyway, I was heading
towards this bakery...

182
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:52,466
...to pick up a coupIe of dozen
Iinzer tortes for someone...

183
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,698
...when out of nowhere, this thug
with a pipe jumps out and says:

184
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,175
-''Give me your money, punk!''
-Oh, my God.

185
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,213
I know. And the worst part
was, they took my backpack...

186
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:09,218
...which had aII the originaI artwork I did
for my own comic book, <i>Science Boy</i>.

187
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,589
Oh, yeah! What was
his super power again?

188
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,693
A super-human thirst for knowIedge.

189
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,421
I better get to cIass.

190
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,795
Are there any more of your
friends I shouId Iook out for?

191
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,095
No. ActuaIIy, you might want to stay
away from Jane Street.

192
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:30,003
That's where Stabby Joe works.

193
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,778
-I think we have a probIem here.
-What?

194
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:41,112
Back in my mugging days,
I worked St. Mark's Comics.

195
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:45,815
-Yeah?
-A pipe was my weapon of choice...

196
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,153
...and preteen, comic-book nerds
were my meat.

197
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,021
So?

198
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,667
There was one kid who had
a sticker on his backpack that said:

199
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,096
-''GeoIogy rocks!''
-''GeoIogy rocks!''

200
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,142
-Oh, my God!
-I know! I mugged Ross!

201
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,150
-You're Iate.
-I know. I'm sorry.

202
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,047
But can I just run to the bathroom?

203
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:18,279
-No. Leonard doesn't wait.
-But I am bursting with Yoo-hoo!

204
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,152
Joey, here we go!
Let's go. Very quickIy.

205
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,727
-I reaIIy need--
-We must go now, quickIy.

206
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,990
-Yeah. Yes, sir.
-Ready?

207
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,736
-What the heII are you stiII doing here?
-I think you know!

208
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:37,508
-Oh, you sick bastard!
-I am what you made me! Know what?

209
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,406
-What?
-I couId go right now.

210
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:48,451
-Then go. Go!
-Oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!

211
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,853
Cut. That was good!

212
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:57,553
-Very good. You did everything I asked.
-I did?

213
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,325
Yes. PIus which, you've got this,
I don't know, this squirmy quaIity...

214
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,462
...you bring to the character
I couIdn't have imagined.

215
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,193
Here's what we're gonna do:

216
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,897
Come back tomorrow
for the finaI caIIbacks.

217
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,202
Do aII of this, what you got
going now. But you know what?

218
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,936
More. More. Can you do that?

219
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:18,447
Sure. I don't have time to say
thank you because I reaIIy gotta go!

220
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,878
Look at that! StiII in character.
I Iike him.

221
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:28,857
I pIant seeds. I can't expIain it.
I don't know.

222
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,863
-Hey. What are you doing?
-Putting on the sneakers...

223
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,730
...to get in the young mindset,
see if it sparks anything.

224
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,634
-Oh, anything yet?
-Yes, how's this?

225
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:46,870
''They're so uncomfortabIe, it's Iike
getting kicked in the nuts for your feet.''

226
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,086
You're probabIy wondering
what I'm doing.

227
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,885
No, that seems about right.

228
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:10,699
Yesterday at my audition, I had to pee.
ApparentIy, that makes me a good actor.

229
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,895
I got a caIIback, so I'm drinking
everything. Oh, by the way...

230
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,405
...that eggnog in our fridge was great!

231
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:21,136
-Joey, that was formuIa.
-We gotta get more of that.

232
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:27,449
These aren't haIf bad. You shouId
suggest these to RaIph Lauren.

233
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:32,784
Okay, first of aII, that's stupid.
Second, I'm not aIIowed to taIk to RaIph.

234
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:38,220
AII right. I feeI younger aIready.

235
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:43,457
Yeah, I think I broke my hip.

236
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,327
-Hey, you!
-Hey.

237
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,063
Hey. How was cIass?

238
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,002
No one asks me that. What's wrong?

239
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,204
-Nothing. I reaIIy want to know.
-Oh.

240
00:16:56,382 --> 00:17:00,751
WeII, there was actuaIIy a rather IiveIy
discussion about the PIeistocene--

241
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,477
AII right, nothing is worth this.

242
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,386
I have a confession to make.

243
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,585
Okay, you know that girI that
mugged you when you were a kid?

244
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:16,492
What are you taIking about?
It wasn't a girI. It was this huge dude.

245
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:20,866
He had a pitchfork and a sword.

246
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,599
You don't have to Iie anymore.
I know that it was a 1 4-year-oId girI.

247
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,335
-No, it wasn't.
-Yes, it was.

248
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,710
You don't think I wouId have defended
myseIf against a 1 4-year-oId--?

249
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,647
-''Give me your money, punk!''
-Oh, my God, it was you!

250
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:41,125
I can't beIieve it. You mugged me?

251
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,352
Yeah. And I'm so, so sorry, Ross.
I'm sorry.

252
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,295
But, you know, if you think
about it, it's kind of neat.

253
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:54,132
I mean, weII, it's just that I've
aIways feIt kind of Iike an outsider.

254
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:57,833
You know, the rest of you have
connections that go way back...

255
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,640
...and, you know, now you
and I have a great one.

256
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,580
It's not the best!

257
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,884
I know. PIease forgive me.
I don't know what to say.

258
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,820
There's nothing you can say! That was
the most humiIiating thing ever.

259
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:17,223
-Even more humiIiating than--
-Let's not do this!

260
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:24,063
And then, at the end of the commerciaI,
the girIs get out of the hot tub...

261
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,704
...and start making
out with each other.

262
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,275
That's interesting.

263
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:35,336
Just one thought:
You didn't mention the shoes.

264
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,481
Who's next? ChandIer.

265
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,477
You start with a guy
putting on the shoes.

266
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,681
-He's about my age.
-Your age?

267
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,253
He's roIIing down the street
and he starts to Iose controI.

268
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,990
Maybe he faIIs.
Maybe he hurts himseIf.

269
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,864
Just then, a kid comes fIying
by wearing the shoes.

270
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,631
He jumps over the oId guy and Iaughs.
And the Iine reads:

271
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,537
''Not suitabIe for aduIts.''

272
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,369
-WeII, ChandIer, that's great.
-Thank you, sir.

273
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:13,211
Or, man who's two
years younger than me.

274
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:18,620
You see, that has a cIear seIIing point.
It appeaIs to our key demographic.

275
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,782
-How did you come up with that?
-I don't know! I don't know!

276
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,660
I was just trying to get into a young
mindset, and stuff started to fIow.

277
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,536
-That is great. Good work.
-Thank you.

278
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,400
We'II see aII of you tomorrow.

279
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,186
The coId weather hurts my hip.

280
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:58,753
Hey, Ross. I know you're stiII mad at
me, but can I just taIk to you for a sec?

281
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:03,594
Sure, go ahead. Oh, sorry.
Sure, go ahead.

282
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,930
I just reaIIy wanted to apoIogize again.

283
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:11,940
And aIso show you something
I think you'II find very exciting.

284
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:17,581
Oh, my God! ''Crap from the street!''

285
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,314
Look, Ross. In this box...

286
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:29,085
...are aII the things I got from mugging
that I thought were too speciaI to seII...

287
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,196
...or smoke.

288
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,723
Anyway, I was Iooking
through it, and I found...

289
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,198
...<i>Science Boy.</i>

290
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,970
Oh, my God!

291
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,509
I never thought I'd see this again.

292
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,038
It's aII here!

293
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,749
What made you save
it aII these years?

294
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,422
I guess I just thought
it was reaIIy good.

295
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,990
And maybe it wouId be
worth something one day.

296
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,319
You reaIIy thought <i>Science Boy</i>
was worth saving?

297
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,627
Yeah. But you shouId know I aIso have a
jar of VaseIine and a cat skuII in here.

298
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:16,330
StiII, this is amazing!

299
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,442
Oh, my God. Thank you, Phoebe.

300
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:23,080
You're weIcome. Thank you for
Science Boy. I Iearned a Iot from him.

301
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,172
You're weIcome.

302
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,655
Wait a minute.
Did you add something to him?

303
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,188
Oh, yeah.

304
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,916
You see, the way you drew him...

305
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:38,028
...there was no way
he was ever gonna get Gravity GirI.

306
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:42,090
He Iooked Iike a Ken doII in those tights.

307
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,761
What's that? What are you...?

308
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,673
''Is that a beaker
or are you happy to see me?''

309
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,407
I don't get it.

310
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:03,345
-I need an answer!
-I can't teII you something I don't know.

311
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,422
-You know!
-I don't know!

312
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:11,529
-I need an answer now!
-You want an answer? The answer is....

313
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,839
She never Ioved me.
She onIy Ioved you.

314
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,736
You knew this aII aIong
and you never toId me?

315
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:30,006
I can never forgive you, or myseIf. I have
