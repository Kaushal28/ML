1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,294
Aren't you excited we're going
on our honeymoon?

2
00:00:05,502 --> 00:00:06,754
Yeah, I am.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,634
That's right, get it out of your system
while we're alone.

4
00:00:13,593 --> 00:00:17,472
-Hey. We came to say goodbye.
-Yeah. Have a great honeymoon.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,474
-Thanks.
-I better go pack.

6
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:23,311
No, I already packed. The only thing
I couldn't find, though, was your Speedo.

7
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,151
Speedo? I don't have a Speedo.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,698
I'm gonna go pack my regular,
long bathing suit.

9
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:40,411
Good, you're still here! I wanted
to tell you to have a good honeymoon.

10
00:00:40,578 --> 00:00:42,122
Thank you!

11
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:46,501
And I also wanted you guys to know
that I am telling the father today.

12
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:52,590
What? What?

13
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:57,721
-We know it's Ross.
-How? How do you know?

14
00:00:57,887 --> 00:01:00,891
It was his sweater. But, oh, my God!

15
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:05,395
I so wanted Ross to know first.
But I am so relieved that you guys know!

16
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:08,064
That is so great. And I'm gonna be
your baby's aunt!

17
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,440
I know.

18
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:11,192
Me too!

19
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:14,571
And I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.

20
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:19,533
-You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
-Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.

21
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:26,624
So now that you all know, you can help me.
Give me some advice on how to tell Ross.

22
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,126
What were you gonna say?

23
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:32,671
I was gonna tell him that I'm gonna have it,
and he can be as involved as he wants.

24
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:34,548
Well, that sounds good.

25
00:01:34,757 --> 00:01:39,219
Yeah, but, you know, how do I start?
I mean, what's the first thing that I say?

26
00:01:42,806 --> 00:01:46,268
-Okay, great. Thanks.
-Hey, good luck.

27
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:48,145
Yeah, bye.

28
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:50,898
Hey, what was that all about?

29
00:01:51,106 --> 00:01:55,402
Guess there's no harm in telling you now.
Rachel and Ross are going to have a baby.

30
00:01:55,569 --> 00:02:01,241
What?! I didn't even know that..!
Why didn't you tell me?

31
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,119
Why am I talking like this?

32
00:02:05,662 --> 00:02:09,082
-I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
-What?!

33
00:02:11,377 --> 00:02:12,794
What?!

34
00:02:13,544 --> 00:02:16,798
I am an excellent secret-keeper.
I have kept all our secrets.

35
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:19,718
-What secrets?
-No, no, Joey.

36
00:02:19,884 --> 00:02:23,930
I'm not gonna tell you, because
I am an excellent secret-keeper.

37
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:30,102
-You'll tell me later?
-You already know.

38
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:15,230
It's so romantic to send people off
on their honeymoon.

39
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:19,776
You know, Monica and Chandler are
married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby.

40
00:03:19,943 --> 00:03:25,365
-Maybe you and I should do something.
-All in good time, my love. All in good time.

41
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:31,914
Shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment.
Well, you can let me in later, right?

42
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,583
No, I don't have a key.
They took mine to give to you.

43
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:39,838
-What? They took mine to give to you.
-Why would they take away our keys?

44
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:41,506
Maybe they don't trust us.

45
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:44,593
They let me keep my key the last time
they were out of town.

46
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,639
The time you broke the ketchup bottle
and cleaned it with Monica's guest towels?

47
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:52,726
-Hey, I washed those.
-No, you didn't.

48
00:03:52,893 --> 00:03:55,186
Yeah, that didn't sound like me.

49
00:03:56,103 --> 00:04:00,399
-What will I do? I really need my guitar.
-I have stuff in there too.

50
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:05,112
-What stuff?
-Monica's chicken parm. I'll take care of it.

51
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:09,075
Hey, Mr. Treeger? It's Joey Tribbiani.

52
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:13,579
Listen, I need to get into Monica and
Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency!

53
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,375
Gas leak. Oh, and bring garlic bread.

54
00:04:21,587 --> 00:04:24,090
-Hey, did Monica and Chandler take off yet?
-Yeah.

55
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:29,386
Damn. They left without my pass to the
Nassau Fossil and Natural History Museum.

56
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:32,389
There goes the honeymoon.

57
00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:35,100
-Did Rachel find you?
-No, why?

58
00:04:35,684 --> 00:04:37,937
She was looking for you.

59
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:41,064
Well, I guess I'll catch up
with her later.

60
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:46,570
-She really wanted to talk to you now.
-Yeah, it seemed pretty important.

61
00:04:48,947 --> 00:04:50,575
Oh, no.

62
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:52,159
What?

63
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,704
I think I might know what this is about.

64
00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:59,082
Really?

65
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:04,797
Yeah. We promised we weren't
gonna tell anybody this, but..

66
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:09,759
About a month ago,
Rachel and I slept together.

67
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:11,803
And?

68
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:18,810
Wow, I thought you'd be
a little more shocked.

69
00:05:19,394 --> 00:05:21,897
Oh, sorry. And?!

70
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:30,154
Well, we said we'd just do it
that one time..

71
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:34,200
but now I think she may wanna
start things up again.

72
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,078
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.

73
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:43,041
-Why? What else could it be?
-Oh, wow, I don't feel well.

74
00:05:44,836 --> 00:05:47,963
I'm telling you, that's what it is.

75
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:52,259
No wonder she was looking at me
all funny during the wedding.

76
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,429
She didn't say anything to you?

77
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:58,307
-Maybe it's something you ate.
-Could be, yeah.

78
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:03,062
-Please, just go and talk to Rachel.
-Yeah, I guess I should.

79
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,942
Man, you know what I have to realize?

80
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,904
Maybe I'm not the type of guy
women can have just one night with.

81
00:06:13,864 --> 00:06:18,660
You know, they always seem
to want a little bit more.

82
00:06:20,203 --> 00:06:22,330
I should remember that.

83
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:33,633
Next.

84
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:38,138
-They're kissing. Let's just go around them.
-Leave them alone. They're in love.

85
00:06:38,305 --> 00:06:41,725
I'm in love too. But
in an orderly fashion.

86
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:43,268
Next.

87
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:47,231
Hi. Can you do that and walk?
Because she said, "Next."

88
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:52,360
Sorry, we didn't hear you.
We're on our honeymoon.

89
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:58,574
Let me see what I can do. There
are some first-class seats available.

90
00:06:58,741 --> 00:07:02,370
They bumped them up to first class
because they're on their honeymoon!

91
00:07:02,578 --> 00:07:07,041
-Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.
-We are on our honeymoon.

92
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,002
Grab my ass.

93
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,422
-Next.
-Hi. Sorry, I almost didn't hear you.

94
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,969
You know, I'm just so in love with my
new husband. We're on our honeymoon.

95
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:20,012
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

96
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:25,392
Okay, Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J,
and Mrs. Bing, you're in 25K.

97
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:30,232
We're on our honeymoon, so can you do
your little thing and bump us to first class?

98
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,193
I'm sorry, all the first-class seats are
taken. That couple got the last two.

99
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:40,073
See? If we'd gone around them like I said,
she'd have given us those tickets! Damn it!

100
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:44,078
25J and K, any chance
those aren't together?

101
00:07:52,378 --> 00:07:56,339
I still can't believe they took away my
key. I mean, you trust me with yours.

102
00:07:56,506 --> 00:07:59,092
Of course I do!
And I'm gonna get it back to you..

103
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:02,929
just as soon as they're done with it
at the key-shining place.

104
00:08:06,683 --> 00:08:08,852
-What the hell is that?
-I don't know.

105
00:08:09,935 --> 00:08:12,313
Treeger, what are you doing?

106
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,233
-You said there was a gas leak.
-Why not use your key?

107
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,861
By the time I found it on this thing,
the whole place might have exploded.

108
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:22,698
If that happens at another building
I manage, people will ask questions.

109
00:08:22,865 --> 00:08:24,534
Come on, hurry up!

110
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:29,872
Well, we could have done that.

111
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:36,170
Look at that! They're going
into the first-class lounge.

112
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:38,339
-Do you know what they have in there?
-No.

113
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:40,841
Me neither. We have to get in!

114
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,472
-Just act like you belong.
-Oh, my God! Oranges!

115
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:52,978
-Nice to see you again.
-Sir, may I see your tickets, please?

116
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:55,481
Yes, of course.

117
00:08:56,565 --> 00:08:59,151
Would you move your thumb?
I can't see the seat number.

118
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,404
That's all right.
I have it memorized. It's 1A.

119
00:09:05,074 --> 00:09:09,036
-Sir, this isn't a first-class ticket. I'm sorry.
-Apology accepted. Excuse us.

120
00:09:09,203 --> 00:09:13,541
Sir, I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

121
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,000
Fine.

122
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:19,671
Go, go!

123
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,769
-Hi.
-Hi.

124
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:35,395
Hi.

125
00:09:36,897 --> 00:09:40,109
I think there's something
that we really need to talk about.

126
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:44,363
I think we do. Why don't we go inside.

127
00:09:50,077 --> 00:09:54,789
-Look, I know why you're here.
-You do?

128
00:09:54,956 --> 00:09:58,168
Yeah, and to save you
from any embarrassment..

129
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:01,254
I think maybe I should talk first.

130
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:02,880
-Okay.
-Okay?

131
00:10:12,431 --> 00:10:14,809
Ross and Rachel.

132
00:10:14,976 --> 00:10:17,020
Rachel and Ross.

133
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:22,733
That's been one heck of a seesaw,
hasn't it?

134
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:25,277
What?

135
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:32,243
I mean, look, that one night we had
was fun and certainly passionate.

136
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,873
But don't you think it's better
if we just stay friends?

137
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,125
Seriously, what?

138
00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:44,921
Okay. You know what?

139
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,885
If you want to,
we can do it one more time.

140
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:56,182
I mean, I'd be okay with that.
In fact, I have some time right now..

141
00:10:56,349 --> 00:10:57,434
Okay.

142
00:10:57,642 --> 00:10:59,603
You know what? Can I talk now?

143
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:01,646
-Oh, sure.
-Okay.

144
00:11:08,112 --> 00:11:09,821
I'm pregnant.

145
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:15,743
Ross?

146
00:11:20,623 --> 00:11:22,042
Ross?

147
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:25,920
Okay, whenever you're ready.

148
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:35,888
And you're the father, by the way.
But you got..

149
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,522
-Can I get you some water?
-I'm good.

150
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:51,195
Ross, there is no pressure on you, okay? I
mean, you can be as involved as you want.

151
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:57,077
Yeah, I..

152
00:11:57,243 --> 00:12:00,704
I'm just, I don't know.
I don't understand..

153
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:04,833
how this happened.

154
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:10,798
-We used a condom.
-I know.

155
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:16,094
But you know, condoms only work,
like, 97 percent of the time.

156
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,138
What?

157
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:21,933
What?!

158
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:26,855
Well, they should put that on the box!

159
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,902
-They do.
-No, they don't!

160
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:42,287
Well, they should put it
in huge block letters!

161
00:12:42,454 --> 00:12:47,834
-Ross, let's just forget about the condoms.
-Well, I may as well have!

162
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:52,421
Listen, you know what?
I was really freaked out too..

163
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:55,383
-when I found out.
-Freaked..? Hey, I'm not freaked out.

164
00:12:56,593 --> 00:12:59,846
I'm indignant as a consumer!

165
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:05,559
-You know what? Let's talk later.
-No, I wanna talk now.

166
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:07,896
In fact, I wanna talk..

167
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:12,233
to the president
of the condom company.

168
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:14,860
Okay, you know what?
Maybe I should come back.. Okay.

169
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:18,406
Yeah, I'll press one!

170
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:27,998
-I looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
-So then I can heat this up?

171
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:30,960
Anyway, I'll get moving
on that new door.

172
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:36,089
Great. Listen, could you do us a favor and
not tell Chandler and Monica about this?

173
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:39,969
Because, you know, they don't have
any kids of their own..

174
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:43,431
and this door was like a child to them.

175
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,935
Well, I'm gonna have to put on a
new lock. They'll find out anyway.

176
00:13:49,436 --> 00:13:54,399
It's looking like an all-day job.
I'm gonna have to cancel my yoga class.

177
00:13:54,774 --> 00:13:58,111
Hey, Ross. Could you tell Jasmine
I can't make it to yoga class today?

178
00:13:58,278 --> 00:13:59,529
Sure.

179
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:08,913
-Oh, my God! What happened to the door?
-So it's noticeable, huh?

180
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:13,085
-Look, is Rachel here? I need to talk to her.
-Didn't you two already talk?

181
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:14,795
Yeah, but..

182
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:19,257
Okay. Look, you guys know
that Rachel and I slept together..

183
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:21,467
but there's something else.

184
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:24,888
Rachel's pregnant.

185
00:14:25,054 --> 00:14:27,891
-Holy mother of God!
-Oh, my God, I can't believe that!

186
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:35,647
-With my child.
-That is brand-new information!

187
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:43,114
-You already know, don't you?
-Little bit.

188
00:14:43,865 --> 00:14:47,660
-How you doing?
-Okay. I mean, I'll be okay.

189
00:14:47,868 --> 00:14:50,330
It's just, I don't think
I handled it very well.

190
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:52,832
-What'd you say to her?
-Nothing.

191
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,169
But the complaint department
at the condom company got an earful.

192
00:14:57,836 --> 00:15:00,673
-Then when I turned around, she was gone.
-Oh, Ross.

193
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:06,679
I know. But in my defense, I just found out
that condoms are only, like, 97% effective.

194
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:09,640
-What?
-I gotta go find her.

195
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:12,726
Hey. Hold on! Are you serious?

196
00:15:12,894 --> 00:15:16,021
So, like, 3 percent of the time,
they don't even work?

197
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:20,233
They should put that on the box!

198
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:24,112
-Evidently, they do.
-What?!

199
00:15:29,911 --> 00:15:31,745
Well, I'll be.

200
00:15:39,587 --> 00:15:43,090
-I can't believe we're here.
-You've gotta be kidding.

201
00:15:43,257 --> 00:15:44,841
What?

202
00:15:46,718 --> 00:15:50,680
As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would
like to give you the honeymoon suite.

203
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:54,017
No! You have been screwing us all day!

204
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,646
-Who are you?
-We're you. Just 10 seconds later!

205
00:16:00,273 --> 00:16:04,193
You already got the first-class tickets,
the lounge. We should get free stuff too!

206
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:06,946
You're not the only ones
on your honeymoon!

207
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:12,952
You can have the suite if you want.
We don't care about where we stay.

208
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:15,538
We're here to celebrate our love
for each other.

209
00:16:15,704 --> 00:16:19,542
We don't have to get free stuff.
We just want to be together.

210
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,713
We need the stuff.

211
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:31,429
Monica, it's Joey. Phoebe and I smell gas
coming from your apartment.

212
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:36,309
-What? Are you serious? Joey smells gas.
-What else is new?

213
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:41,730
-We'd check it out, but you took our keys.
-Well, do something. Get in there!

214
00:16:41,897 --> 00:16:46,360
-How? I guess I could break down your door.
-Yeah, do that.

215
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:49,781
-And you won't blame us for any damage?
-No.

216
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,453
-Are you doing it? I don't hear anything.
-Okay, I'll break it down.

217
00:17:00,332 --> 00:17:03,794
Hi. He's doing it,
he's breaking down the door.

218
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:09,716
Okay, we're in.

219
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:18,516
-Okay, Rachel, are you comfortable?
-If I said I was, would you judge me?

220
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,311
The doctor'll be here in a minute
to do your sonogram.

221
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:22,562
Okay.

222
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:30,570
Oh, man, I swear, if they sold these
at Pottery Barn..

223
00:17:32,906 --> 00:17:34,574
-Hi.
-Hi.

224
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:36,284
We need to talk.

225
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:41,330
Right now? Because I kind of got
an alfresco situation going on over here.

226
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:45,919
Please, I really.. I want to apologize
for the way I acted earlier today.

227
00:17:46,085 --> 00:17:49,922
-That's fine. Can you stay up near my head?
-What? Oh, yeah, sorry.

228
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:55,803
I went crazy. I was thinking about myself
when I should've been thinking about you..

229
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:58,222
-Okay, head, Ross! Head, Ross!
-Right.

230
00:17:58,389 --> 00:18:02,977
I want you to know that I'm gonna be there
through this whole thing. Okay?

231
00:18:03,144 --> 00:18:08,315
The doctor's appointments, the Lamaze
classes, baby-proofing the apartment.

232
00:18:08,481 --> 00:18:11,110
Although, we can worry about that
after we get married.

233
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:13,905
-Married?
-Well, yeah, I think we should get married.

234
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:17,074
Because that's your answer to everything?

235
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:22,036
No. Because that's the right thing to do.

236
00:18:22,245 --> 00:18:27,835
Yeah, maybe, if you're in love.
But Ross, we are not in love, are we?

237
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:33,632
No. But still, I mean,
you can't possibly do this alone.

238
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:35,383
Excuse me?

239
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:41,056
-You can't even eat alone in a restaurant.
-What?

240
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:45,143
If you can't eat by yourself, how do you
expect to have a baby by yourself?

241
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,896
-I can too eat by myself!
-When have you ever?

242
00:18:49,106 --> 00:18:53,735
When certain people leave the table
and I am not finished!

243
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:57,405
Well, certain other people take two hours
to eat a bowl of soup!

244
00:18:57,613 --> 00:18:59,866
Oh, please. You inhale your food.

245
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:04,078
I grew up with Monica.
If you didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!

246
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:08,749
Am I interrupting?

247
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:12,587
No, Dr. Long. Please come in.
This is Ross. He is the father.

248
00:19:12,796 --> 00:19:16,299
But not the husband, because,
evidently, she can do this alone.

249
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:20,637
Nice to meet you. I'll get started on this.

250
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:27,810
-Why you can't admit you need me?
-I need you to stay near my head!

251
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:34,817
Okay. Everything looks good.
Here it is on the screen.

252
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:37,862
Here's your uterus..

253
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:42,115
and right here is your baby.

254
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:45,618
Oh, my God.

255
00:19:49,748 --> 00:19:52,125
There it is. I see it.

256
00:19:52,335 --> 00:19:55,755
Congratulations.
I'll give you two a minute.

257
00:19:55,922 --> 00:19:58,173
-Okay.
-Thank you.

258
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:07,807
Pretty amazing, huh?

259
00:20:08,182 --> 00:20:10,477
I don't see it!

260
00:20:18,568 --> 00:20:22,573
-What?
-I can't see it.

261
00:20:23,031 --> 00:20:25,074
But you just said that you did.

262
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:28,828
I know. I lied. I didn't want her
to think I was a terrible mother.

263
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,788
I can't even see my own baby!

264
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:37,003
Oh, sure. Come here. Sure, you can.
Come here. Look, it's right there.

265
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,886
Oh, it's beautiful.

266
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,763
I see it now.

267
00:20:49,307 --> 00:20:52,351
-Do you really?
-No, I don't see it!

268
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,605
Okay. Come on. All right. Okay.

269
00:20:55,772 --> 00:21:01,235
You see this tiny thing
that looks like a peanut?

270
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:03,029
Yeah.

271
00:21:03,904 --> 00:21:05,698
Sweetie, that's it.

272
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,908
That's it?

273
00:21:08,492 --> 00:21:10,660
Well, I saw that.

274
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,128
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

275
00:21:22,506 --> 00:21:27,052
Wow, I can't believe that's our baby.

276
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:32,849
Yeah, that's our baby.

277
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:41,941
Well, they put up the new door.

278
00:21:42,193 --> 00:21:45,194
-So it's all locked up and secure?
-Yeah. Why?

279
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,824
I was trying to figure out how bad
I want one of Monica's turkey pot pies.

280
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,161
-Hi.
-Hey.

281
00:21:53,328 --> 00:21:56,581
-So how was the doctor?
-Everything went great.

282
00:21:56,748 --> 00:22:00,252
-Good.
-Hey, show them the picture of your uterus.

283
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,092
I don't see the baby. Where is it?

284
00:22:08,258 --> 00:22:12,095
Oh, no, I know. I couldn't see it either
at first. But it's right..

285
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,850
Ross, I lost it again.
