1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,612
All right,
let's play one more time, okay?

2
00:00:03,782 --> 00:00:06,842
And remember, if I win,
you do not move to Paris.

3
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:10,113
Okay. I can't believe
I'm risking this again, but you're on.

4
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:13,918
All right, Joe, you remember the rules.
Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.

5
00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:15,491
Just flip.

6
00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:19,323
- Tails!
- Damn it!

7
00:00:20,365 --> 00:00:23,596
So we thought we'd throw you
a little going-away party around 7.

8
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:25,327
Oh, that sounds good.

9
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:28,496
Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow.
Shouldn't you be packing?

10
00:00:28,674 --> 00:00:31,268
- It's all done.
- Oh, yeah, right.

11
00:00:31,443 --> 00:00:35,937
And after I took a shower this morning,
I just threw my towel on the floor.

12
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:38,943
- Oh, God, it hurts to even joke about it.
- I know.

13
00:00:39,318 --> 00:00:43,152
Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage
that I'm taking is in the bedroom.

14
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:46,917
This is Emma's Paris stuff. These are
the boxes that I'm having shipped...

15
00:00:47,092 --> 00:00:49,322
...and that's the sandwich
I made for the plane.

16
00:00:49,494 --> 00:00:51,621
Which could've used
a little more mustard.

17
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:55,697
- Okay, so you've done some good work.
- Yeah.

18
00:00:55,867 --> 00:00:57,164
What about your carryons?

19
00:00:57,336 --> 00:01:00,601
Oh, well, everything that I need
is in here...

20
00:01:00,772 --> 00:01:03,240
...and my travel documents
are on the counter...

21
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:06,468
...organized in the order that
I will be needing them.

22
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:10,206
Oh, my God.
I have nothing left to teach you.

23
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,651
- Where's your passport?
- It should be next to my plane ticket.

24
00:01:15,821 --> 00:01:19,120
- Well, it's not.
- What? Well, maybe I put it in here?

25
00:01:20,492 --> 00:01:21,857
Oh, it's not in there!

26
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:24,655
Oh, no, I must have packed it
in one of these boxes!

27
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,797
- Here, let me help you.
- Shoot.

28
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:31,225
I can't believe I did this.

29
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:35,167
At what point did it stop being funny
that I took her passport?

30
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:28,017
Oh, wow, can you believe
you're only three weeks away?

31
00:02:28,193 --> 00:02:29,524
I know.

32
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:33,426
- You don't mind me touching your belly?
- I don't mind you touching my belly...

33
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,557
...but your hand's kind of blocking the
part where the baby's gonna come out.

34
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:41,436
- Hey!
- Hey.

35
00:02:41,606 --> 00:02:46,202
Hi, Erica. Welcome back to town.
Wow, look how big you've gotten.

36
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:48,505
That's because I'm pregnant.

37
00:02:49,214 --> 00:02:52,149
- Right. No, I understand.
- Oh, okay.

38
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:55,912
I'm just always afraid that people think
I'm just fat with big breasts.

39
00:02:56,888 --> 00:02:58,719
No, no, I knew.

40
00:03:02,527 --> 00:03:05,928
- Okay, well, stop staring at them.
- She brought them up.

41
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,960
I didn't realize
you were coming back so soon.

42
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:12,262
In a couple weeks
I won't be able to travel.

43
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:15,998
And I wanted her to get to know the
doctors and get settled into the hotel.

44
00:03:16,174 --> 00:03:20,304
- Why isn't she staying with you guys?
- Because we're moving in a couple days.

45
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,643
Plus, hotels are fun! My room has
this little fridge full of free snacks.

46
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:27,646
Erica, those things aren't free.

47
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:30,947
They have one of the highest markups
of any consumer product--

48
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:35,025
Ross, she's giving us her baby.
She can eat you if she wants.

49
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:38,754
I'll be right back.

50
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:44,133
Oh, man, I can't believe you guys
are leaving this place.

51
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:46,827
I know. I know.

52
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:50,600
You know, you could take it if you want.
The lease is still in Nana's name.

53
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:54,507
No, no. This will always be your place.
It would be too sad.

54
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:57,079
Plus, how much a month
does it cost to feed Joey?

55
00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:59,376
Yeah, it takes two incomes.

56
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:02,018
Is Chandler here?
We talked about catching a movie.

57
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:04,212
Oh, no, he doesn't have time for that.

58
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:06,880
You can go help him and Joey
pack up the guest room.

59
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:10,027
Packing. Sexy cheerleader comedy.

60
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:14,893
Helpful brother.
Creepy loner at teen movie.

61
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:18,366
"Creepy...."

62
00:04:26,278 --> 00:04:30,374
- What are you guys doing?
- Try it. I can't feel a thing.

63
00:04:37,656 --> 00:04:39,556
Are you kidding?

64
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:43,423
- This is packing?
- We're taking a break.

65
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:44,926
From?

66
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,189
Jumping on the bed.

67
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:51,361
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple
of hours, and there's a lot to do.

68
00:04:51,536 --> 00:04:54,699
Ross, you've got Geller blood.
You're in charge of these yahoos.

69
00:04:54,873 --> 00:04:56,340
- You got it.
- All right.

70
00:04:56,508 --> 00:04:58,703
All right, she's right.
We gotta get serious.

71
00:04:58,877 --> 00:05:01,869
Let's put Styrofoam peanuts
down his pants and kick him!

72
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:07,683
No, guys, she's right. We should get
to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet.

73
00:05:07,853 --> 00:05:11,311
Joey, you pack them, and Ross,
you repack whatever Joey packs.

74
00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:17,327
You guys hear a ringing?

75
00:05:19,264 --> 00:05:24,793
- What the hell is this?
- Hey, handcuffs. And fur-lined. Nice.

76
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,370
I didn't know you guys had it in you.

77
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,141
Chandler, you don't have a sister,
so you can't understand...

78
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:34,039
...how much this bums me out.

79
00:05:34,546 --> 00:05:37,242
I didn't know Monica had these.

80
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:41,545
Maybe she used them
with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard.

81
00:05:43,788 --> 00:05:47,519
Why would she use them with Richard
and not me? I can be kinky.

82
00:05:48,126 --> 00:05:52,756
I once did a naked dance for her
with scarves.

83
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,426
Bumming hard, guys.
Bumming hard.

84
00:06:04,943 --> 00:06:06,410
- Hey.
- Hey. Where's Mike?

85
00:06:06,578 --> 00:06:08,045
Oh, he has a gig.

86
00:06:08,213 --> 00:06:11,080
It's kind of like being married
to a rock star, you know?

87
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:13,308
My husband has a gig.

88
00:06:14,452 --> 00:06:15,783
Yeah? Where is it?

89
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:20,152
Oh, he's playing organ
for a children's roller-skating party.

90
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,521
Rock on!

91
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:27,394
Wow, this is quite a spread.
What is all this stuff?

92
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:30,932
I thought this would be a great
opportunity to use up all the food...

93
00:06:31,102 --> 00:06:34,037
...that I don't want to move
to the new house with me.

94
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:39,267
So enjoy. Smoked oyster casserole
with a breakfast-cereal crust.

95
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:46,242
Kidney beans in their own juices,
and for dessert, a questionable orange.

96
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:50,811
Well, I think I speak
for everyone when I say:

97
00:06:53,992 --> 00:06:55,323
- Hey.
- Hey.

98
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:57,484
- Where's Rach?
- She's putting Emma down.

99
00:06:57,662 --> 00:07:00,927
She'll be over in a second.
It just hit her that she's leaving.

100
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:05,001
She's kind of emotional, so no one
say anything to set her off, okay?

101
00:07:06,304 --> 00:07:07,635
- Hey, Rach.
- Hey.

102
00:07:07,806 --> 00:07:09,774
There she is.

103
00:07:10,175 --> 00:07:12,473
Hi, you guys.

104
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:14,401
What did I just say?

105
00:07:16,448 --> 00:07:19,178
Oh, no, no, no, it's okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna be fine.

106
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,945
- Come here, I'll make you a drink.
- Okay.

107
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:25,651
Oh, man, I can't believe
she's actually leaving.

108
00:07:25,824 --> 00:07:27,655
How am I gonna say goodbye
to Rachel?

109
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:30,426
I know, she's been
such a big part of my life.

110
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:33,291
It feels like when <i>Melrose Place</i>
got cancelled.

111
00:07:37,702 --> 00:07:39,363
I mean....

112
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:42,768
Forget it, I miss <i>Melrose Place</i>.

113
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:46,844
- I had a chance to stop her too.
- Yeah?

114
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:50,675
Who loses 57 coin tosses
in a row? You know?

115
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:53,784
Heads, she wins. Tails, I lose.

116
00:07:58,723 --> 00:08:00,418
Wait a minute.

117
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:04,790
- Yes, Joe?
- I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning.

118
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:10,529
So you doing okay?

119
00:08:10,702 --> 00:08:14,194
Well, I've been better.
You guys are gonna come visit, right?

120
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:17,739
Yes! You know, in six months,
the statute of limitations runs out...

121
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:20,707
...and I can travel internationally again.

122
00:08:22,614 --> 00:08:26,015
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I know.

123
00:08:26,818 --> 00:08:29,878
You know what? I have some
goodbye stuff that I wanted to say...

124
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:35,186
...to each of you. I was gonna save it
till the end of the night, but come here.

125
00:08:37,595 --> 00:08:40,120
Hey, what do you think
they're doing in there?

126
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:42,060
If I had to guess, I'd say...

127
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:45,862
...Rachel's putting on the bubble wrap,
and Phoebe's doing the punching.

128
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,602
Pheebs, I don't even know
where to start.

129
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:55,872
Okay, well, before you do, I know we
weren't supposed to get you presents...

130
00:08:56,047 --> 00:08:58,379
...but I do have something for you.

131
00:09:01,286 --> 00:09:03,550
- What is it?
- Well, it's a cotton swab...

132
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:05,484
...with a bit of my saliva on it...

133
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:10,921
...so that if they perfect the cloning
process while you're over there...

134
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:14,327
...you can use the DNA
to create your own Pheebs.

135
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,301
I'm gonna throw this away...

136
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:25,809
...but thank you so much for the gesture.

137
00:09:27,112 --> 00:09:28,773
Chandler?

138
00:09:29,147 --> 00:09:33,140
I was just in our bedroom,
and I found these on my pillow.

139
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:36,810
Oh, yes, I decided to leave those
out for you in case Richard stops by...

140
00:09:36,988 --> 00:09:41,220
...and you want to engage in a little
light bondage and mustache play.

141
00:09:42,827 --> 00:09:44,454
What? These aren't mine.

142
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:45,960
Oh, yeah, right!

143
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:49,066
Good luck getting another scarf dance
from me.

144
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:52,602
That would be a terrible punishment.

145
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:56,536
But I'm serious,
I've never seen these before.

146
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,734
Really? Then what are they doing
in our guest room?

147
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:01,874
Rachel used to live in that room.

148
00:10:02,046 --> 00:10:05,641
Rachel. With handcuffs.

149
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:07,580
Interesting.

150
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:09,713
Joey's bare ass.

151
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:15,690
Well played.

152
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:24,291
- I love you, Phoebe.
- I love you too.

153
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:28,202
Please....

154
00:10:28,373 --> 00:10:29,704
Please don't--

155
00:10:29,874 --> 00:10:33,435
Don't turn into, you know,
a French bitch.

156
00:10:34,145 --> 00:10:35,806
I won't.

157
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:40,518
All right. Well, if I'm gonna do this,
I better keep going.

158
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:42,016
- Okay.
- Okay.

159
00:10:42,187 --> 00:10:43,518
- Monica?
- Yeah?

160
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:46,657
- Will you come with me for a minute?
- Sure.

161
00:10:48,193 --> 00:10:50,627
- Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
- No.

162
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:52,854
Oh, you're so screwed.

163
00:10:58,269 --> 00:10:59,668
Hey.

164
00:10:59,837 --> 00:11:01,134
What was that all about?

165
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:04,803
She's gonna say goodbye
to each of us individually.

166
00:11:05,543 --> 00:11:07,602
Are you kidding? Oh, my God.

167
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:11,340
Yeah, I know. It's gonna be
even worse for you. God.

168
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:14,110
Well, just get ready
to do some serious crying.

169
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:17,711
Man, I'm not gonna be able
to handle this.

170
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,851
Now I know how my students feel
at the end of each year.

171
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:28,528
And why they act out
by giving me such bad evaluations.

172
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,565
Mon. Okay.

173
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:38,903
I better just say what it is
I'm gonna say.

174
00:11:41,913 --> 00:11:46,873
None of the amazing things that have
happened to me in the last 10 years...

175
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:49,315
...would have happened
if it wasn't for you.

176
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:56,050
No one has been more like a sister to me.

177
00:11:56,427 --> 00:11:58,292
I know what you mean.

178
00:11:58,463 --> 00:12:00,192
You're like a sister to me too.

179
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:09,500
I don't know what I'm going to do
without you.

180
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:13,909
You're the greatest friend I ever had.

181
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:17,870
--Seeing you every day.

182
00:12:19,284 --> 00:12:20,945
What?

183
00:12:21,753 --> 00:12:24,278
I-- l-- l--

184
00:12:24,455 --> 00:12:28,016
--see you every day!

185
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:30,623
That is so sweet!

186
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:39,329
Oh, no, she took down Monica.

187
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:43,371
And I'm the crier in the family.

188
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:46,906
Oh, God, I could be next.

189
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,714
Maybe she won't talk to me if it
looks like we're deep in conversation.

190
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:53,146
Oh, so that thing you said
about the thing...

191
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:55,809
...it really made me think
about that other thing.

192
00:12:55,987 --> 00:12:58,717
- Rach?
- Oh, it's okay, Chandler's talking to her.

193
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,256
I really made you think
about that thing, huh?

194
00:13:05,963 --> 00:13:09,865
Rach, I think I have something
that belongs to you.

195
00:13:13,738 --> 00:13:19,267
I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh
at your weird jokes that I don't get.

196
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:24,172
No, no, they're really yours.
We found them in your old room.

197
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:27,079
These aren't mine.
Maybe Monica used to use them with--

198
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:28,843
Don't say Richard.

199
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:34,148
Well, if they're not Monica's and
they're not yours, then whose are they?

200
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:37,590
I think you're forgetting the kinkiest
former resident of that room.

201
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,495
- Pheebs!
- Yeah!

202
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:44,260
I think these are yours.

203
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,773
These are not mine.
Look how flimsy they are. Come on.

204
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:54,842
My God, you try to hang a guy
from a water pipe with these...

205
00:13:55,012 --> 00:13:58,072
...they'll snap like a piece of licorice.

206
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,950
- Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
- Sure.

207
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:08,854
You don't really handcuff guys
to water pipes do you?

208
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:11,756
Where do you think Mike really is?

209
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:22,137
Oh, honey....

210
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:25,275
Let me just saying something
because once we get into this...

211
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:29,379
...I'm gonna get all uncomfortable
and probably make some stupid joke.

212
00:14:31,482 --> 00:14:34,315
I just want to say that l--
I love you.

213
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,780
And I'm gonna miss you.

214
00:14:39,557 --> 00:14:42,151
And I'm so sad that you're leaving.

215
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:46,923
Oh, you know what?

216
00:14:48,065 --> 00:14:50,431
Let's not say anything else.

217
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:52,296
I love you.

218
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:55,737
Not so tight.

219
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,271
- I'm sorry, give me one more chance.
- Okay.

220
00:15:01,446 --> 00:15:03,107
Okay.

221
00:15:05,016 --> 00:15:09,646
I'm sorry. Just go. Just go.
I can't. I can't.

222
00:15:15,092 --> 00:15:17,993
- So I guess you're next. You ready?
- I don't think so.

223
00:15:18,162 --> 00:15:21,825
Oh, you're definitely not.
I haven't cried like that in years.

224
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:24,297
You cried yesterday
at the 6:00 news.

225
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:27,836
That old woman was being scammed
by her mechanic.

226
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:32,470
God, I can't believe
she saved me for last.

227
00:15:32,643 --> 00:15:34,372
Why are they taking so long?

228
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:39,141
I don't know. But, God, Joey seems
to be handling it surprisingly well.

229
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:44,817
- No!
- No! Joey!

230
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:55,031
Okay, here we go.

231
00:15:58,135 --> 00:16:00,865
- Well....
- Yeah.

232
00:16:01,772 --> 00:16:04,036
I think I'm gonna take off.

233
00:16:09,013 --> 00:16:12,380
I have such a big, big day tomorrow, so--

234
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,710
- Rach.
- Yeah?

235
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:16,786
Aren't you forgetting something?

236
00:16:18,122 --> 00:16:22,388
- Oh, right. Ross.
- Yes?

237
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,929
I forgot to write your mom a birthday card.
Would you please do that for me?

238
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,634
- Sure.
- Thank you.

239
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:34,760
Oh, you guys, this was an amazing
night. Thank you so much.

240
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:36,736
I love you.

241
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:38,569
Good night.

242
00:16:42,613 --> 00:16:44,274
What?!

243
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:49,785
I don't get a goodbye?

244
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:51,854
Lucky bastard.

245
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:01,662
Unbelievable.
She says goodbye to everyone but me!

246
00:17:01,832 --> 00:17:05,199
Well, maybe she thought that
with all of your history, it could be...

247
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:09,635
- ...you know, implicit.
- Well, it needs to be "plicit."

248
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:14,237
You know, maybe she was just
really spent from our talk.

249
00:17:14,412 --> 00:17:16,312
- It was pretty intense.
- Yeah, mine too.

250
00:17:16,514 --> 00:17:19,142
- Mine was a humdinger.
- Okay!

251
00:17:19,317 --> 00:17:22,844
All right, let's think about this.
I mean, there's gotta be an explanation.

252
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,013
- Did you do anything to make her mad?
- No, I don't think so.

253
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:32,857
You didn't, say, borrow her
<i>Girls Gone Wild</i> video and never return it?

254
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,827
Really? Now?

255
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:41,371
I mean, don't I deserve anything?
I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?

256
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:45,840
Not from you!

257
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:49,879
Ross, if you're this upset,
you should go and talk to her.

258
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:52,481
And say what?
You owe me a goodbye?

259
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,086
- I mean, he's got more pride than that.
- The hell I do!

260
00:18:00,024 --> 00:18:02,390
- I don't get a goodbye?
- What?

261
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,860
Everyone gets a goodbye but me?
What do I gotta do to get a goodbye?

262
00:18:07,031 --> 00:18:10,125
Be best friends with you?
Go out with you?

263
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:11,700
Have a baby with you?

264
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:15,202
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute!
I did all those things!

265
00:18:15,673 --> 00:18:17,800
- Ross--
- Or maybe I'm just not giving you...

266
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:22,639
...enough credit. I mean, it is difficult
to say goodbye to five people.

267
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:25,680
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,
goodbye, g--

268
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,715
It's physically impossible!

269
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:33,255
You know what?
After all we've been through...

270
00:18:33,424 --> 00:18:36,689
...l can't believe this is how
you want to leave things between us.

271
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:39,159
Have a good time in Paris.

272
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:47,101
Rach, I know this
may not be the best time...

273
00:18:47,271 --> 00:18:52,402
...but Joey's going over the balcony again.
Could you just come talk to him?

274
00:18:57,581 --> 00:19:00,880
- I hope Ross isn't too upset.
- I'm sure he's not more bummed out...

275
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:03,077
- ...than I am.
- Tell me about it.

276
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:06,155
Well, you can't say
we don't know how to throw a party.

277
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:09,115
I think I'm gonna head out.

278
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:13,858
- Where do you think you're going?
- I thought I was going home to bed...

279
00:19:14,031 --> 00:19:17,091
...but I'm sensing there's something
less fun for me to do here.

280
00:19:18,202 --> 00:19:21,000
We're moving, and we got
a lot of packing to do.

281
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:25,268
- It'd be great if you guys could pitch in.
- Joey and I can finish up the guest room.

282
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:27,240
Yeah, good idea.

283
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:30,912
Oh, no. You and Phoebe
are gonna help me in here.

284
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:33,976
You couldn't be cool.

285
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:37,211
We're gonna start in the kitchen.

286
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:40,516
Plates get put into plate protectors
and stacked 10 to a box.

287
00:19:40,691 --> 00:19:44,593
The silverware gets bundled in rubber
bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?

288
00:19:44,762 --> 00:19:46,730
- Yeah.
- Good. I need you to be careful...

289
00:19:46,897 --> 00:19:49,559
...and efficient. And remember,
if I'm harsh with you...

290
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:52,532
...it is only because
you're doing it wrong.

291
00:19:54,672 --> 00:19:57,664
Hey, Mon, I think I figured out
whose handcuffs they are.

292
00:19:57,842 --> 00:20:00,538
- You did? How?
- Well, I was cleaning out the closet...

293
00:20:00,711 --> 00:20:03,077
...and I found some pictures of them...

294
00:20:03,247 --> 00:20:07,183
- ...being used.
- Oh, my God, let me see.

295
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:10,319
Who's that dirty old lady?

296
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:13,322
Monica's grandmother.

297
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:18,420
Oh, my God.
Nana liked it rough!

298
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,895
- Hi.
- Hey.

299
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,264
- What are you guys looking at?
- Oh, just normal pictures...

300
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:27,996
...of our regular family not having sex.

301
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,505
- Oh, here, have a seat.
- Yeah.

302
00:20:30,674 --> 00:20:32,642
- How was your night?
- Oh, it was okay.

303
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,540
I went to a movie with my cousin
then out for dinner.

304
00:20:35,713 --> 00:20:38,079
We went to this place that had--

305
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,015
Anyway, they had these
really amazing cheeseburgers.

306
00:20:49,794 --> 00:20:53,161
- Erica, are you okay?
- Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.

307
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:57,994
I keep getting these stomachaches.
They come and go every few minutes.

308
00:20:59,737 --> 00:21:04,140
- Oh, my God.
- Relax, we'll just get her some antacids.

309
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,233
She doesn't have a stomachache!
She's in labor!

310
00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:09,879
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, you gotta get to the hospital!

311
00:21:10,047 --> 00:21:14,006
Chandler, get the coats! Erica, let's go!
Phoebe and Joey, keep packing!

312
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:16,710
Oh, my God, we're gonna have a baby.

313
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:19,253
We're gonna have a baby!

314
00:21:19,423 --> 00:21:21,516
Oh, my God,
we're gonna have a baby!

315
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:24,889
Oh, God, I've gotta sit down!
I've gotta sit down!

316
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,157
- Honey, it's gonna be okay.
- You can do this. Just breathe.

317
00:21:30,568 --> 00:21:33,366
Okay. Okay.

318
00:21:33,537 --> 00:21:34,970
Okay, I feel a little better.

319
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,069
Are you sure?

320
00:21:39,376 --> 00:21:41,936
- Yes, I'm sure. Oh, honey, let's go.
- Okay.

321
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:44,171
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay, bye, everyone!

322
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:45,872
- We're having a baby!
- Good luck!

323
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,813
- Chandler, wait, wait, wait!
- What?

324
00:21:47,985 --> 00:21:51,512
If you get a second, find out
where she got that cheeseburger.

325
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:00,558
"Dear, Judy.

326
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:03,131
Happy birthday, love Rach--"

327
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,133
No. You know what? I'm not doing this.

328
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:11,531
You think I didn't say goodbye
to you because I don't care?

329
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:13,233
That's what it seemed like.

330
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:18,109
I cannot believe that after 10 years
you do not know one thing about me!

331
00:22:18,282 --> 00:22:23,584
- Then why didn't you say something?
- Because it is too damn hard, Ross!

332
00:22:23,754 --> 00:22:28,384
I can't even begin to explain to you
how much I am gonna miss you.

333
00:22:28,993 --> 00:22:33,225
When I think about not seeing you
every day, it makes me not want to go.

334
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:37,359
Okay? So if you think that
I didn't say goodbye to you...

335
00:22:37,534 --> 00:22:41,129
...because you don't mean as much
to me as everybody else, you're wrong.

336
00:22:41,305 --> 00:22:44,069
It's because you mean more to me.

337
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:46,675
So there, all right?
There's your goodbye!

338
00:22:47,111 --> 00:22:48,544
- Rach!
- What?

339
00:22:48,712 --> 00:22:50,942
- You keep-- You can't--
- What?

340
00:23:11,902 --> 00:23:14,132
- A little more.
- Okay.

341
00:23:14,972 --> 00:23:17,440
- A little more. A little more.
- All right.

342
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:21,039
Little more.

343
00:23:23,213 --> 00:23:25,875
- All right. All right, let's do this.
- All right, ready?

344
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,780
Yep. Now give me your best shot.

345
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,718
All right. Here goes.

346
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:39,157
Doesn't work.
