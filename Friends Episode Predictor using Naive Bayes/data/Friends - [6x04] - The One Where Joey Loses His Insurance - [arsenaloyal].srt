1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:05,303
Monica, which of all of this
kitchen stuff is mine?

2
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:07,530
This bottle opener.

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:10,732
-And...?
-And it's a magnet.

4
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,581
Look at that!

5
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,885
How weird is that?
You're moving in with me...

6
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:24,215
and you have the one thing
I don't have.

7
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:28,360
It's like, in a way,
you complete me.

8
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:33,264
-Kitchen.
-What?

9
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,093
You complete me kitchen, matey!

10
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,232
I know what you're thinking.

11
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:45,075
That she'll move in with you, then
fall in love with you, and then...

12
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:49,041
when she finds out you're already
married, she'll be happy.

13
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:52,183
You know? You're just very sad.

14
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,947
Oh, my God!

15
00:00:56,856 --> 00:01:01,759
I see what this is.
You are in love with Rachel!

16
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:06,994
It all adds up! You're obsessed
with her. It's always:

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,193
"What will you do about Rachel?
Why are you moving in with Rachel?

18
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,239
When will you confess your secret
marriage to Rachel?" You want her!

19
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,409
Saved by the bell.

20
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,249
Aren't these candlesticks mine?

21
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,784
No, I bought those.

22
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,449
Oh, right. I forgot.

23
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,616
That you're a liar!

24
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:40,063
That's great! I'll be there Monday.
And thank you again.

25
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:45,168
That was the head
of the paleontology department...

26
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,598
at N...

27
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:47,898
Y...

28
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,234
U.

29
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,106
Wow. What...

30
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,333
did he...

31
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,272
say?

32
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:59,444
Remember that paper I had published
last year on sediment flow rate?

33
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,154
-They loved it.
-Well, who wouldn't?

34
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,148
I know!

35
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,025
Anyway, they asked me
to be a guest lecturer.

36
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:13,823
It's temporary, but if they like me,
it could lead to a full-time job.

37
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,501
How great would that look
on the mailbox? Professor Geller.

38
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,498
Professor and Mrs.

39
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,970
And Mrs.?

40
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,804
You and Ross are still married.

41
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:29,674
What?

42
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,442
Just kidding!

43
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,043
Oh, God!

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,952
Saved your ass.

45
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,298
The One Where Joey Loses His lnsurance

46
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,464
What's the matter?

47
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,769
You know that psychic I see?

48
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:33,408
She told me I'm gonna die this week,
so I'm bummed.

49
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:40,811
I know you don't know about readings,
but that's the worst you can get.

50
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,582
That's crazy.

51
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,314
She'd say that to you?

52
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,287
You don't believe her, do you?

53
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,394
I don't know. She said
that I'd have triplets...

54
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,394
but she also said one of them
would be black.

55
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,593
Just out of curiosity,
did she say how you'd go?

56
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,500
She didn't tell me I'd die
till the end of the session.

57
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,173
I wasn't gonna waste
a whole other hour there!

58
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,274
I've only got a week left.

59
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,911
I've really gotta start living now!

60
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,174
Hey, everyone.

61
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,985
Well, today's my first lecture...

62
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,192
and I wanted to try it out
on you guys. Do you mind?

63
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,324
No, that'd be great!

64
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:39,175
"There are three primary theories
concerning sediment flow rate.

65
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,006
Each of these theories can be further
subcategorized into two..."

66
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,150
This is it.
This is what's gonna kill me.

67
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:54,016
"...subcategories. The first
of these subcategories is.."

68
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,390
Are there naked chicks
on that piece of paper?

69
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,122
No. Why?

70
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:05,394
I never seen a guy stare so hard at
something that didn't have chicks on it.

71
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,346
"There are three primary theories...

72
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,585
concerning sediment flow rate.

73
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,053
Each of these theories...

74
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,226
can be further subcategorized...

75
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,383
into.."

76
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,654
Why don't you open with a joke?

77
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:36,593
Open with a joke?
It's a university, not a comedy club.

78
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,734
Wait a minute, hold the phone.

79
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,867
You're not talking
about Chuckles University?

80
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,909
Come on, we're kidding.

81
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,203
You know what might make it
less boring?

82
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:49,506
Thank you.

83
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,543
Some visual aids.

84
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,449
-You know what's a good visual aid?
-Don't say naked chicks.

85
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,888
Why not?

86
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,522
I don't even know why I talk
to you guys about it.

87
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:06,094
I'm just gonna do it on my own,
with no naked chicks.

88
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,994
That's the way I did it
till I was 19.

89
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,495
All right, 20.

90
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,205
Twenty-three.

91
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,710
Any good mail?

92
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,817
Something from
the Screen Actors Guild.

93
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:31,149
It's probably a residual check.
Can you open it? I got....

94
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,590
"Benefits lapsed."

95
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:35,987
That's weird.

96
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:39,323
I don't remember being in a movie
called Benefits Lapsed.

97
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:44,494
It's not a check. Your health
insurance expired because...

98
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:48,262
-you didn't work enough last year.
-Let me see that.

99
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,434
Oh, I can't believe this!

100
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,975
This sucks!

101
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,849
When I had insurance,
I could get hit by a bus...

102
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,846
or catch on fire, you know?

103
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,882
And it wouldn't matter.
Now I gotta be careful?

104
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,814
I'm sorry. There's never
a good time to have to...

105
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,286
stop catching on fire.

106
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,227
All right, well...

107
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,829
I guess I gotta go see my agent.

108
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:17,035
Make sure to look both ways
before you cross the street.

109
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,964
"Make sure to look both ways
before you cross the street."

110
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,346
Hey, you're still alive!

111
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,515
How are you feeling?

112
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,984
It's so exhausting, waiting for death.

113
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,191
Oh, by the way, do you think you..

114
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,092
What are you doing?

115
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,165
Preparing you for..
Didn't you think I was dead?

116
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,096
Did that not come off?

117
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,700
Yeah, scared the hell out of me.
I thought we'd lost you forever.

118
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,842
-You wanna lie down?
-Yeah, thanks.

119
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,911
Can you do me a favor?

120
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,272
Wake me up in a couple hours.

121
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,380
You know, if you can.

122
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,415
Did you take these back?

123
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,454
I liked them so much
that I bought some for myself.

124
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,894
They're really great, aren't they?

125
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,192
I love them.

126
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:25,763
Nice try.

127
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,702
How'd the lecture go?

128
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,934
It went great.

129
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:37,081
And I didn't need any jokes
or naked chicks either.

130
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:40,375
That's great. I'm sorry
we weren't supportive before.

131
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,612
I knew I just had to let
the material speak for itself.

132
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,950
Everyone's all, "Ross, you have
to be funny and sexy."

133
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,387
Well, I proved them wrong!

134
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,397
And now I'm gonna pass
the news on to Joey and Chandler.

135
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,328
-That you're not funny or sexy?
-That's right!

136
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,808
-Hey, Estelle, listen..
-Well, well, well.

137
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,635
Joey Tribbiani.

138
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,939
So you came back, huh?

139
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,683
They think they can do better,
but they all...

140
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,750
come crawling back to Estelle.

141
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,247
What are you talking about?

142
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,160
I never left you.
You've always been my agent.

143
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,020
Really?

144
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,992
Oh, well, no harm no foul.

145
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:32,833
Look, you gotta get me some work.
I lost my health insurance.

146
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,370
All right, first thing we gotta do:
damage control.

147
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,975
-Why?
-Well, I think...

148
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,372
someone out there...

149
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:45,014
may have been bad-mouthing you
all over town.

150
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,281
The bastard!

151
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,060
We're early.
The lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.

152
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,593
-But we could sneak in and watch.
-Yeah, we could.

153
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:01,722
Hey, look. There's some
Kappa Kappa Deltas. I was a Kappa.

154
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,892
Hey, sisters.

155
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,734
Wow, we really are bitches.

156
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:15,780
Right. So when Rigby got his samples
back from the laboratory...

157
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,382
he made a startling discovery.

158
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:25,686
What he believed to be igneous
was, in fact, sedimentary.

159
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:29,551
Imagine his consternation when..

160
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,596
Oh, bloody hell.

161
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,410
So Estelle lined up a bunch
of auditions for me tomorrow.

162
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,584
And I'll have my health insurance
back in no time.

163
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,316
That's great, but shouldn't you
be on the toilet right now?

164
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,425
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

165
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:09,260
I got this blinding pain in my stomach
when I was lifting weights before.

166
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,528
And then I passed out...

167
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,830
and I haven't been able
to stand up since.

168
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,938
But I don't think
it's anything serious.

169
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,011
This sounds like a hernia.
Go to the doctor.

170
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:26,979
No way. If I go to the doctor, it'll be for
this thing sticking out of my stomach!

171
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,385
That's a hernia.

172
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:35,320
Why'd I have to start
working out again?

173
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,891
Damn you, 15s!

174
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,666
What the hell are you doing?

175
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,829
Look, I was nervous.

176
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,904
You guys had me all worried
I was gonna be boring.

177
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:51,508
I got up there and they were
all, like, staring at me.

178
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:55,510
I opened my mouth and this
British accent just came out.

179
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,339
Yeah, and not a very good one.

180
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,416
Will you, please...?

181
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,517
Dr. Geller? Kurt Rathman.

182
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:05,279
I'm a paleontology professor here.

183
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,416
Do you have a moment
to talk about your lecture?

184
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,458
I'm sorry, I've got plans
with my sister.

185
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,699
Monica Geller.

186
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,600
Right. Will you excuse us
for one moment?

187
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,768
-What are you doing?
-You can have an accent, but I can't?

188
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,933
Top of the morning to you, laddies!

189
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,868
Would you just please stop?

190
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:33,146
Yes, yes, Bombay is very, very nice
this time of year.

191
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,802
Hey, will you grab me a cruller?

192
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,765
Sit down!

193
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,001
Will you go to the hospital?

194
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,972
Hernia operations cost...

195
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,941
a lot probably, okay?

196
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:06,744
Besides, it's getting darker and more
painful. That means it's healing.

197
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,451
Look, I'll loan you the money.

198
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:13,021
Just go to the hospital and
let's just get that thing...

199
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,815
pushed back in.

200
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,656
Thank you, but it'd take me
forever to pay you back.

201
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,922
I don't want that
hanging over my head.

202
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,328
Besides, when my
insurance kicks in...

203
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,469
I can get all the free
operations I want.

204
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,764
I'll probably start
with that laser eye surgery.

205
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:34,868
What's going on?

206
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:39,982
Joey's got a hernia, but it's nothing
a little laser eye surgery won't fix.

207
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,683
I'm telling you,
if I put my hand on my stomach...

208
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,117
it doesn't hurt that bad.

209
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,322
Hey, maybe you'll die!

210
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,728
Chandler, I'm scared.

211
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,724
No, we can go together.

212
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,903
Just don't wait too long, because I'm
out of here sometime before Friday.

213
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,563
But I don't want to die.

214
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:05,037
It'll be fun. We'll come back
and haunt these guys!

215
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,672
Wait. Could I come back and haunt Monica
and Rachel when they're in the shower?

216
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,385
-That's my girlfriend.
-Hey, I'm dead!

217
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,788
-Give me them!
-No, they are mine!

218
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,087
-You stole them from me!
-You stole them from me!

219
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,389
Give me them!

220
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,066
Just wanna each take one?

221
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,295
Yeah, that seems fair.
We never use them.

222
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,101
Look, I really need
some help, okay?

223
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,745
Why did I have to speak
in a British accent?

224
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,404
What do I do?

225
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,916
Why don't you call
Mummy and Daddy?

226
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:52,114
I'm serious! Someone's gonna find out and
then they're never gonna offer me a job.

227
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,418
Why don't you phase it out?
Yeah, phase the accent out.

228
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,926
People will think you're
adjusting to life in America.

229
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,355
Come on.
No one will even notice.

230
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,091
They're probably not even
listening to you.

231
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,627
They're not listening to me?

232
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,466
Of course they're listening to you.

233
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,441
Everybody listens to you.

234
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:15,241
Monica, do you think I should
try this phasing-out thing?

235
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,037
I think you look fine.

236
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,644
Whenever you're ready.

237
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:25,920
Hey, Timmy.

238
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,560
I've got a surprise...

239
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:30,921
for you.

240
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,487
Hold it.
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:36,834
The surprise is a new swing set.
If you could play it less intense.

242
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,969
Oh, yeah. Sure, no problem.

243
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,069
Just hold on one second.

244
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,837
Hey, Timmy.

245
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,347
I've got a surprise for you!

246
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,608
Oh, my God!

247
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:04,157
So that's why I feed my dog
Purina One.

248
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,491
Pick up a bag today.

249
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,994
-That's where you pick up the bag.
-Exactly.

250
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:16,130
The line is, "Pick up a bag,"
so you need to pick up the bag.

251
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,368
Or I could just point to it.

252
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:24,672
Purina One. Point to a bag today.

253
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,321
I didn't get it, did I?

254
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,196
Joey Tribbiani.

255
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,728
I'm here to audition for "Man."

256
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,160
You mean "Dying Man."

257
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,868
-Do it one more time.
-Really? Really? Okay.

258
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:59,041
Hello, Ross? This is Dr. McNeely
from the Fake Accent University.

259
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,718
We'd like you
to come onboard full-time!

260
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,523
Listen to this!

261
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,321
My reading was wrong.
I'm not going to die.

262
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,860
Really? How do you know?

263
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,531
My psychic is dead!

264
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,737
She must have read
the cards wrong.

265
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,528
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,434
Better her than me.

267
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,010
Hey, let's bake cookies!

268
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,081
Listen, I'm really glad
you got the part.

269
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,683
Are you sure you can do this?

270
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,087
And thanks for coming with me.

271
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,259
And thanks again
for helping me take a shower.

272
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,964
Now, is that
"never talking about it again"?

273
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,727
We're ready for you.

274
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,065
This is Alex.
He'll be playing your son.

275
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,399
Hi, Alex.

276
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,600
As you can see, my hands
are not in my pants.

277
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,443
All right, Alex.
Now, when Joey says his line...

278
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,382
"Take good care of your mama, son,"
that's your cue to cry. Got it?

279
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,090
All right, let's do this.

280
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,624
Scene five, take one.

281
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,428
And action!

282
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,898
Take good care of your mama, son.

283
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,273
Take good care of your mama, son.

284
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,310
Come on, son.

285
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,980
Your mama's good people.

286
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:47,792
Cut! Alex, remember, you're
supposed to cry.

287
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,153
Can you cry for us this time?

288
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,630
All right. From the top.

289
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,768
Scene five, take two.

290
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,300
Take 36 is up.

291
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,034
Let's try this again.

292
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,535
You ready, Joe?

293
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,472
One thing, is it all right
if I scream...

294
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,613
right up until
you say, "Action"?

295
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,949
Sure.

296
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,113
-Action!
-Take good care of your mama, son.

297
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:20,984
Cut!

298
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:26,530
I'm sorry. Why don't you lift up your
shirt? Take a look at this, kiddo.

299
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,002
We have a crying child!
Roll the damn cameras!

300
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,170
-Hello, is Ross there?
-No, he's not. Can I take a message?

301
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,883
Yes, this is Russell,
Ross' divorce lawyer.

302
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:50,520
Since I haven't heard from him, I
assume he's giving the marriage a try.

303
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,580
Ross got married again?

304
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,827
All right, keep going.
We are phasing the accent out.

305
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,692
Phasing it out.

306
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:06,837
"So without retesting their results
in the laboratory...

307
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,569
the team would never
have identified...

308
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:17,238
the initial errors
in their carbon dating...

309
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,074
analysis."

310
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,378
Were there any questions
at this point?

311
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,258
What's happening to your accent?

312
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,031
Come again? What's this nonsense?

313
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,866
All right. I'm not English.

314
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,407
I'm from Long lsland.

315
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,369
I was really nervous,
and the accent...

316
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,137
just came out.

317
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,105
I'm sorry.

318
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,920
So if we could just
get back to the lecture.

319
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,918
Were there any questions?

320
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,221
About paleontology?

321
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,295
I was just trying to make
a good first impression.

322
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:14,733
Obviously, I screwed up. But what
you guys think of me is important...

323
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,999
because I'm hoping to get
a permanent job here.

324
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:22,475
So if you'd just give me another
chance to make a good impression..

325
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,308
Ross! Are you crazy?

326
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,678
I am still your wife?
Were you just never gonna tell me?

327
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,184
What the hell is wrong with you?

328
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,515
I could just kill you!

329
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,625
Well, hello, Rachel!

330
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,234
You've really done this before?

331
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,537
You just take a big, big swing, okay?

332
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,577
Now, don't hold back.

333
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,542
What are you doing?

334
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:06,381
We're just celebrating that Joey
got his health insurance back.

335
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,248
Oh, all right.

336
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,964
See? Now let's try one without the helmet.
