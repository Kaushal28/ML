1
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:15,484
Okay, Ross.

2
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:19,222
I realize that you didn't expect
to walk in and see that, but....

3
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:22,959
- Let me explain, okay?
- We weren't doing anything!

4
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:25,769
Rach, he just saw us.

5
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:32,577
But what you saw,
that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.

6
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:36,406
- That's a lie! We also kissed in Barbados.
- Dude, chill!

7
00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:40,777
Okay, we also kissed in Barbados...

8
00:00:40,953 --> 00:00:43,854
...but we didn't plan it.
The only reason that that happened...

9
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:45,785
...was because I saw you kiss Charlie.

10
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:49,689
Yeah, you started it!
I have got to chill.

11
00:00:51,863 --> 00:00:56,562
Look, we probably should have talked to
you about this before it ever happened.

12
00:00:56,735 --> 00:01:00,193
- But....
- Oh, we feel so terrible about this, Ross.

13
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:03,603
Yeah. But it did happen.

14
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:05,574
So....

15
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:12,272
Ross?

16
00:01:20,592 --> 00:01:22,253
Ross?

17
00:01:25,263 --> 00:01:27,754
Can we just close the door?

18
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:06,600
Ross, say something.

19
00:02:06,772 --> 00:02:08,239
Anything.

20
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:11,842
So you two are...?

21
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:14,435
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,573
And have you had...?

23
00:02:17,749 --> 00:02:20,741
- No. No, no, no.
- No. No.

24
00:02:20,986 --> 00:02:23,250
But if I hadn't walked in here,
would you...?

25
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:25,388
Probably--
No. No.

26
00:02:27,893 --> 00:02:30,726
Ross, this is not how we wanted you
to find out about this.

27
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:32,863
You have every right
to go nuts.

28
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:35,295
I'm not going nuts.
Do you see me going nuts?

29
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:37,367
No, but you know what I mean.

30
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:44,474
If you two are happy...

31
00:02:44,643 --> 00:02:47,840
...then I'm happy for you.

32
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,841
I'm fine.

33
00:02:52,117 --> 00:02:54,312
- Really?
- Absolutely.

34
00:02:54,486 --> 00:02:56,852
I'm fine.

35
00:02:57,189 --> 00:02:58,781
Totally fine.

36
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:02,393
I don't know why it's coming out
all loud and squeaky...

37
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:05,586
...because, really, I'm fine.

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,168
I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised
to see you guys kissing.

39
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:16,671
I mean, at first I was like:

40
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:23,474
But now that I've had time
to absorb it....

41
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:26,374
Loving this.

42
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:31,647
- Ross--
- It's all working out.

43
00:03:32,257 --> 00:03:35,420
Me and Charlie.
And you two.

44
00:03:35,594 --> 00:03:38,722
- You know what we should do?
- Calm ourselves?

45
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:40,829
No.

46
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:43,095
We should all have dinner.

47
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:46,328
Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.
I'll cook!

48
00:03:46,805 --> 00:03:49,205
Look, don't you think
that would be a little weird?

49
00:03:49,374 --> 00:03:51,308
Weird? What? What's weird?

50
00:03:51,476 --> 00:03:54,775
The only thing weird would be
if someone didn't like Mexican food...

51
00:03:54,946 --> 00:03:56,971
...because I'm making fajitas!

52
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:06,717
I do like fajitas.

53
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,961
God, this adoption stuff
is so overwhelming.

54
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:15,691
There's inter-country adoption,
dependency adoption.

55
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:19,769
There's so many ways to go, and this is,
like, the biggest decision of our lives.

56
00:04:19,938 --> 00:04:21,565
There's a hair in my coffee.

57
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:25,002
Hey, guys.

58
00:04:25,177 --> 00:04:28,340
Have you seen Frank Jr.?
He's meeting me here with the triplets.

59
00:04:28,513 --> 00:04:30,572
It's funny,
every time you say "triplets" ...

60
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:33,217
...l think of three hot,
blond 1 9-year-olds.

61
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:35,817
That's sweet.

62
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:37,989
Drink your hair.

63
00:04:38,757 --> 00:04:40,247
Hey, what's all this stuff?

64
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:43,120
They're brochures
from different adoption agencies.

65
00:04:43,328 --> 00:04:45,694
Babies! Oh, this one is so cute.

66
00:04:45,864 --> 00:04:47,695
Get this one.

67
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,229
That's not really how it works.

68
00:04:50,435 --> 00:04:53,199
- Oh, how does it work?
- I don't know!

69
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,408
If you're having a hard time,
you should talk to my friends...

70
00:04:57,576 --> 00:05:00,739
...Bill and Colleen. They adopted
a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.

71
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:02,573
Thanks, that would be great.

72
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:05,011
Hey, honey,
wouldn't that be great?

73
00:05:08,787 --> 00:05:11,620
All right, all right.
Remember what we talked about.

74
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,782
When we're in a public place,
there are certain rules.

75
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:18,028
That's not what we talked about!

76
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,729
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi.

77
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,765
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

78
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:26,460
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi. Hey, how you doing?

79
00:05:26,638 --> 00:05:30,472
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten
so big. Which one is which again?

80
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:33,610
Well, that's Frank Jr. Jr...

81
00:05:33,812 --> 00:05:36,906
...pulling the tampons out
of the lady's purse.

82
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:41,212
And that's Chandler
climbing on Chandler.

83
00:05:42,787 --> 00:05:45,688
That's Leslie throwing bagels at him.

84
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:49,022
She's got quite an arm there,
doesn't she? Yeah.

85
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:52,186
Hey, guys, come give me a hug.

86
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:55,260
Triplets, hug your aunt!

87
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:02,030
It's like hugging fresh cookies.

88
00:06:02,207 --> 00:06:03,435
Oh, okay.

89
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:05,337
I'm gonna eat you!

90
00:06:05,944 --> 00:06:07,138
So how you been, Frank?

91
00:06:07,312 --> 00:06:11,214
Oh, good, you know. Life is all right.
Just taking it day by day.

92
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:13,044
Seems like somebody needs something.

93
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:16,278
Oh, no. He's just trying
to pull my shoulder out of it's socket.

94
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:18,780
- Oh, my God.
- No, it's fine.

95
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:21,585
After I black out,
he tries to put it back in, so....

96
00:06:22,093 --> 00:06:25,119
"Willing to adopt triplets?" No.

97
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:32,032
Can I just say, I know we're doing this
for Ross and that's cool.

98
00:06:32,203 --> 00:06:35,832
But if it was up to me, this is not what
we'd be doing on our first date.

99
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,168
Well, what would we be doing?

100
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:40,470
I'd take you out
for a romantic night.

101
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:45,673
Some champagne, fancy dinner,
feel you up on the carriage ride home.

102
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:48,318
Feel me up?

103
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,317
In a carriage.

104
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:55,585
Well, maybe we can have our date
later on tonight.

105
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,354
You know, after this,
we'll go back to our apartment....

106
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,690
Right, right. Yeah.

107
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:05,268
We could put on some music,
light some candles, and then....

108
00:07:05,637 --> 00:07:07,730
You want to say feel me up,
don't you?

109
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:09,965
I just think it's something we should do.

110
00:07:11,076 --> 00:07:12,600
- Hey, Charlie!
- Hi.

111
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:14,574
- Hi.
- Hey.

112
00:07:14,746 --> 00:07:15,974
So...

113
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:18,942
- ...dreading this?
- Oh, you bet.

114
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:22,050
So did you bring
a little something for Ross?

115
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,849
Actually, it's some stuff you left
at my apartment.

116
00:07:26,524 --> 00:07:28,754
Well, thanks.

117
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,451
And you can just give me
my stuff whenever you want.

118
00:07:32,163 --> 00:07:34,393
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.

119
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,567
I thought I heard voices.

120
00:07:41,973 --> 00:07:43,565
Hi, Charlie.

121
00:07:43,942 --> 00:07:46,308
Hey, Joey.

122
00:07:46,644 --> 00:07:50,637
And, oh, you're gonna have
to introduce me to your new girlfriend.

123
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:56,611
I'm just kidding. I know Rachel.
I know....

124
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,420
Come. Please come in.
Come in.

125
00:08:01,593 --> 00:08:03,823
Okay.
Well, we brought you some wine.

126
00:08:05,563 --> 00:08:07,622
That is so thoughtful.

127
00:08:07,832 --> 00:08:09,993
She's a keeper.

128
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:14,271
- And what did you bring me, huh?
- Actually, that's--

129
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:16,463
Underwear, a toothbrush...

130
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:18,768
...and a Van Halen CD.

131
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,571
I can use all these things!

132
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:25,281
Gosh, Ross, you know,
you seem a little--

133
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:27,849
What? Fine? Because I am.

134
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:30,351
Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't--?
You see?

135
00:08:30,522 --> 00:08:32,649
Who else is fine?

136
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,622
Come on.

137
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:37,886
Listen. Why don't you try to relax.
Maybe have a drink.

138
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:39,961
You know what,
that is a very good idea.

139
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:42,725
I'm gonna go make
a pitcher of margaritas.

140
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:50,196
Oh, God.

141
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:52,169
So adorable.

142
00:08:52,343 --> 00:08:55,312
Look at them,
sleeping there like angels.

143
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,211
Yeah, I really cherish
these moments...

144
00:08:59,384 --> 00:09:02,911
...because before you know it,
they're gonna be awake again.

145
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:06,416
Well, they may be a handful...

146
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:08,582
- ...but they're so cute.
- Yeah.

147
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:12,320
Oh, God, last time I babysat them,
they did the funniest thing.

148
00:09:12,497 --> 00:09:15,557
I haven't slept in four years.

149
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:19,666
That's a long time.

150
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:22,136
You just don't know
how hard it is, Phoebe.

151
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,103
There's just so many of them.

152
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:25,936
You know, two I could handle.

153
00:09:26,144 --> 00:09:28,669
Two's great.
You just hold one in each hand.

154
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:32,214
What do I do when the third one runs
at me with his bike helmet on?

155
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:35,216
I got no more hands
to protect my area.

156
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:38,384
There's three of them, Phoebe.
Three.

157
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,614
Yeah, I know, Frank.

158
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:43,090
I counted them when they
were coming out of my area.

159
00:09:44,762 --> 00:09:47,458
Sometimes, I think that--

160
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:52,263
Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it.
It's too horrible. No.

161
00:09:53,771 --> 00:09:55,102
What?

162
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:57,433
No, no, I can't.

163
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:02,205
Oh, my God, Frank.
Are you thinking of leaving?

164
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,543
Because I didn't have those triplets
so you could run out on them.

165
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,049
Oh, no, I would never do that.
No. I just...

166
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:13,850
...was thinking that, you know,
maybe you could take one.

167
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:15,720
What?

168
00:10:16,394 --> 00:10:20,228
You can't separate them, that's terrible!
Which one?

169
00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:26,760
Thank you so much for seeing us.

170
00:10:26,938 --> 00:10:29,133
Phoebe has told us great things
about you guys.

171
00:10:29,307 --> 00:10:30,934
Please, we're happy to help.

172
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:33,733
We went through the same thing
when we were adopting.

173
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:38,008
So a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees
and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?

174
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:46,652
I mean, you have a lovely home.

175
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:49,125
We appreciate anything
you can tell us.

176
00:10:49,294 --> 00:10:52,752
Well, actually,
I think this might help.

177
00:10:52,964 --> 00:10:53,988
It's pretty much...

178
00:10:54,165 --> 00:10:56,326
- ...all the information you need.
- Oh, my God.

179
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:59,334
Everything is broken into categories,
then cross-referenced.

180
00:10:59,504 --> 00:11:02,337
Then color-coded to correspond
with the forms in the back.

181
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,632
Thank you.

182
00:11:04,008 --> 00:11:06,135
I think I just had a tiny orgasm.

183
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:13,784
I know the process is frustrating,
but it's so worth it.

184
00:11:13,952 --> 00:11:17,012
Adopting Owen was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

185
00:11:17,222 --> 00:11:19,452
That's great. Can I see the book?

186
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:23,718
You want me to wash
my hands first, don't you?

187
00:11:23,962 --> 00:11:26,954
Please. It's just so pretty and white.

188
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:30,300
Bathroom is down the hall to your left.

189
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:33,064
I would have told him to do it too.

190
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:35,363
Can I adopt you?

191
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:39,836
- Hey, you must be Owen.
- Yeah.

192
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:42,569
I'm Chandler.
Hey, I was in the Scouts too.

193
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:46,342
- You were?
- In fact, my father was a den mother.

194
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:50,017
You know how to use a compass?

195
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:51,752
I have a badge in it.

196
00:11:51,956 --> 00:11:54,186
- You do? That's fantastic.
- You want to see it?

197
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:56,759
I'd love to, but I gotta get back
to your parents.

198
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:59,226
They're telling us
about how they adopted you.

199
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:01,024
What?

200
00:12:07,071 --> 00:12:08,834
What?

201
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:12,267
I'm adopted?

202
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:15,570
I got nothing.

203
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:20,982
I'm adopted?

204
00:12:22,287 --> 00:12:24,255
No.

205
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:27,350
I didn't say that. I said...

206
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:29,857
...you're a doctor.

207
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:32,620
A doctor.

208
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:37,166
Hey, doctor, my arm hurts.
Can you fix it for me?

209
00:12:38,202 --> 00:12:40,796
I can't believe I'm adopted.

210
00:12:40,972 --> 00:12:43,998
So you're not gonna fix my arm?

211
00:12:49,347 --> 00:12:53,511
Well, that first batch of margaritas
was not so great...

212
00:12:53,718 --> 00:12:57,119
...but this second batch is good.

213
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:02,156
Well, maybe the next batch,
we could all get some.

214
00:13:02,393 --> 00:13:04,725
Oh, God, this is fun, isn't it?

215
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:07,160
You know, just the four of us.

216
00:13:07,332 --> 00:13:09,163
Just hanging.

217
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,294
Dude, are you okay?

218
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:13,403
And when are the fajitas
gonna be ready?

219
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:17,931
I'm fine, okay? I'm great.

220
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:21,078
I'm just--
I'm just proud of us.

221
00:13:21,245 --> 00:13:24,681
You know?
There's no weirdness, no tension.

222
00:13:24,882 --> 00:13:26,873
No awareness.

223
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:30,986
We make a great foursome.
We should do more stuff together.

224
00:13:31,923 --> 00:13:33,857
Let's take a trip!

225
00:13:35,593 --> 00:13:37,356
We could all go on your boat.

226
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:40,326
Joey has this amazing sailboat.

227
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:42,830
Actually, Ross, I sold the boat
two years ago.

228
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,093
Oh, no. Idiot!

229
00:13:46,904 --> 00:13:48,804
Well, yeah, but I could get another one.

230
00:13:48,973 --> 00:13:51,567
- This trip sounds great.
- Yeah?

231
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,439
Okay, where do you think we can go?

232
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:56,842
My fajitas!

233
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:02,712
Look, Charlie,
I just want you to know...

234
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:06,983
...Ross is just having a little trouble
adjusting to the thought of Joey and me.

235
00:14:07,158 --> 00:14:09,388
You know, he normally
doesn't drink like this.

236
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:12,858
You know what, this is nothing.
My father is a raging alcoholic.

237
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:19,229
I'm sorry, have I made
this evening uncomfortable?

238
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:25,807
Fajitas! Be careful!
Very hot plate! Very hot!

239
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:27,968
Ross, you don't
even have oven mitts on.

240
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:34,313
That is gonna hurt tomorrow.

241
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:38,811
Okay, well, this is crazy.

242
00:14:39,023 --> 00:14:42,515
We can't seriously be talking about me
taking one of your kids, can we?

243
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:44,251
Oh, no, of course we're not.

244
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:46,090
- That's insane.
- I know.

245
00:14:46,264 --> 00:14:47,731
Alice would never go for it.

246
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:51,163
She's pretty tired too.
I think we could get her on board.

247
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:57,207
Well, just for argument's sake,
you know, hypothetically...

248
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,468
...which one
would you be willing to give up?

249
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:03,069
Frank Jr. Jr.?

250
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:05,477
Well, it'd be great for my shoulder.

251
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,311
You'd be getting a really good one.

252
00:15:07,485 --> 00:15:08,782
He's really funny.

253
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:11,217
Like, the other day,
he made up this joke:

254
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:14,051
What's green and says,
"Hey, I'm a frog"?

255
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:17,620
A talking frog.

256
00:15:19,797 --> 00:15:23,062
Oh, no, you can't have him,
he's too funny.

257
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:26,770
Well, all right, that's fine.
What about Leslie?

258
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:29,098
Oh, no, no, not Leslie. No.

259
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:32,970
She's the only one that knows how
to burp the alphabet.

260
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:36,007
All right, so that leaves Chandler.

261
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:39,444
No, no, you can't have Chandler.
No, no. She's my little genius.

262
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,117
I got big hopes for her.

263
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:45,016
She's gonna be a doctor
or a realtor.

264
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:51,524
Wow, Frank,
I think we just ran out of kids.

265
00:15:52,797 --> 00:15:54,788
Oh, I think you're right.

266
00:15:57,768 --> 00:16:02,432
Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think
I can give one of them up.

267
00:16:02,607 --> 00:16:06,338
I mean, you know, they drive me crazy,
but they're my babies.

268
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,145
I'm sorry, Frank,
I didn't realize things were so bad.

269
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:15,547
You know, I'll help out more.
I can baby-sit anytime you want.

270
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:17,380
You name the day and I'll be there.

271
00:16:17,555 --> 00:16:19,955
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, that's not good.

272
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,052
But I can move some stuff around
and I'll be there.

273
00:16:24,262 --> 00:16:26,423
You and Alice just take
the whole day together.

274
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:28,622
You'd do that for us?

275
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,063
Are you kidding?
That's what sisters are for.

276
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:39,474
Oh, look at them.

277
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:43,378
I love you so much.

278
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:47,175
Oh, crap, don't wake up!
Don't wake up!

279
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:53,215
- Where are Bill and Colleen?
- Kitchen, getting something to eat.

280
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:54,915
Can you believe
how nice they are?

281
00:16:55,092 --> 00:16:56,423
We have to leave.

282
00:16:58,062 --> 00:17:00,997
Why?
What did you do in the bathroom?

283
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:03,998
I didn't get to the bathroom.
I bumped into Owen on the way.

284
00:17:04,168 --> 00:17:06,898
He didn't know he was adopted.
There's a slight chance...

285
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,436
...l may have told him.

286
00:17:08,906 --> 00:17:12,137
Oh, my God, where's my purse?
No, I can replace everything in there.

287
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,744
- Get that binder and let's go!
- Hi.

288
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:17,447
Some little snacks for everybody.

289
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:20,607
You don't have to eat the sour worms.
Those are for Owen.

290
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:22,675
I'll go get him in a second.

291
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:26,186
By the way, you should know,
we haven't told him he's adopted yet.

292
00:17:26,924 --> 00:17:29,051
But kids are so intuitive.

293
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:31,558
Don't you think, on some level,
he already knows?

294
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:35,095
- I'm adopted?
- See? Intuitive.

295
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:37,624
What? Where did you hear that?

296
00:17:37,868 --> 00:17:38,960
He told me.

297
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:44,132
And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.

298
00:17:44,742 --> 00:17:47,370
Which, technically,
now you should give back.

299
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,348
You told him he's adopted?

300
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:55,144
I'm sorry. You should have
a sign out there or something.

301
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:58,481
Or at least whisper it to people
when they come in the door.

302
00:17:58,656 --> 00:18:02,148
"Owen doesn't know he's adopted,
and he also thinks Santa is real."

303
00:18:02,393 --> 00:18:04,122
He isn't?

304
00:18:05,296 --> 00:18:07,662
We have to get out of here, baby.

305
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,531
What is the matter with you?

306
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:13,761
All right, look, I know
what Chandler did was not the best...

307
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:17,840
...but anyone would assume that
a 1 2-year-old has been told he's adopted.

308
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:21,570
- Yeah, he's 8.
- Wow, he's tall.

309
00:18:21,979 --> 00:18:23,571
What country did you get him from?

310
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,077
Everyone, I would like
to make a toast...

311
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:33,188
...to Rachel and Joey.

312
00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:38,218
And to love.

313
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:42,296
Ah, love!

314
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:46,666
L-O-V-E. Love.

315
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:48,964
L is for "life."

316
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,734
And what is life without love?

317
00:18:52,743 --> 00:18:55,337
Oh, my God, are we supposed
to answer?

318
00:18:56,847 --> 00:19:00,112
O is for:

319
00:19:01,085 --> 00:19:03,246
"Oh, wow!"

320
00:19:06,157 --> 00:19:09,752
The V is for this...

321
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:13,920
...very surprising turn of events...

322
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:17,792
...which I am still fine with,
by the way.

323
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,661
E...

324
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:26,272
...is for how...

325
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:30,380
...extremely normal I find it...

326
00:19:30,548 --> 00:19:32,675
...that you two...

327
00:19:33,851 --> 00:19:35,182
...are together.

328
00:19:37,354 --> 00:19:40,846
And that one day
you might get married...

329
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:46,028
...and have children of your own.

330
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:53,632
- Dude, are you okay?
- Totally.

331
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:56,637
Ross, you don't seem okay.

332
00:19:56,841 --> 00:20:00,299
I'm sorry, it must be
the pressure of entertaining.

333
00:20:03,848 --> 00:20:07,477
I think everyone would
feel better if we had some flan.

334
00:20:08,018 --> 00:20:11,317
Wait, Ross. Ross, l--
I have to take off.

335
00:20:11,522 --> 00:20:13,387
- No!
- I'm sorry.

336
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:16,151
I have an early class in the morning.

337
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:19,728
But this has been lovely.

338
00:20:20,664 --> 00:20:24,532
Wasn't it? And you thought it
would be awkward with Joey.

339
00:20:24,702 --> 00:20:27,102
And that you never
really liked Rachel.

340
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:32,432
You are on fire!
I'll call you in the morning, okay?

341
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,305
- Okay.
- All right.

342
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:39,608
God, Rachel, what Ross just said,
that's just--

343
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:42,150
That's okay.
Girls tend not to like me.

344
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,815
Fine.

345
00:20:46,991 --> 00:20:50,688
Okay. I guess it's just flan for three.

346
00:20:52,897 --> 00:20:54,694
Hey, that rhymes.

347
00:20:57,234 --> 00:21:00,101
You know what, Ross,
I think we're gonna take off too.

348
00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:05,197
Of course. God, I'm so stupid.

349
00:21:05,376 --> 00:21:06,900
You guys are a couple now.

350
00:21:07,077 --> 00:21:09,545
I mean, you probably
just want to be alone.

351
00:21:09,747 --> 00:21:13,376
- No, it's just getting late--
- It's fine. It's totally fine.

352
00:21:13,551 --> 00:21:16,486
I've got plenty of margaritas.
It's all good.

353
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:25,492
I don't even know what that's for.

354
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:32,593
You know what?

355
00:21:32,903 --> 00:21:35,929
I think I'm gonna stay here
and make sure he's okay.

356
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,268
- That's probably a good idea.
- I'll see you in the morning.

357
00:21:39,443 --> 00:21:40,933
Okay.

358
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:43,238
Yeah, you know, Joey, l--

359
00:21:43,414 --> 00:21:46,906
I don't think he's ever
gonna be okay with this.

360
00:21:47,117 --> 00:21:49,312
It doesn't look good, does it?

361
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:07,635
I guess I made Tater Tots.

362
00:22:10,174 --> 00:22:11,971
Ross, oven mitts!

363
00:22:26,924 --> 00:22:28,118
Morning.

364
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:30,987
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

365
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:35,093
- Did you stay here all night?
- Yeah.

366
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,692
So you took off my pants and shoes?

367
00:22:39,904 --> 00:22:41,462
No. No, no.

368
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:45,769
You actually did that when you
were dancing to the <i>Chicago</i> soundtrack.

369
00:22:47,845 --> 00:22:51,042
Look, Ross...

370
00:22:51,248 --> 00:22:54,684
...about Rachel and l. Listen, you don't
have to worry about that...

371
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:57,150
...because nothing's gonna happen.

372
00:22:57,354 --> 00:22:59,686
What do you mean?

373
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,885
She and I said from the beginning...

374
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:04,994
...we weren't gonna do anything
unless you were okay with it.

375
00:23:05,162 --> 00:23:06,652
And clearly--

376
00:23:06,864 --> 00:23:09,560
What are you talking about?
I'm fine.

377
00:23:11,035 --> 00:23:13,367
- Are we still doing this?
- No.

378
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:17,802
It's okay, Ross.
You know, I totally understand.

379
00:23:17,975 --> 00:23:20,739
Of course you're not fine. You're....

380
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:24,076
You're Ross and Rachel.

381
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,209
Yeah, except we're not.

382
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:32,518
I mean, we haven't been
a couple in, like...

383
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:36,789
...six years.

384
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:40,991
My God, is that right?

385
00:23:41,832 --> 00:23:43,231
Has it been that long?

386
00:23:44,134 --> 00:23:46,500
That's what I hear, yeah.

387
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:51,805
This is crazy.
I mean, six years...

388
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:55,241
...and because of me,
you guys aren't gonna be together?

389
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,545
Can I ask you something?

390
00:23:58,716 --> 00:24:00,183
Really...

391
00:24:01,118 --> 00:24:03,643
...what is this thing
with you and Rachel?

392
00:24:05,656 --> 00:24:09,456
Come on, you know me.
You know....

393
00:24:10,828 --> 00:24:11,886
Joey.

394
00:24:18,535 --> 00:24:20,662
I'm crazy about her.

395
00:24:26,043 --> 00:24:28,534
And she feels the same way?

396
00:24:30,781 --> 00:24:32,612
I think so.

397
00:24:35,252 --> 00:24:36,844
Well, then...

398
00:24:37,021 --> 00:24:39,216
...maybe it's time
we all moved on.

399
00:24:39,757 --> 00:24:42,351
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean,
you're not okay with it, so--

400
00:24:42,526 --> 00:24:45,859
No, but I want to be.

401
00:24:47,898 --> 00:24:49,490
I will be.

402
00:24:52,569 --> 00:24:55,163
Besides, I'm with Charlie, right?

403
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:57,830
Oh, my God,
I'm still with Charlie, aren't l?

404
00:24:58,008 --> 00:25:00,704
- She didn't see the dance, did she?
- No, no, no.

405
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:05,545
No, that was--
That was just for me.

406
00:25:09,153 --> 00:25:10,916
Hey, you...?

407
00:25:11,088 --> 00:25:13,022
You sure about this?

408
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,886
Yeah, I'm sure.

409
00:25:18,195 --> 00:25:19,526
And...

410
00:25:20,464 --> 00:25:22,455
...we're okay?

411
00:25:34,144 --> 00:25:35,736
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

412
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:37,938
We just want to give
you a heads up.

413
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:40,447
- Bill and Colleen hate us.
- Why?

414
00:25:40,617 --> 00:25:43,051
Owen didn't know he's adopted
and Monica told him.

415
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,778
What?

416
00:25:44,955 --> 00:25:48,083
- He didn't know? He's 12.
- No, he's only 8.

417
00:25:48,258 --> 00:25:50,317
I'll bet he's Russian.

418
00:25:50,494 --> 00:25:52,587
Still, he had to find out sometime.

419
00:25:52,763 --> 00:25:56,927
How would you like it if someone told
the triplets that you gave birth to them?

420
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:03,836
I'm gonna go tell Emma
she was an accident.
