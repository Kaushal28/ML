1
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:06,664
Hey! You're not gonna believe this.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,243
Yes, Ross, we know they have magazines
with pictures of naked women in them.

3
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,470
Don't tell him about the videos!

4
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:17,644
I made up a joke
and sent it in to Playboy.

5
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,441
They printed it.

6
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,812
I didn't know they print jokes.

7
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,821
They print jokes, interviews,
hard-hitting journalism.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,824
It's not just about the pictures.

9
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,553
Didn't work on Mom,
it's not gonna work on us.

10
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,829
Check it out. It's the first one.

11
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,599
Right there.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,468
That is funny.

13
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,834
It was also funny when I made it up.

14
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,980
-What?
-I made that joke up.

15
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,081
No, you didn't. I did.

16
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:54,777
Yes, I did. I told Dan and he said it
was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.

17
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,012
Hey, tell Dan thanks.

18
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,586
What?

19
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:06,527
I was just reading the joke below it.
Man, that one is funny.

20
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,199
Monica, you remember me
telling you that joke, right?

21
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,266
-No.
-Seriously?

22
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,538
You tell a lot of jokes.

23
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,538
Look, it's my joke.

24
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:23,214
But if it makes you feel better,
they don't print the name.

25
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,883
So it doesn't really matter
who gets credit.

26
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,484
Yeah, I guess.

27
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,020
-Hey, guys.
-Playboy printed my joke!

28
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:33,056
No, it's mine! Call them!
They'll tell you!

29
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,350
-My joke!
-My joke!

30
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,026
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

31
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,093
Jokes? What...?

32
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,858
You know there's naked chicks
in there, right?

33
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,296
The One With The Joke

34
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:24,038
Dude! You have got to turn on
Behind The Music.

35
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:27,872
The band Heart is having a tough
time and they may break up.

36
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,082
Let's watch that at your place.

37
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,719
Monica's watching a show. I don't
want to miss when they were skinny.

38
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,912
Hey, Chandler?
You know what we should do?

39
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:40,784
You and I should go out
and get some new sunglasses.

40
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,459
What? No, I want to watch this.

41
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,996
-Did your cable go out?
-No. No, that's VH1.

42
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,100
I tell you, the music
these kids listen to today...

43
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,796
it's a lot of noise to me.

44
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,739
Why is your cable out?

45
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,575
Oh, because I haven't really
paid the bill.

46
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:06,279
If you need money,
would you please let me loan you some?

47
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,952
No, Chandler. Forget about it, okay?

48
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,148
I know things have been tight since
Janine moved out. God, was she hot.

49
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,188
I know, yeah.

50
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:19,420
Look, I can handle it, all right?
I can listen to the radio.

51
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,658
And Ross gave me this great book.

52
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,098
Want to see if the joke stealer
will let us watch at his place?

53
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,602
Sure.

54
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,177
-Paid your phone bill?
-No.

55
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,016
It's only you.

56
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,385
-What are you doing?
-Looking at a Playboy.

57
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,786
I want to look too!

58
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,396
Yikes!

59
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,368
Do you think these pictures
are trying to tell a story?

60
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,634
Sure. Like in the case
of this young woman...

61
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,138
she has lost her clothes.

62
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:09,371
So she rides naked on the horse,
she's crying out, "Where are they?"

63
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,017
She's not gonna find them,
lying in the grass like that.

64
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,216
Remember the days when you'd
go out to the barn...

65
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,587
Lift up your shirt and bend over?

66
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,895
You see, now, I would date this girl.

67
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,732
She's cute, she's outdoorsy.

68
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,168
And she knows how to build a fire.
That'll come in handy.

69
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:38,901
I got a question.

70
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,771
If you had to pick one of us to date,
who would it be?

71
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,343
-I don't know.
-Me neither.

72
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:46,950
Rachel.

73
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,111
What?

74
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,623
I don't know.

75
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,690
Me neither.

76
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:02,592
You know, you forget how many
great songs Heart had.

77
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,238
"Barracuda" was the first song
I learned to play on the keyboard.

78
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,971
So you heard it, you repeated it...

79
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,941
so that must mean you wrote it.

80
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,747
You guys with this joke.
Well, I gotta say...

81
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,783
I know I cracked up,
but I'm not even sure I got it.

82
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,450
What?

83
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,455
You didn't get it?

84
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,389
The doctor is a monkey.

85
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,056
And monkeys
can't write out prescriptions.

86
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,263
You are not allowed
to laugh at my joke.

87
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,571
Your joke?

88
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,674
Well, I think the Hef
would disagree.

89
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,274
Which is why he sent me a check...

90
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,674
for $100.

91
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:52,248
So you stole my joke
and you stole my money?

92
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,519
I was gonna stick it in the ATM.

93
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,688
But now I think I'll show
the sexy teller...

94
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,757
that I am a published writer.

95
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,155
She'll know that you stole the joke.

96
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,919
You gonna follow me there?

97
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,962
-Yeah.
-I'm not gonna go now.

98
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,497
Okay.

99
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,669
Here you go.

100
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,002
Gunther?

101
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,011
I can't pay now,
because I'm not working.

102
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,873
I've had to cut down
on some luxuries like...

103
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,607
paying for stuff, so....

104
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,345
Well, if you want, you can work here.

105
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,451
I don't know.

106
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:32,954
It's just....

107
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,658
See, I was a regular on a soap opera,
you know?

108
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,798
And to go from that to this,
it's just....

109
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,830
And plus, I'd have to wait
on all my friends.

110
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,829
Okay. But the money's good.

111
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,904
Plus, you get to stare at Rachel
as much as you want.

112
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,873
What?

113
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,171
Flexible hours.

114
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,212
Maybe I could be a waiter.

115
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,848
Could I use the phone?

116
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,489
She picked Rachel.

117
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:12,096
She tried to back out of it, but
it was obvious. She picked Rachel.

118
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,431
He took my joke. He just took it.

119
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,931
This is wrong.
You know what else is wrong?

120
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,901
Phoebe picking Rachel.

121
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,039
Know who else picked Rachel? Ross.

122
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:26,109
Know what else Ross did?
He stole my joke.

123
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,113
I'm gonna get a joke journal,
you know?

124
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,784
And document the date and time
of every single one of my jokes.

125
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,284
Good idea. Know what's a bad idea?

126
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,854
-Picking Rachel.
-That's right.

127
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,061
Did you hear something?

128
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:47,392
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing
into my brain to steal my thoughts.

129
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,295
It's coming from the living room.

130
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:57,770
I finished my book.

131
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,985
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey.

132
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,279
Don't you guys look cute.

133
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,451
You guys make a cute couple.

134
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,593
What are you doing?

135
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,889
Just trying to re-create some of
the fun that we had at my place.

136
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,430
Remember? When you picked
Rachel over me?

137
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,660
That was funny.

138
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,998
-It was kind of funny.
-It wasn't funny at all!

139
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,167
Why would you do that?

140
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,344
Why didn't you pick me?

141
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:34,944
Fine.

142
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:39,274
The reason I was leaning a little
bit more toward Rachel than you...

143
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,350
is just, you know, you're...

144
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,148
high maintenance.
Let's go to lunch!

145
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,789
That is completely untrue.

146
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,324
You think I'm high maintenance?
Prove it.

147
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:53,156
You write out a list, and
we'll go through it point by point.

148
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,461
No, you're right, you're easygoing.

149
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:03,001
You're just not as easygoing
as Rachel. She's just more...

150
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,506
flexible and mellow. That's all.

151
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,143
Well, people are different.

152
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:16,279
Rachel will do whatever you want.
You can just walk all over her.

153
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,326
What? Are you saying that I'm
a pushover? I'm not a pushover.

154
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,721
Oh, okay. You're not a pushover.

155
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,166
You think I'm a pushover.
Well, watch this.

156
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,233
You're not invited to lunch!

157
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,961
What do you think?
Pretty strong, I think.

158
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,470
Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.

159
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,805
You start working on that list.

160
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:46,243
-I cannot believe her.
-I know. Where do you want to eat?

161
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:51,053
-Oh, I love that Japanese place.
-I'm sick of Japanese. Not there.

162
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,724
Wherever you want to go is cool.

163
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,026
Oh, hey, Gunther...

164
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,857
check this out.

165
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,061
Yeah, that Chandler cracks me up.

166
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,235
You want anything to drink?
I'm heading up there.

167
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,844
-I'll take a coffee. Thanks.
-Sure.

168
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,678
-Coffee?
-No.

169
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,476
Coffee? I'm going up there.

170
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:21,914
No, thank you.

171
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,890
You need anything?
I'm heading up there.

172
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,689
I'd love ice water.

173
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,383
You got it.

174
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,094
What are you doing?

175
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,730
Just being friendly.

176
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,426
You're not supposed to go back there.

177
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,069
It's okay. Right?

178
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,568
Don't wink at me.

179
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,712
And put on your apron.

180
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,910
Okay.

181
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,812
I don't see you asking other
paying customers to put on aprons.

182
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,885
-Joey, do you work here?
-No.

183
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,614
-Waiter.
-Yeah!

184
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,896
What's going on?
Why didn't you tell us you work here?

185
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:13,634
It's kind of embarrassing. I mean,
I was an actor, now I'm a waiter.

186
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,069
It's supposed to go
the other direction.

187
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:19,438
So's your apron.
You're wearing it like a cape.

188
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,908
I mean, the job's easy
and the money's good, you know?

189
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:28,075
I guess if I'm hanging out here,
I might as well get paid for it.

190
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,620
I just feel kind of weird
serving you guys, you know?

191
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:32,950
It'll be great.

192
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,625
Come on, I did it and it was fine.

193
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,386
Why would it be weird?

194
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:40,588
Hey, Joey? Can I get some coffee?

195
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,793
It doesn't seem that weird.

196
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,733
I asked before.
You still haven't gotten it.

197
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,636
See, now it's weird again.

198
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,779
You're gonna make a lot of money.
Here's your first tip.

199
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,343
Don't eat yellow snow.

200
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,515
2:15, coffeehouse.

201
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,621
This is great. Finally,
someone I can pass my wisdom to.

202
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,762
Let me tell you some things
I learned working here.

203
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,023
First, the customer is always right.

204
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,759
A smile goes a long way.

205
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:24,169
And if anyone is ever rude to you,
sneeze muffin.

206
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,203
Thanks, Rach.

207
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,949
Hey, look, you guys are just terrific,
you know?

208
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,278
How about clearing out
so I can get some new customers?

209
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,547
It's all about turnover.

210
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,727
Seriously, can I get my coffee?

211
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,321
I'm sorry. I'll get it right now.

212
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,665
And since you waited,
I'll toss in a free muffin.

213
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,066
Phoebe, we'd like to talk to you.

214
00:12:58,677 --> 00:12:59,905
Okay.

215
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,239
So, maybe I am
a little high maintenance.

216
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,383
And maybe Rachel is
a little bit of a pushover.

217
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,313
But you know what you are?

218
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:12,251
We are sorry to tell you this,
but you, Phoebe, are flaky.

219
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,559
That's true, I am flaky.

220
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,660
So, what, you're just okay
with being flaky?

221
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,494
Yeah, totally.

222
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,896
Then I'm okay
with being high maintenance.

223
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:31,008
Yeah. And I am okay
with being a pushover.

224
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,571
That's great. Good for you guys.

225
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,010
-I am not high maintenance!
-I am not a pushover!

226
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,747
-Who said you were?
-You did!

227
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,387
I'm flaky. I'll say anything.

228
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:50,859
Hey, Gunther.

229
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,429
Can you cover for me?
I got an audition.

230
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,234
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.

231
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,934
I like your natural color.

232
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:05,910
It's a great part.
I'm the lead guy's best friend.

233
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,477
I wait for him and save his seat.
Listen.

234
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,813
"I'm sorry, that seat's saved."

235
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:18,082
-That's the whole part?
-Maybe he's not his best friend.

236
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,550
I'll see you.

237
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,451
Oh, man.

238
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:26,461
I could totally get that part.
"I'm sorry, this seat is taken."

239
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,997
-Excuse me.
-No, I didn't mean you.

240
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,566
But you believed me?

241
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,601
I believed you were saving this seat
for someone.

242
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:37,966
So you'd hire me, right?

243
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,842
For what?

244
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:44,109
Exactly!
All right, everybody listen up!

245
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,080
The coffeehouse will be closed
for about an hour.

246
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,446
What?

247
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,321
It's for the kids.

248
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,287
Yeah, to keep the kids off drugs.

249
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:58,121
It's a very important issue
in this month's Playboy.

250
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,195
I'm sure you all read about it.

251
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,395
Hey! Don't you wanna keep guns
away from kids?

252
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,735
-You said, "drugs."
-It's a vicious cycle. Get out!

253
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,102
Go!

254
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,121
-It's my joke.
-It's my joke.

255
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,161
It's my joke.

256
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,998
I don't think we're gonna settle this.

257
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,899
Let's have Monica decide.

258
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,164
-Hey, Mon!
-Get out here!

259
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,376
-Monica?
-Okay.

260
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,908
You have to decide whose joke this is.

261
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,170
Why do I have to?

262
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,541
You're the only one that can be fair.

263
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,681
I can't be. You're my boyfriend.

264
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,012
But I'm your brother. We're family.

265
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:59,054
That's the most important thing
in the world.

266
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,857
Don't try to sway her.

267
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:06,096
I'm your only chance to have a baby.

268
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,402
-Okay, let's go.
-All right.

269
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,265
We'll each tell you
how we came up with the joke...

270
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:19,500
then you decide which one of us
is telling the truth. Me.

271
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,407
Chandler, you first.

272
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,047
I thought of the joke two months ago
at lunch with Steve.

273
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,775
-Did I meet him at Christmas?
-Can I finish?

274
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,520
You want me to pick you?

275
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,055
See, I would never
snap at you like that.

276
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,419
Two babies.

277
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,596
-Continue.
-Okay.

278
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:48,535
Steve said he had to go to the doctor.
And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey.

279
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:53,801
I said, "Dr. Monkey?" And that is how
the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up.

280
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,775
Are you kidding?

281
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,920
Okay, look, I study evolution.

282
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:04,554
Remember? Evolution.

283
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,381
Monkey into man.

284
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,286
Plus, I'm a doctor. And...

285
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,552
I had a monkey.

286
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,632
I'm Dr. Monkey!

287
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,736
I'm not arguing with that.

288
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,098
I've heard enough for my decision.

289
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,934
-Okay, so what..?
-Do tell.

290
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,407
You are both idiots.

291
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,642
It's not funny.
And it's offensive to women.

292
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,977
And doctors. And monkeys.

293
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,513
You shouldn't argue
over who gets credit.

294
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:42,659
You should argue over who gets blamed
for inflicting this joke on the world.

295
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,293
Now, let it go.

296
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,657
The joke sucks.

297
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,135
-It's your joke.
-It is not.

298
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:13,047
-Oh, my God, Chandler, there you are.
-Hi.

299
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,817
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel.

300
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,459
Why don't you tell them...

301
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:21,190
what you told me about me
not being high maintenance.

302
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:27,870
Monica is a self-sufficient,
together lady.

303
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,643
Being with her
has been like being on a vacation.

304
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,911
And what may be perceived
as high maintenance...

305
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,811
is merely attention to detail...

306
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,384
and...

307
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,820
generosity of spirit.

308
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:52,392
Wow. You know what? That is the best
fake speech I think I've ever heard.

309
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,359
Really? I've heard better.

310
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,494
Wait, he came up with that himself.
Tell them.

311
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,762
I'm out of words.
Should I say it again?

312
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,008
Look, I am not high maintenance!

313
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,107
I am not. Chandler!

314
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,839
You're a little high maintenance.

315
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,244
You are on my list!

316
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,844
Look, I'm sorry, but you're not..

317
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,853
You're not easygoing,
but you're passionate.

318
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,354
And that's good.

319
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:25,461
And when you get upset about little
things, I think I'm pretty good...

320
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,562
at making you feel better.

321
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,734
That's good too.
They say you're high maintenance...

322
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,597
but it's okay, because I like...

323
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,298
maintaining you.

324
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,041
I didn't tell him that.

325
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,986
-You're off my list.
-I'm off the list.

326
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:55,654
Phoebe?

327
00:19:56,895 --> 00:20:00,058
It's okay that you don't want me
to be your girlfriend.

328
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,994
I have the best boyfriend.

329
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:06,962
You know,
suddenly I find you very attractive.

330
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,632
How'd the audition go?

331
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,275
Oh, not good. No.

332
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:17,175
I didn't get the part.
And I lost my job here, so...

333
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,316
Wow, that is a bad audition.

334
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,011
Well, how did you lose your job here?

335
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,586
I had the audition...

336
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,420
but Gunther said I had to stay
so he could get his hair dyed.

337
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,788
So I went anyway, and he fired me.

338
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,932
He left work
to do a personal errand...

339
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:38,466
and left you in charge
when you've been here two days?

340
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,001
That's not right.

341
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,405
What are you gonna do?

342
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,304
You can't let him get away with that.

343
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,672
I won't let him get away with that.
I'm gonna say..

344
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:52,212
I shouldn't say anything.
No, I should say something!

345
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,648
Gunther?
I want you to give Joey his job back.

346
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:02,620
-It's not fair that you have to fire..
-Okay.

347
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,732
-What?
-He can have his job back.

348
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:13,204
That's right,
he can have his job back.

349
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,207
Glad we got that all straightened out.

350
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,875
There you go, Joey.

351
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,514
-Got your job back.
-That's great. Thanks.

352
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,582
Pretty nice, huh?
Now who's a pushover?

353
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,514
-Rach, you're in my seat.
-I'm sorry.

354
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,854
I never heard who you'd pick
to be your girlfriend.

355
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,488
-I'd pick you, Phoebe.
-Yeah, definitely you, Phoebe.

356
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,292
Yeah, I kind of thought.

357
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,633
-Never.
-It would totally be you.

358
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:55,210
If you had to pick one
of the other two to go out with...

359
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,913
who would you pick?

360
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,546
-No way.
-I'm not answering.

361
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,307
Joey.

362
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,815
No way, I'm not answering that.
