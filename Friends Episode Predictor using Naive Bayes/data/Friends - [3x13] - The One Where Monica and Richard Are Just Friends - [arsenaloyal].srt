1
00:00:03,115 --> 00:00:04,707
Hi.

2
00:00:06,485 --> 00:00:07,509
Six dollars, please.

3
00:00:07,753 --> 00:00:10,244
Six? l just had it for one night.
lt's three.

4
00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:14,050
Eight o'clock's the cutoff,
and it's 8:02.

5
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:18,457
You know, in a weird way,
you have too much power.

6
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:22,094
You have to help me out here
because l only have three.

7
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:24,802
l can help with that.

8
00:00:25,837 --> 00:00:29,000
Oh, my God. Richard?

9
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:32,335
-Hi.
-Hi.

10
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:34,206
Your lip went bald.

11
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:37,607
Thanks.

12
00:00:39,885 --> 00:00:41,352
You look great!

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,709
Right.

14
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:45,947
No, you do. You just....

15
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:47,447
What?

16
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:49,820
You got panties stuck to your leg.

17
00:00:54,132 --> 00:00:59,126
That's because l was just grabbing some
things out of the dryer, and static cling.

18
00:00:59,304 --> 00:01:03,968
Or maybe it's because God knew l'd be
running into you and saw an opportunity.

19
00:01:04,676 --> 00:01:05,802
lt's good to see you.

20
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:07,979
lt's good to see you too.

21
00:01:13,852 --> 00:01:14,876
The One Where Monica and Richard
are Just Friends

22
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:01,657
See that guy?
He's in classics now...

23
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:05,462
...but as soon as we leave,
he's going straight to the porn.

24
00:02:05,637 --> 00:02:10,267
He'll go up to the counter with Citizen
Kane, Vertigo and Clockwork Orgy.

25
00:02:14,846 --> 00:02:17,280
This is nice. l miss this.

26
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:19,817
-Yeah.
-Excuse me.

27
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:22,681
We're gonna be here for a while,
so just go back there.

28
00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:25,379
Yeah, we're not judging.

29
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:32,688
So you want to get
a hamburger or something?

30
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:34,932
l don't know if that's a good idea.

31
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:37,829
Look, just friends.
l won't grope you. l promise.

32
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:40,568
l think it's too soon.

33
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:43,741
No, it's not too soon.
l had lunch at 1 1 :00.

34
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:48,640
Yeah, baby!

35
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:52,511
-What are you doing?
-Making chocolate milk. You want some?

36
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:54,184
No, thanks. l'm 29.

37
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:57,550
Oh, my God! l gotta go to work!

38
00:02:57,756 --> 00:03:00,190
What time do you think
you're gonna get off tonight?

39
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:03,293
-l don't know. lt could be really late.
-Come on. Not again!

40
00:03:03,895 --> 00:03:06,921
l know. l'm sorry.
l'll make a deal with you, okay?

41
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:10,068
For every night that you're asleep
before l get home from work...

42
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:14,396
...l will wake you up in a way
that has proved very popular in the past.

43
00:03:14,606 --> 00:03:18,372
Well, now if you need to stay late,
l want to be supportive of that.

44
00:03:19,578 --> 00:03:22,069
-Hi.
-Hey.

45
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:24,681
Look at you.
Since when do you rollerblade?

46
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,747
Since tomorrow.

47
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,316
l met this really cute guy in the park.

48
00:03:29,488 --> 00:03:33,015
And he, like, jogs and blades
and swims, and so we made a deal.

49
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:36,888
He's gonna teach me how
to do all sorts of jock stuff.

50
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:38,821
And what are you gonna do for him?

51
00:03:38,997 --> 00:03:40,157
-l'm gonna let him.
-Okay.

52
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:41,356
Cool.

53
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:43,530
-Good morning.
-Hey.

54
00:03:43,702 --> 00:03:45,897
Somebody got in late last night.

55
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:49,073
Yeah, well, l ran into Richard.

56
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:50,768
When did this happen?

57
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:53,611
Around 8:02.

58
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:58,846
We talked for a little while, and then
we went out for an innocent burger.

59
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:01,577
There's no such thing as
an innocent burger.

60
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:04,514
-Are you gonna see him again?
-Tomorrow night.

61
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:06,553
Monica, what are you doing?

62
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:09,090
She spent the last six months
getting over him...

63
00:04:09,294 --> 00:04:13,822
...and now she's celebrating that
by going on a date with him.

64
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,824
lt's not a date, okay?

65
00:04:17,102 --> 00:04:20,731
l'm just gonna teach him how to make a
lasagna for some potluck dinner he has.

66
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:25,000
You might wanna make extra, because
you'll probably be hungry after the sex.

67
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:29,170
We're not gonna have sex.

68
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:33,579
Okay, nothing's changed here. He still
doesn't want children, and l still do.

69
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:35,743
So that's why we're gonna
just be friends.

70
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:37,648
Naked friends.

71
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,352
-Hey.
-Hey.

72
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:46,019
-Do you have any ice?
-Check the freezer.

73
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:48,666
lf there's none in there,
we're probably out.

74
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:51,161
Are you just getting home
from work? lt's late.

75
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:53,531
Yeah, l know.
l had the greatest day, though.

76
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:56,367
l got to sit in on a meeting
with reps from Calvin Klein.

77
00:04:57,075 --> 00:05:01,273
l told my boss l liked this line of lingerie.
She ordered a ton. How was your day?

78
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,012
l discovered l'm able to count all my
teeth using just my tongue.

79
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:14,152
Why do you have a copy of
The Shining in your freezer?

80
00:05:14,492 --> 00:05:17,552
l was reading it last night,
and l got scared, so....

81
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:22,259
But you're safe from it
if it's in the freezer?

82
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:24,367
Well, safer.

83
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:29,666
l never start reading The Shining without
making sure we got room in the freezer.

84
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:32,741
How often do you read it?

85
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:35,811
Haven't you ever read the same book
over and over again?

86
00:05:36,781 --> 00:05:38,476
l read Little Women more than once.

87
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,050
That's a classic. What's so great
about The Shining?

88
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:44,882
The question should be, Rach, what is
not so great about The Shining?

89
00:05:46,658 --> 00:05:49,889
And the answer would be,
nothing. All right?

90
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:54,828
This is the scariest book ever. l bet it's
way better than that classic of yours.

91
00:05:57,269 --> 00:05:59,260
We'll just see about that, okay?

92
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:05,271
l will read The Shining,
and you will read Little Women.

93
00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:07,274
-All right, you got it.
-All right.

94
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:10,942
Now, Rach, these little women.

95
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:14,245
How little are they?

96
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,386
l mean, are they, like, scary little?

97
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:26,355
You know, l love this fabric.

98
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:30,834
l think l'm gonna have a suit
made out of this.

99
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:35,762
Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.

100
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:37,101
-Hey.
-Hi.

101
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:39,641
You have lipstick right here.

102
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:42,503
That's okay. lt's mine.
We just kissed.

103
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:45,943
So isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?

104
00:06:46,217 --> 00:06:48,583
Well, l'm from California.

105
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:52,253
Right, right. Sometimes you guys
just burst into flame.

106
00:07:02,934 --> 00:07:06,392
l'm up. l'm up. l've gotten up now.

107
00:07:06,571 --> 00:07:08,471
Anybody want anything?

108
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,868
-l'll have coffee.
-Me too.

109
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,030
Make that three.

110
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:13,973
Okay, Ross, why don't you come
with me?

111
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,978
What is the matter with you?
What's going on?

112
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:22,983
Robert's coming out.

113
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:25,417
What do you mean?
What? ls he gay?

114
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:33,757
He's coming out of his shorts.

115
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:37,901
What?

116
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:40,801
The man is showing brain.

117
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:48,477
Are you sure? Hold on.

118
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:51,676
l'm sorry, you guys.
That was a coffee and a....

119
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,340
Coffee. We could write it down.

120
00:07:53,618 --> 00:07:56,883
No, no, that won't be necessary.

121
00:08:03,461 --> 00:08:06,760
-Well?
-Yeah.

122
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:10,025
-What do we do? What do we do?
-Well, l suppose we just...

123
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:14,069
...try to not look directly at it.

124
00:08:15,273 --> 00:08:17,298
Like an eclipse.

125
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:24,314
When people compliment me on my
cooking tonight, what do l say?

126
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:28,282
You say, ''Thank you very much.''
And then you buy me something pretty.

127
00:08:28,553 --> 00:08:31,113
Come on, we're gonna
put our hands in this bowl...

128
00:08:31,356 --> 00:08:34,189
...and we're gonna start
squishing the tomatoes.

129
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:38,357
This feels very weird.

130
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:41,462
You touch people's eyeballs,
and this feels weird?

131
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:46,693
Sure, l touch them, but l spent years
learning not to squish them.

132
00:08:52,477 --> 00:08:54,206
That's my hand.

133
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,908
-Gotta keep squishing.
-The tomatoes are squishing.

134
00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:05,088
You got some on your shirt.

135
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:06,917
Hold on one second.

136
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:11,421
Just put a little club soda on it.
Get to it right away.

137
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:14,588
lt should do...

138
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,428
...the trick.

139
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:28,639
What?

140
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:30,178
You've got some on your pants.

141
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:35,709
l'll just throw them out.

142
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:43,885
These little women!

143
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:48,187
You're liking it?

144
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:51,858
Oh, yeah.
Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.

145
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:54,197
l don't see how he could forgive her.

146
00:09:57,342 --> 00:10:00,436
Jo's a girl.
lt's short for Josephine.

147
00:10:01,112 --> 00:10:03,706
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.

148
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,281
You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?

149
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:14,321
Because that is the one thing missing
from The Shining.

150
00:10:17,295 --> 00:10:19,388
No, actually, Laurie's a boy.

151
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:23,895
No wonder Rachel had to read this
so many times.

152
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:27,660
-Hey.
-Hey.

153
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,670
How'd the basketball go?

154
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:34,835
l learned how to shoot a lay-up,
a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.

155
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:36,472
You mean a 3-pointer?

156
00:10:36,681 --> 00:10:39,172
l get more because l'm dainty.

157
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:43,246
So is there a phone here
l check my messages?

158
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:45,353
Yeah, in the back.
Do you want a quarter?

159
00:10:45,523 --> 00:10:48,890
No, thanks. l always carry one
in my sock.

160
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:02,730
What are you doing?
Get back over on your side of the--

161
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:05,102
Hello!

162
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,110
Hi, l'm Joey. We haven't met.

163
00:11:11,282 --> 00:11:13,182
Good to meet you. Robert.

164
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:18,215
What?

165
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,287
What? You guys, what is going on?

166
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,156
Do you not like Robert?

167
00:11:25,396 --> 00:11:26,727
Why are you laughing?

168
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:28,923
Calm down.
There's no reason to get testy.

169
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:37,230
-You guys! Come on!
-We're sorry.

170
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:43,210
We're sorry. lt just seems that Robert
isn't as concealed in the shorts area...

171
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:44,848
...as one may have hoped.

172
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,412
What do you mean?

173
00:11:47,585 --> 00:11:50,486
-Hey.
-Hey.

174
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:55,422
Robert, could you pass me
those cookies?

175
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:57,656
Sure.

176
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:05,061
-Ball?
-Yeah.

177
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:11,666
So how'd the lasagna go over?

178
00:12:12,343 --> 00:12:16,336
Really? Good. So you owe me
three pretty things.

179
00:12:17,515 --> 00:12:20,279
Yeah, l've been thinking a lot
about you too.

180
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:24,849
Well, no. lt's hard, this platonomy thing.

181
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:27,822
lt's a word.

182
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:33,292
Yeah, l do think it's better this way.

183
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:35,091
Yeah, we're being smart.

184
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:37,357
Yes, l'm sure.

185
00:12:39,537 --> 00:12:41,528
You really sure?

186
00:12:42,974 --> 00:12:44,805
l'll call you back.

187
00:12:55,753 --> 00:12:58,119
So we can be friends
who sleep together.

188
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,059
Absolutely. This'll just be
something we do.

189
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,956
Like racquetball.

190
00:13:05,963 --> 00:13:08,193
Sounds smart and healthy to me.

191
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:13,628
So just out of curiosity...

192
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:17,397
...do you currently have
any other racquetball buddies?

193
00:13:18,476 --> 00:13:20,637
Just your dad.

194
00:13:22,313 --> 00:13:24,873
Although that's actually racquetball.

195
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:28,610
You know, l do have a blind date...

196
00:13:28,786 --> 00:13:31,949
...with my sister's neighbor
next Tuesday.

197
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:36,726
Do you want me to cancel it?

198
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:38,719
No!

199
00:13:39,997 --> 00:13:45,629
No, because if you did,
that means you'd be canceling for me.

200
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:49,995
-And we're just friends.
-Exactly.

201
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:53,043
And besides, it wouldn't be
fair anyway...

202
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:56,578
...because my mother's trying to
set me up with some lawyer.

203
00:13:57,115 --> 00:13:58,207
So who's this lawyer?

204
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:01,910
No, she doesn't actually have one,
but she's looking.

205
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:05,878
Hey.

206
00:14:06,057 --> 00:14:07,854
Hey. Don't sit down!

207
00:14:08,025 --> 00:14:12,394
-Ready to go to the batting cage?
-Yeah, you bet. And first, here's a gift.

208
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:18,895
Stretchy pants?

209
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,038
Those are the greatest things
in the world!

210
00:14:21,205 --> 00:14:23,799
lf l were you, l'd wear them
every day, every day!

211
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,076
Jeez, thank you.
Really, that's so nice.

212
00:14:28,246 --> 00:14:32,649
But, to be honest,
l don't think l can wear these.

213
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:36,082
They're so tight.
l'd feel like l'm on display.

214
00:14:38,122 --> 00:14:39,316
l'm sorry.

215
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,220
That's all right. l'll figure....

216
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:46,761
Hey.

217
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:48,865
-How's it going?
-Good.

218
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:51,194
Hey, Rach, how you doing
with The Shining?

219
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:53,936
Danny just went into room 21 7.

220
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:57,801
The next part's the best!
When that dead lady in the bathtub--

221
00:14:57,975 --> 00:15:00,409
No! Come on, you're gonna ruin it!

222
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:02,838
All right, l'll talk in code.

223
00:15:03,014 --> 00:15:06,472
Remember when the kid sees
those two blanks in the hallway?

224
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:09,079
Yeah, that's very cool.

225
00:15:09,787 --> 00:15:13,780
All blank and no blank makes
blank a blank-blank.

226
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:19,522
No, the end! When Jack almost kills
them all with that blank...

227
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:21,597
...but in the last second they get away.

228
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:25,860
Joey, l can't believe you just did that.

229
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:28,904
l can't believe she cracked your code.

230
00:15:33,744 --> 00:15:37,271
All right. Okay. Laurie proposes
to Jo, and she says no...

231
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:42,144
...even though she's still in love with
him. And then he ends up marrying Amy.

232
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:47,322
Hey, mine was by accident!

233
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:52,394
All right. The boiler explodes and
destroys the hotel and kills the dad.

234
00:15:54,832 --> 00:15:57,027
Beth dies.

235
00:16:04,575 --> 00:16:07,066
Beth-- Beth dies?

236
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:12,313
ls that true?
lf l keep reading, is Beth gonna die?

237
00:16:12,683 --> 00:16:15,914
No, Beth doesn't die.
She doesn't die. Does she, Rachel?

238
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,315
-What?
-Joey's asking if you've ruined...

239
00:16:18,523 --> 00:16:21,959
...the first book he's ever loved
that didn't star Jack Nicholson.

240
00:16:25,763 --> 00:16:28,755
No. She doesn't die.

241
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,831
Then why would you say that?

242
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:38,865
Because l wanted to hurt you.

243
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:43,140
There they are.
l dropped my keys.

244
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,315
Got them.

245
00:16:52,456 --> 00:16:53,582
Hi.

246
00:16:54,325 --> 00:16:56,555
Sorry. l'm sorry.

247
00:16:56,827 --> 00:16:58,886
You would not believe my day.

248
00:16:59,297 --> 00:17:02,858
l had to work two shifts.
And then to top it off...

249
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:07,298
...l lost one of my fake boobs
in a grill fire.

250
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:12,165
What are you smiling at?

251
00:17:12,343 --> 00:17:14,641
l was just thinking your day
could still pick up.

252
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:22,342
Hello.

253
00:17:23,054 --> 00:17:24,988
l love this friend thing!

254
00:17:31,996 --> 00:17:36,194
Robert's gonna be here any second,
so could one of you just tell him?

255
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,893
Please, right now.

256
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:42,062
Every time l see him, it's like,
''ls it on the loose? ls it watching me?''

257
00:17:43,841 --> 00:17:44,830
We can't tell him.

258
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:50,572
You can't go up to a guy you barely
know and talk about his stuff.

259
00:17:50,748 --> 00:17:55,014
He's right. Even if it's
to say something complimentary.

260
00:17:57,989 --> 00:18:00,924
Why don't you just tell him?
You're going out with him.

261
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:06,029
Way too awkward. No. l haven't
even seen it with permission yet.

262
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:09,532
So, what do l do?
Just break up with him?

263
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,158
l don't know. l think this is
an unsolvable problem.

264
00:18:13,404 --> 00:18:15,463
lt's a curiette mariah.

265
00:18:17,141 --> 00:18:19,109
Captain Kirk's unsolvable problem...

266
00:18:19,276 --> 00:18:22,211
...as part of his training to be
a Star Fleet commander.

267
00:18:22,613 --> 00:18:24,103
Kobayashi Maru.

268
00:18:24,915 --> 00:18:26,075
What's a curiette mariah?

269
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,686
lt's the place with the cheap rooms
where we stayed in lsrael.

270
00:18:30,554 --> 00:18:32,146
-Hey.
-Hey.

271
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:33,483
So you ready for the gym?

272
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:37,791
They got this new rock-climbing wall.
We can spot each other.

273
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:41,164
Yeah, l can spot you from here.

274
00:18:44,301 --> 00:18:45,290
What?

275
00:18:46,737 --> 00:18:49,171
Okay, listen, Robert--

276
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:52,872
-Hey, don't we have to--?
-Yeah, we got....

277
00:19:00,017 --> 00:19:05,114
-l think you're really, really great.
-Oh, God. Here we go again.

278
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:09,826
Why does this keep happening to me?
ls it something l'm putting out there?

279
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:15,692
ls this my fault? Or am l just nuts?

280
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:21,337
l don't know what to say.

281
00:19:22,406 --> 00:19:27,366
Hey, buddy? This is a family place.
Put the mouse back in the house.

282
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:55,002
Really? lt's just like
everyone else's apartment.

283
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:57,037
lt's got rooms and walls
and ceilings.

284
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,676
l just wanted to see where you live.
Give me the tour.

285
00:19:59,844 --> 00:20:02,244
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

286
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:04,946
-This is the living room.
-That's nice.

287
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:07,275
And this is the kitchen.

288
00:20:07,451 --> 00:20:10,750
That's real pretty. Wait a minute.
Don't l get to see the bedroom?

289
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:15,017
The bedroom. Well, it's pretty much
your typical...

290
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:18,354
...bedroom.

291
00:20:18,729 --> 00:20:22,529
We're still on this side of the door.
But l didn't get to see it.

292
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:25,531
Oh, shoot. Maybe next time.

293
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:27,432
Thanks for a lovely evening.

294
00:20:45,322 --> 00:20:47,119
So who is she?

295
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,859
That was the blind date
that l told you about.

296
00:20:51,028 --> 00:20:54,225
She called and switched it
from Tuesday.

297
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:57,431
Did you like her?

298
00:20:57,635 --> 00:21:02,902
l'm just asking as a friend
because l am totally fine with this.

299
00:21:04,942 --> 00:21:06,739
Well, you seem fine.

300
00:21:07,478 --> 00:21:10,572
Okay, you know what?
l'm not fine. l'm not.

301
00:21:10,815 --> 00:21:14,546
l mean, how could l be fine?
Hearing you come in with her.

302
00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:17,777
She wants to see your bedroom.

303
00:21:24,628 --> 00:21:26,687
You know what?

304
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:30,592
What if we're friends...

305
00:21:31,435 --> 00:21:33,369
...who don't see other people?

306
00:21:36,006 --> 00:21:37,974
You mean like exclusive friends?

307
00:21:38,142 --> 00:21:39,473
Why not?

308
00:21:40,377 --> 00:21:43,869
l mean, this has been
the most amazing week.

309
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:47,079
Would it be so terrible?

310
00:21:47,985 --> 00:21:52,046
Even if we were friends
who lived together?

311
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:58,887
Or maybe someday, friends who stood
up in front of their other friends...

312
00:21:59,129 --> 00:22:02,690
...and vowed to be friends forever.

313
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:10,936
You know, we're back where we were.

314
00:22:12,676 --> 00:22:17,807
Honey, l would love to do all that,
but nothing's changed.

315
00:22:18,148 --> 00:22:21,845
That's not true.
You don't have a mustache.

316
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,480
Okay, one thing's changed.

317
00:22:26,924 --> 00:22:30,485
But we still want different things,
and we know how this is gonna end.

318
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:33,096
You know what?

319
00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:36,430
l gotta walk out of here right now...

320
00:22:37,768 --> 00:22:41,636
...because getting over you is the
hardest thing l have ever had to do.

321
00:22:43,607 --> 00:22:45,666
l don't think l could do it again.

322
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,135
l know l couldn't.

323
00:22:50,314 --> 00:22:52,248
Yeah.

324
00:22:54,351 --> 00:22:56,285
So....

325
00:23:04,028 --> 00:23:06,997
How about one last
game of racquetball?

326
00:23:12,503 --> 00:23:14,562
Watch the thorns!

327
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:23,140
What?

328
00:23:24,548 --> 00:23:26,072
Beth is really, really sick.

329
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:35,718
Jo's there, but l don't think
there's anything she can do.

330
00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:40,528
-Joey?
-Yeah.

331
00:23:40,698 --> 00:23:43,258
You wanna put the book
in the freezer?

332
00:23:47,104 --> 00:23:48,093
