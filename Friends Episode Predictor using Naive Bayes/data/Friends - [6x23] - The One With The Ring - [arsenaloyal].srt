1
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:05,135
Can you help me pick
an engagement ring?

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:10,433
I can't figure this out. Should I get her a
Tiffany cut or a princess cut or a..?

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,979
Paper cut!

4
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:18,407
-Have you told anyone else?
-No, I don't want Monica to find out.

5
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:19,710
You told me.

6
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,285
Because I trust you
and we're friends...

7
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,356
and you saw me looking
at ring brochures.

8
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,791
Once again, not knocking pays off.

9
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,723
-I wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
-Me too.

10
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,534
Let me see. Is there such a thing
as a Monica cut?

11
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,001
Because that would be you best bet.

12
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:45,399
-Want to go to the coffeehouse?
-Oh, all right.

13
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,111
We were just gonna see
if you wanted to go.

14
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,749
Well, we don't because
we got the other place.

15
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,952
How rude.

16
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,887
Sorry. Want a bite?

17
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,453
The One With The Ring

18
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,426
So how are things going with Paul?

19
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,692
Good.

20
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,460
Although, you know,
he's a private guy.

21
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,835
I wish I could get him to open up,
share some feelings.

22
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:53,671
You just have to think of him
as a jar of pickles that won't open.

23
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,608
I should run him under hot water
and bang his head against a table?

24
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,478
That's what you do when you want
to get the truth out of someone.

25
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,495
-Watch this.
-Okay.

26
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,255
-Hey, Paul.
-Hi, Phoebe.

27
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,262
How are things going with you?

28
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,664
Can't complain.

29
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,069
-Hey!
-Hi.

30
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,144
-Great to..
-Ross, good to see you too.

31
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,940
You take care.

32
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,847
What was the deal with you
and Chandler blowing us off before?

33
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,856
That was so weird, huh?

34
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,589
Why did you do it?

35
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,265
I didn't do it. It was Chandler.

36
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,759
He's mad at you.

37
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,931
-What? Why?
-Oh, please. I think you know why.

38
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,534
I can't think of anything.

39
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:01,406
Come on. You're a paleontologist.
Dig a little deeper.

40
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:08,483
Is it because Joey and I didn't
invite him to that Knicks game?

41
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:12,050
Is that something
he'd be mad at you for?

42
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,990
-I guess it could.
-Well, then I think that's it.

43
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,333
If he's angry, he shouldn't hide it.
I wish he'd just tell me the truth.

44
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:26,629
You should run him under hot water
and bang his head against the table.

45
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,610
Honey, I made a reservation
at China Garden. Is that okay?

46
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,142
Yeah, that's great.

47
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:38,510
But first, talk to me.
Talk to me. Tell me about your day.

48
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,719
It was fine.

49
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,344
Okay.

50
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,791
What are you thinking right now?

51
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:51,622
That you are looking
really fine in that dress.

52
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,994
Yeah, that's great, Paul.
But, you know....

53
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,836
I want to know what..
Wow, those are really great!

54
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,173
I just want to know...

55
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:07,539
what is behind this strong,
silent exterior?

56
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:12,649
They say that still waters run deep,
and I want to swim in yours.

57
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,447
Are you talking about having sex?

58
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,624
No, Paul.

59
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:24,525
I don't know anything about you.
Tell me about your childhood.

60
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,025
Normal.

61
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:30,825
Then how about puberty? Come on!
That's always a painful time.

62
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,836
Your friends have a slumber party
and stick your hand in warm water...

63
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,907
while you sleep, so you pee
in your sleeping bag.

64
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,011
No, that never happened to me.

65
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:46,278
You're lucky you never
met that bitch, Sharon Majeski.

66
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,276
Anyway...

67
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,086
The rest of your life. Any regrets?

68
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,219
Nope.

69
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,153
I'm not asking for a lot here.

70
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,491
Just give me something. Anything.

71
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,399
-Okay.
-Okay.

72
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:10,073
When I was 6 years old,
I wanted a Big Wheel.

73
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,207
And instead, my parents
got me this little...

74
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:17,542
plastic chicken
that you hop around on.

75
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,049
It was embarrassing.
Kids made fun of me.

76
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,049
That was a tough year.

77
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,721
That's great! See?

78
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,257
I already feel like I know you
a little better.

79
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,192
Okay, come on.
Now we can go eat. Let's go!

80
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,093
It was horrible.

81
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,567
They called me "Chicken Boy."

82
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,410
In fifth grade, I got in a fight.
Well, not really.

83
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,347
Richard Danville bit me.

84
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:58,114
I still have a little scar right here.
You can see it.

85
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,552
Yeah, yeah. I see the scar.

86
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,754
I think this is really great that,
you know, you've shared your feelings.

87
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,863
It's really...
It's beautiful.

88
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,400
But what do you say we
go share some food?

89
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,264
No, I couldn't eat now.

90
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:17,272
What are you talking about?
You love their Kung Pao chicken!

91
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:19,935
Chicken?

92
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,016
-Chicken Boy!
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

93
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:38,759
This is the nine millionth ring store,
and I can't find the perfect ring.

94
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,399
Ugly ring, ugly ring, ugly ring...

95
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,262
It's a beautiful selection.

96
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:53,703
So maybe you don't get her a ring.
Maybe you do something different.

97
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,177
An engagement bracelet
or an engagement tiara!

98
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:02,284
An engagement Revolutionary War musket!

99
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,650
I'm so glad I picked you
to help me with this.

100
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,860
Imagine getting down on one knee...

101
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:12,427
and handing her this gorgeous
piece of weaponry?

102
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,364
I'll stick with the ring.

103
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,765
This one's nice. I like it. Sir?

104
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,499
Kind sir, can I see this one?

105
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,506
This is why you brought me.
I know how to haggle.

106
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:30,079
-Let me handle this from here.
-Can I help you?

107
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,716
-I would like to see that ring.
-Or not. Whatever.

108
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,883
This ring is from the 1920s.

109
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,455
It's a one and a half carat diamond
with sapphires.

110
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,320
Sir, could I ask you...?

111
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:46,760
Could you hold out that ring
and ask me to marry you?

112
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,229
-Okay.
-Okay.

113
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,503
Will you marry me?

114
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,905
Oh, my God, that's it!
That's the ring!

115
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,742
-How much is it?
-I will handle this.

116
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,740
How much is it?

117
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,007
$8600.

118
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,549
We will give you $10.

119
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,417
-Are you interested in this ring?
-Yes.

120
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,716
But I can only pay $8000.

121
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:18,356
-Okay. I can let it go for 8.
-We stand firm at $10.

122
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,363
-How would you like to pay?
-Credit card.

123
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,126
Oh, no! I lent my credit card
to Joey.

124
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,530
I'll go get it.
You guard the ring.

125
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:30,105
-Why did you give your credit card to Joey?
-To buy some Knicks tickets.

126
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:34,042
Then the jerk didn't even invite me
to the game. But I'm over it. Whatever!

127
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,716
Listen, I'm sorry about before.

128
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,318
Do you have anything here for $10?

129
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:45,648
Yes. I have these two
rather beautiful...

130
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,326
five-dollar bills.

131
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,693
I'll give you $1 for them.

132
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,498
Remember how Chandler
and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?

133
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,032
No.

134
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,799
-Remember, you were eating pizza?
-Yeah.

135
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:11,209
Chandler's angry at us for not getting
him a ticket to that Knicks game.

136
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:16,714
We were supposed to just get him one?
That guy's always mooching off of us.

137
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,327
Anyway, I still think we should
try to patch things up.

138
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,725
We could get tickets to another
game and invite him.

139
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:30,025
That's a great idea.
And I still have his credit card.

140
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,595
Here you go.

141
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,899
Hey, hey. I got this one.
Here you go.

142
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,570
Sometimes I just don't get Chandler.

143
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:43,372
We do stuff all the time without you,
and you don't get all upset.

144
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,386
-All the time?
-All the time.

145
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,019
I'm sorry, it was rejected.

146
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,853
That's impossible. Let me see that.

147
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,819
This one's mine. Here you go.

148
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,230
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

149
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,327
-Still crying?
-Like a little girl.

150
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,699
I know, I know. This is all my fault.

151
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,705
I wanted him to open up.

152
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,504
I didn't know that
I was gonna unleash...

153
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:18,740
this weepy, clingy,
moist monster!

154
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:23,686
I only know of two ways to shut
a man up. One of them is sex.

155
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,248
-What's the other?
-Don't know. Never had to use it.

156
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:32,023
I'm just saying, if we're having sex,
he's not talking.

157
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,459
That's right. You're the talker.

158
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,929
Anyway, great idea.

159
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,397
I gotta buy him some more tissues.

160
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,871
-We have some here.
-No, you don't!

161
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:53,184
Okay. I'd also like
to try on the tiara.

162
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,745
Oh, yeah. Okay.

163
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,092
What do you think? Too much?

164
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,418
A tad.

165
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,195
Take the tiara back...

166
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,101
and let me hold the musket again.

167
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,302
Something's missing.

168
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,781
Let me see the ring that
my friend picked out.

169
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:30,651
-Where's the 1920s princess-cut ring?
-I just sold it to that gentleman.

170
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,584
Oh, my God!

171
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,452
Wait, no!

172
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,126
Let me out! Now!

173
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:54,840
Rachel?

174
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,407
No.

175
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,179
-How are you, Paul?
-Okay.

176
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,421
Chandler...

177
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,560
-did your dad ever hug you?
-No. Did he hug you?

178
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,590
No! No.

179
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,995
It's just that my dad never did.

180
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:20,896
I miss my dad.

181
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,367
You can see my dad in Vegas
kissing other dads.

182
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,875
-Hey, Chandler?
-Yeah?

183
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,617
Would you...?

184
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,018
Would you hug me?

185
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:45,888
-I'm a little busy here, Paul.
-That's what my dad used to say.

186
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,465
Okay. A quick one.
Come on, hug it out.

187
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,003
There you go.

188
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,698
Okay.

189
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,201
-Five more seconds..
-Okay!

190
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,378
-Joey!
-What? Hey, what..?

191
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,211
Hi. Paul, is it?

192
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,119
-Do you have my credit card?
-Yeah. It's in my...

193
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,985
In my pocket.

194
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,425
-My back pocket!
-Thank God.

195
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,634
-I got tickets to the Knicks tonight.
-I can't go.

196
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,996
It'll be fun.

197
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:30,732
Me, you, Ross and
Paul, probably.

198
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,040
Look, I don't have time for this, okay?
I gotta go.

199
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,848
That was mean.

200
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,813
Yeah, I know.

201
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,022
-Get in here.
-Yeah.

202
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,630
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.

203
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,698
I'm gonna go with
the one I picked first.

204
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,703
Oh, wake up. The one
you picked is gone. It's over!

205
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,430
What?

206
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:08,139
Some guy bought it. I tried to stop
him, but they put me in jail!

207
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:13,316
-They put you in jail?
-The little jail between the doors!

208
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,782
-I asked you to guard the ring!
-I know. I'm sorry.

209
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:20,956
But this ring is better. And Monica
never saw the other ring.

210
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:25,687
Yeah, but when he proposed to me
with the ring, I got goosebumps.

211
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,898
-Maybe it was the guy.
-It was the ring!

212
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,763
-Was he excited about the tickets?
-No! He blew us off!

213
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,032
-What?
-I know.

214
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,107
I can't believe it.

215
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,410
Can I tell you something?

216
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,107
I'm a little mad at him now!

217
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,450
Can I tell you something?

218
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,579
Me too!

219
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,860
He didn't want to talk to us
about being angry.

220
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,587
Maybe we don't talk to him at all!

221
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,800
-Freeze him out.
-Right!

222
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,502
-I like it.
-We'll show him.

223
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:09,764
From now on, it's gonna be
Joey and Ross, best friends.

224
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,941
We'll be the new Joey and Chandler.

225
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,273
What?

226
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:21,377
You think you and Chandler
were closer than me and Chandler?

227
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,578
Hey, don't get angry.

228
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,782
We turn on each other, he wins.

229
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,965
Hi, I'm back.

230
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,124
I've written down more to tell you!

231
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,199
Oh, that's great.

232
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,567
No, actually, that's...

233
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,368
That's great. That's really great.

234
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:50,014
You know, I gotta tell you, writing,
all that writing, it gets me...

235
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,047
It gets me kind of hot.

236
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,719
Wait, wait. Listen to this:

237
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,452
Know what I wanted to be at that age?

238
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,119
A lover?

239
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,591
-A surfer.
-A surfer?

240
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,428
-I wanted to be one with the waves..
-Hold on.

241
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:12,069
Let me just get
a little more comfortable here.

242
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,328
Wait a second.

243
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,665
-This isn't too revealing, is it?
-No.

244
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,445
Whatever happened to that little dude?

245
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,239
So full of dreams.

246
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:29,080
I don't care about the little dude!

247
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,547
I can't! I cannot listen
to any more of this!

248
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,158
The only one who'd listen
is a mental health professional!

249
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,692
That's only because
they get $100 an hour!

250
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:42,957
Do you know how much money I could
have made listening to you? $2000!

251
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,171
Know when I figured that out?
While you were talking!

252
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:51,269
I can't believe you're trying
to stifle me when 14 hours ago...

253
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,002
we figured out that's what
my mother was trying to do!

254
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,849
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,814
I don't mean...
I didn't mean to stifle you.

256
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:05,357
This is all just
a little overwhelming.

257
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,726
I'm so sorry.

258
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,324
I didn't mean to overwhelm you.

259
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,396
It's just that
when those gates open...

260
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,532
it's hard to close them.

261
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,539
But they are closed now. Believe me.

262
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,507
I'm so glad. I'm so glad you shared.

263
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,642
And I'm glad that you're done.

264
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,417
So what do you say we....

265
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:39,885
I'd like that.

266
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:55,195
That was so good!

267
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,040
Oh, oh.

268
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:13,521
I can't believe you talked me into
this gumball-machine-looking ring.

269
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,521
It's not a gumball-machine-looking ring.
It's a beautiful ring!

270
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,219
No, it's not.

271
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:23,060
When I looked at the other ring,
I could see Monica's face...

272
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,102
and I could see her saying yes.
Looking at this, I only see a ring.

273
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:31,709
Unless I look at it really closely,
and then I can see my own eye.

274
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:41,476
This is the most important thing I'll
ever do. I want to make it perfect.

275
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,250
Maybe we could get
the other ring back.

276
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,221
I heard where
the guy was gonna propose.

277
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,226
-Maybe we could get him to trade rings.
-I can't do that.

278
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,923
You certainly can't give her
that stupid gumball ring.

279
00:18:56,135 --> 00:19:00,128
-All right. Where was he going?
-Yeah, it's a restaurant...

280
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,599
-The Rainbow something.
-Rainbow Room?

281
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,164
Rainbow Grill?

282
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,334
Somewhere Over the...?

283
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,440
-L'Espace.
-Rainbow L'Espace!

284
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,606
No, just L'Espace.

285
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:16,551
I'd love to know how you got
from rainbow to L'Espace.

286
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,451
No, you wouldn't.

287
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,816
You don't wanna get in here.

288
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,200
There he is.

289
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,168
He hasn't proposed yet.
She has no ring on.

290
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:38,307
Wow, you're good!
After this, we should solve crimes.

291
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,803
Okay. Go get him.

292
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,571
Oh, okay.

293
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,183
Excuse me. Could you
come with me? You have a phone call.

294
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,922
-Who is it?
-It's your office.

295
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,554
-Do you know who at my office?
-John.

296
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,783
Oh, John! Great!

297
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,429
-There he is.
-Hi. Okay.

298
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,633
There was a mix-up at the store.

299
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:06,200
The ring you have was supposed
to be held for me.

300
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,599
I'm gonna need to have that back.

301
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:15,376
In exchange, I'm willing to trade you
this beautiful, more expensive ring.

302
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,413
Wow, I would trade.

303
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:24,411
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use
this one. Excuse me.

304
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:28,023
This is my fiancee,
and her heart was set on that ring.

305
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,955
Do you want to break her heart?

306
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,659
Yeah. Do you want to break
a dying woman's heart?

307
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,033
You're dying?

308
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,129
Yeah, she's dying...

309
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,567
of a cough, apparently.

310
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:49,574
It's my dying wish to have that ring.
If I'm not buried with it...

311
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,909
my spirit will wander
the netherworld..

312
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,278
That's enough!

313
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,649
Oh, I don't know.

314
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,489
-Let me see it.
-Great. Okay, here.

315
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,558
-All right, I'll do it.
-Thank you.

316
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,962
And you are about to marry
a wonderful man.

317
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,170
Hey, I'm marrying a dead woman!

318
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,008
Guys?

319
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,456
I've got something important
to tell you.

320
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,454
Guys?

321
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,155
Guys?

322
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,830
Guys?

323
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,999
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.

324
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,806
I think we gotta end the freeze-out.

325
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,974
Wait. Is this for real?

326
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,042
Yeah. Check out the ring.

327
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,974
Oh, my God!

328
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,310
So you two are really serious?

329
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,052
Yeah, pretty much.

330
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,385
You're gonna get married?

331
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:12,158
We're gonna be brothers-in-law!
Come here!

332
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,196
And we're gonna be friends again.

333
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:19,665
What?

334
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,772
-Water under the bridge! Forget it!
-Okay.

335
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:27,169
I was gonna wait till it was official,
but I had to tell you guys.

336
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,175
You're my best friends.

337
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,838
-I can't believe this.
-Me too.

338
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:35,510
I was planning on having a conversation
with you about your intentions.

339
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,522
I think I'm gonna cry.

340
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,920
Oh! No more crying!

341
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,128
I just dumped one crybaby.
I'll dump you too.

342
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,598
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.

343
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,695
Oh, my God!

344
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,596
Oh, my God!

345
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:56,035
Oh, Chandler!
You guys are gonna be so happy!

346
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:59,436
-I know.
-Where's all the tissues?!

347
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:06,851
-Check out the ring.
-Oh, nice. One and a half carat, easy.

348
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:09,813
-Hey.
-Hey, Phoebe.

349
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:13,717
-He's gonna ask Monica to marry him.
-I helped pick out the ring.

350
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:20,129
You told her before you told us?

351
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:25,732
She walked in while I was looking at
brochures. You can understand that.

352
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,839
Guys?

353
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,975
Guys?

354
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:43,682
God, that ring Chandler picked out
was so beautiful.

355
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,790
You should know.
You've bought like a billion of them.

356
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,989
Humor based on my pain.

357
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,723
You know what's funny?

358
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:59,200
Of all of your wives,
I'm the only one who never got a ring.

359
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,771
This a big issue for you?

360
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,804
No, but it would have been nice
to have a little memento...

361
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,639
of our married time together.

362
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,908
Something other than the divorce papers
and the hangover.

363
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,144
Ross is obviously
not gonna get you a ring.

364
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:19,347
But ask for a musket.
Ask for a musket!

365
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,753
When we were married,
do you know what I never got?

366
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,055
Sex.

367
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,233
Well, yeah. No ring, no sex.
Big surprise.

368
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,928
Get me a musket and we'll talk.
