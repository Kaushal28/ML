1
00:00:01,713 --> 00:00:04,375
Hey, Chandler, why do you think
they call it foosball?

2
00:00:05,284 --> 00:00:07,548
- Know what I like about you, Joe?
- What?

3
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:09,550
You're curious.

4
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:11,786
- Hey.
- Hi.

5
00:00:11,957 --> 00:00:14,551
I'll drop Emma off at my mom's
if we're still on tonight.

6
00:00:14,726 --> 00:00:17,456
- Oh, you bet. Yeah.
- Okay.

7
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:19,859
- Say, "Bye."
- Bye.

8
00:00:20,032 --> 00:00:21,624
- Bye.
- Bye.

9
00:00:23,135 --> 00:00:25,763
- So you and Rachel tonight, huh?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:25,938 --> 00:00:28,168
Yeah, it's actually
our first official date.

11
00:00:28,373 --> 00:00:31,103
Wow, so tonight may be the night.
You nervous?

12
00:00:31,276 --> 00:00:35,042
No. This is the part
I'm actually good at.

13
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:39,843
What must it be like not to be
crippled by fear and self-loathing?

14
00:00:40,986 --> 00:00:42,681
It's okay.

15
00:00:43,722 --> 00:00:46,054
How can you be so confident?

16
00:00:46,224 --> 00:00:49,057
Well, I know exactly
what I'm gonna do.

17
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:53,493
- Really? Like, you have a routine?
- No. See, each woman is different.

18
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:56,498
You have to appreciate
their uniqueness.

19
00:00:56,902 --> 00:00:59,871
- Really?
- No, I do six things.

20
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:04,202
First, I look deep into her eyes,
then I kiss her.

21
00:01:04,376 --> 00:01:09,370
Next, I take my hand
and I softly graze her thigh.

22
00:01:09,548 --> 00:01:11,379
You mean like this?

23
00:01:16,054 --> 00:01:19,581
No, not like that. No, no.
No, like this:

24
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:25,590
I see what you mean.
That's quite nice.

25
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,895
- More foosball?
- And beer.

26
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,379
- Hey.
- Hey.

27
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:26,683
Hey, sweetie.

28
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:36,656
Hey, stop staring at my wife's legs.

29
00:02:36,835 --> 00:02:40,828
No, no. Stop staring
at your sister's legs.

30
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:44,466
I'm sorry, it's just--
How'd you get so tan?

31
00:02:44,643 --> 00:02:47,942
She went to one of those
spray-on tan places.

32
00:02:48,513 --> 00:02:50,538
That was supposed to be a secret.

33
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,177
Did I say spray-on tan places?

34
00:02:54,352 --> 00:02:56,684
I meant surf contest.

35
00:02:57,322 --> 00:02:59,051
Which she won.

36
00:03:00,726 --> 00:03:03,126
You got a spray-on tan?

37
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:05,695
Chandler gets pedicures!

38
00:03:05,997 --> 00:03:09,160
What? You do?
Like, with the toe separators?

39
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:12,165
Why? Why?

40
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:15,000
I can't believe that's sprayed on.

41
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:18,301
I mean, it looks really good.
I wonder if I should get one.

42
00:03:18,477 --> 00:03:22,880
Sure, then you should get a miniskirt
so you can really show it off.

43
00:03:23,048 --> 00:03:27,314
So do you get colors
or just French tips?

44
00:03:30,922 --> 00:03:34,824
- Here. Here's their card.
- Thanks.

45
00:03:34,993 --> 00:03:37,325
Hey, I know where this place is.

46
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:39,794
It used to be an X-rated video--

47
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:44,532
Florist.

48
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,368
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

49
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:53,534
You won't believe
who moved back to town.

50
00:03:53,712 --> 00:03:55,145
I know. Amanda.

51
00:03:55,313 --> 00:03:58,510
- She called me too. She's the worst.
- Who's Amanda?

52
00:03:58,683 --> 00:04:01,481
She's this girl who lived
in the building before you did.

53
00:04:01,653 --> 00:04:04,918
Then she moved to England and
picked up this fake British accent.

54
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,354
On the machine, this is her message:

55
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:11,656
"Monica, darling, it's Amanda calling."

56
00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:15,456
Are you trying to do a British accent?

57
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,861
Chandler gets pedicures.

58
00:04:22,407 --> 00:04:25,865
Just so I know, how many more
of those can I expect?

59
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:28,777
Know what Amanda said
when she called me?

60
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:31,541
"Oh, so sorry to catch you
on your mobile."

61
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:37,613
If you didn't wanna get me on my mobile,
then don't call me on my mobile.

62
00:04:38,256 --> 00:04:41,623
And she always brags about
all the famous people she's met.

63
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:43,260
Oh, I know!

64
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:46,295
"I slept with Billy Joel."

65
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:49,260
All right, who hasn't?

66
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:52,062
What are we gonna do?
I don't wanna see her.

67
00:04:52,237 --> 00:04:53,898
Let's just cut her out.

68
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:56,905
- What?
- Cut her out of our lives.

69
00:04:57,075 --> 00:05:00,533
Just ignore her calls
and dodge her till she gets the point.

70
00:05:00,712 --> 00:05:04,773
Well, I guess we could try that.
But it seems so harsh.

71
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,613
- Have you ever done that?
- No. Had it done to me, though.

72
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:11,052
Feels good.

73
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,791
All right, Mr. Geller, right this way.

74
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:24,228
So how dark do you wanna be?
We have one, two or three.

75
00:05:24,402 --> 00:05:26,734
Well, I like how you look.
What are you?

76
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:29,567
- Puerto Rican.
- Two. I think a two.

77
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,709
You'll face the red light.

78
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,713
When the light's on, the spraying's
about to start, so close your eyes.

79
00:05:37,883 --> 00:05:40,443
When the spraying stops,
count to five...

80
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:44,646
...pat yourself to avoid drip marks,
then turn to get your back. Got it?

81
00:05:44,823 --> 00:05:49,157
Spray, count, pat and turn.
Spray, count and pat.

82
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:53,957
- You catch on quick.
- Well, I have a Ph.D., so....

83
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:19,281
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three--

84
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:25,656
Wait, wait! I'm not--
I'm not finished counting!

85
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:32,367
You sprayed my front twice!

86
00:06:32,537 --> 00:06:35,802
- You never turned?
- No! I barely got to "three Mississippi"!

87
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:39,569
Mississippi? I said count to five.

88
00:06:40,378 --> 00:06:42,039
Mississippi-less-ly?

89
00:06:43,648 --> 00:06:45,513
Well, how bad is it?

90
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:49,017
Not that bad yet. But it gets
darker for the next four hours.

91
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:52,850
- So how dark will it get?
- You got sprayed with two twos and--

92
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:54,958
I'm a four?

93
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,059
Yeah, but your back's a zero.
You'll wanna even that out.

94
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,959
Really?

95
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:04,361
- You might wanna get back in there.
- Oh, okay!

96
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:16,244
Wait a minute,
there's no light on the back wall.

97
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:20,214
How do I know
when it's gonna start? Hello?

98
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:23,418
My eyes!

99
00:07:36,568 --> 00:07:38,832
The same thing happened again!

100
00:07:39,004 --> 00:07:41,871
- You got two more twos?
- I'm an eight!

101
00:07:47,512 --> 00:07:48,843
Thanks for dinner.

102
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:51,646
I thought you paid.

103
00:07:53,985 --> 00:07:56,852
Guess we won't be going back there.

104
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:00,249
- So....
- Yeah.

105
00:08:10,735 --> 00:08:14,535
Hey, what do you say we move this
onto the likes of the couch?

106
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:17,607
I say cheesy line, but okay.

107
00:08:37,695 --> 00:08:40,323
- What's the matter?
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

108
00:08:40,498 --> 00:08:43,433
- I don't know why I did that.
- Okay.

109
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:46,399
Okay. Sorry.

110
00:08:57,782 --> 00:09:01,309
I'm sorry. Again, I don't know
what happened. I must be nervous.

111
00:09:01,486 --> 00:09:03,681
I don't get it. Chandler loved it.

112
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:11,660
I promise. I won't do it again.
I really do. This is gonna be great.

113
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,821
- Okay.
- Okay.

114
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,906
Was that good for you?

115
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:39,421
No, don't get it.
Let the machine pick up.

116
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:43,049
Yeah, it could be Rachel asking
if someone could babysit again.

117
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:48,927
- It could be Amanda.
- Oh, you're right.

118
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,163
I was just kidding about Rachel.
Babysitting's a gas.

119
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,870
<i>Hello, Monica.</i>
<i>It's Amanda calling again.</i>

120
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:00,738
<i>I'm in the neighborhood,</i>
<i>hoping I could pop by your flat.</i>

121
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:05,076
You're from Yonkers!
Your last name is Buffamonteezi!

122
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:08,151
<i>Let's see.</i>
<i>So should you get this directly...</i>

123
00:10:08,353 --> 00:10:09,820
<i>...ring me back on my mobile.</i>

124
00:10:09,988 --> 00:10:12,115
Okay, don't hold thy breath.

125
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:18,893
- <i>Hello? Is someone on the line?</i>
- <i>Yes. I was looking for Monica.</i>

126
00:10:19,063 --> 00:10:22,123
Hang on, she's right here.

127
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:27,735
- Someone's on the phone for you.
- We weren't picking up. It's Amanda.

128
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:31,905
I get pedicures.

129
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,080
Hi, Amanda.

130
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:43,048
Actually, now is not a good time.

131
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:44,986
Dinner tomorrow night?

132
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:48,624
Okay, Phoebe and I will see you then.

133
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:51,284
Why? Why?
Why didn't you just say no?

134
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:55,159
Well, I said no to her coming over now.
I couldn't say no twice.

135
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,824
I got this uncontrollable need
to please people.

136
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,331
Fine. Fine. You would not
hold up well under torture.

137
00:11:03,508 --> 00:11:05,908
- Oh, and you would?
- I did.

138
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:12,512
- Rach, are you sure you wanna do this?
- Absolutely.

139
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:14,982
It's just a little weird.
It's you, and it's me.

140
00:11:15,153 --> 00:11:17,417
- It'll just take some getting used to.
- Okay.

141
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:20,820
Okay, well, how can
we make it easier?

142
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:24,989
Okay. Let's work from the top down.

143
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:33,831
- Just work the bra, Joe.
- Okay, got it, yeah. Absolutely.

144
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,174
- Okay.
- Okay.

145
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,150
- Is this thing welded shut?
- Okay.

146
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:57,024
- You want a little help?
- No.

147
00:11:57,195 --> 00:11:59,060
- Okay.
- I can handle it. Okay?

148
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,427
- I've been opening these since I was 9.
- Nine?

149
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,899
- What kind of 9-year-old girl wears a bra?
- No, no. I was 9.

150
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,698
See, she was 16. Okay? Yeah.

151
00:12:08,873 --> 00:12:12,832
My parents had-- I can't talk
and work at the same time!

152
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,243
All right, turn around.
I gotta get a look at this thing.

153
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:27,114
Sorry.

154
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:31,629
Well, this is romantic.

155
00:12:31,796 --> 00:12:34,526
I'm sorry. This has never
happened to me before.

156
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:37,634
I'm an expert at taking off bras.
I could do it with one hand.

157
00:12:37,802 --> 00:12:40,862
I could do it with my eyes closed.
Once I just looked at one...

158
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,234
...and it popped open.

159
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:47,671
- I blame your bra.
- It's a standard-issue bra clasp.

160
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:52,009
Then I blame you. Yeah. That's right.
You threw me off with all your slapping.

161
00:12:52,183 --> 00:12:56,279
Okay, look, I'm really sorry
about that, Joey.

162
00:12:56,487 --> 00:13:02,983
But do you think maybe, on some level,
you don't want to take off my bra?

163
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:07,628
No, I don't have another level.

164
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:25,939
Hi.

165
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:29,713
Oh, dear God.

166
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:32,651
Hold on. There's something different.

167
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:38,890
I went to that tanning place
your wife suggested.

168
00:13:39,063 --> 00:13:42,191
Was that place the sun?

169
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:45,701
Oh, and it gets worse.

170
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:54,207
Oh, my God, you can do a duet
of "Ebony and lvory" all by yourself.

171
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:58,538
How could you mess this up?
It's so easy.

172
00:13:58,716 --> 00:14:01,480
You go in the booth,
count to five and turn around.

173
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:03,984
- How do you count to five?
- One, two, three--

174
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:05,588
Damn it!

175
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:09,383
I know!

176
00:14:12,397 --> 00:14:15,423
What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?

177
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:18,361
How was your date with Joey?

178
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:23,098
Well, it was good,
until we got back to our apartment.

179
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:26,937
And then we were fooling around and
he started to put his hand up my leg...

180
00:14:27,111 --> 00:14:28,738
...and I kept slapping it away.

181
00:14:28,913 --> 00:14:30,312
You didn't like that?

182
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,083
Well, it wasn't just me, all right?
He freaked out too.

183
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:37,016
He couldn't even undo my bra.

184
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:40,624
Really? One time he just looked
at my bra and it popped open.

185
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:46,260
I do not know what's wrong with us.

186
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:48,763
We've kissed before
and that's been great.

187
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:51,033
But this time
it was leading somewhere...

188
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:54,694
...and I was very aware of the fact
that it was Joey touching me.

189
00:14:54,872 --> 00:14:56,772
You guys have been friends forever.

190
00:14:56,941 --> 00:14:59,501
The first time you kissed Ross
was weird.

191
00:14:59,677 --> 00:15:02,771
You couldn't stop laughing.
You got through that.

192
00:15:02,947 --> 00:15:06,348
Okay. That's true.
That's true, we can do this.

193
00:15:06,517 --> 00:15:09,850
You're right. We can do this.
We'll just power through.

194
00:15:10,021 --> 00:15:12,251
Chandler, can I talk to you
for a second?

195
00:15:12,423 --> 00:15:16,018
No need, problem solved.
We are powering through.

196
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:25,767
Chandler, stop.
It's not going to pop open.

197
00:15:25,937 --> 00:15:27,529
You don't know.

198
00:15:31,642 --> 00:15:33,200
- Hi, Phoebe.
- Hey.

199
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:35,641
- Is Amanda here yet?
- No.

200
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:39,749
I'm sorry for screwing up that "cutting
her out" plan, but I have a new plan.

201
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:43,045
Chandler will call in a few minutes
with an emergency.

202
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:46,384
Okay, what kind of emergency
gets us both out of here?

203
00:15:46,557 --> 00:15:50,220
What do you think of Mike and Chandler
being in a car accident?

204
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:53,559
- Are you kidding? I love it!
- Okay.

205
00:15:54,832 --> 00:15:57,323
- Hi.
- Hi.

206
00:15:58,002 --> 00:15:59,970
Hello!

207
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:03,332
It's so nice to see you.

208
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:07,535
Both of you, look at me.
Look how young I look!

209
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:12,142
Oh, gosh, we have
so much to catch up on.

210
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:17,686
But first things first. Touch my abs.
I don't exercise at all.

211
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:20,619
Oh, gosh. So, Monica, you're married.

212
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:25,057
- Yeah, his name is Chandler and he's--
- Oh, smell my neck.

213
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:30,596
It's not perfume. It's me.
It's my natural scent.

214
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,435
Musty.

215
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,571
Gosh, this is brilliant.
Gosh, it's just like old times.

216
00:16:39,744 --> 00:16:42,372
I'm so happy you two
are friends again.

217
00:16:43,014 --> 00:16:45,847
- When were we not friends?
- Well, it was 1992.

218
00:16:46,017 --> 00:16:50,818
And I remember, because that was
the year I had sex with Evel Knievel.

219
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,918
We were friends in 1992.

220
00:16:54,091 --> 00:16:57,254
No, I distinctly remember
you were dodging her calls...

221
00:16:57,428 --> 00:16:59,589
...and trying to avoid seeing her.

222
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:04,827
- You were going to cut me out?
- Well, kind of.

223
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:06,970
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, bugger.

224
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:12,667
Should I not have said that?
I feel like a perfect arse.

225
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:17,140
Well, in America, you're just an ass.

226
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,480
Hello?

227
00:17:23,654 --> 00:17:25,554
Chandler, what's wrong?

228
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:29,951
Oh, my God, are you all right?
Yeah, I'll be right there.

229
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:33,290
I'm so sorry, but Chandler
was in a car accident.

230
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:35,056
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

231
00:17:35,232 --> 00:17:38,030
- Was Mike with him?
- Nope.

232
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,631
- Got the champagne?
- Yes. Ready to power through.

233
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,745
Excellent. Put it on ice,
the phone is off the hook...

234
00:17:48,913 --> 00:17:52,747
...and, in the interest
of powering through....

235
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:03,458
Oh, sure. Now. Yeah.

236
00:18:03,628 --> 00:18:05,619
Okay, sexy...

237
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:10,165
...very sexy. Sexy.
All right, let's do it!

238
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:12,302
Okay, you're scaring me a little bit.

239
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:15,233
Get over it, soldier,
we gotta do this.

240
00:18:16,073 --> 00:18:19,099
- Okay. You like that, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

241
00:18:19,276 --> 00:18:23,542
You like that? Let's kick this
into high gear, huh?

242
00:18:24,415 --> 00:18:26,406
Yeah, baby!
I'll show you how we do it!

243
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:27,915
No, no, no!

244
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:29,848
You kneed me in my misters!

245
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:34,822
What? Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

246
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:37,820
Joey? Are you okay?

247
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,526
Soldier down.

248
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:50,499
We are not friends
with Phoebe anymore.

249
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:54,773
If she asks,
I protested a little, but okay.

250
00:18:56,013 --> 00:18:58,277
I just found out
that she tried cutting me out.

251
00:18:58,449 --> 00:19:01,282
Can you think of any reason
why someone would want to do that?

252
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:04,114
What is wrong with me,
Chandler? Tell me.

253
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:07,724
I had a very bad car accident.

254
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:12,762
Chandler, thank God you're alive.
Monica, can I talk to you outside?

255
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:18,630
- I have nothing to say to you.
- My flat is twice this size.

256
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:22,728
You know, they asked me
to be one of the Spice Girls.

257
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:28,437
Please, Monica, in the hall?

258
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:34,344
Oh, that accident
must have been terrible.

259
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:37,885
You look positively ghastly.

260
00:19:39,657 --> 00:19:42,217
Well, aren't you a treat.

261
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,518
I can't believe you tried to cut me out.
Why, Phoebe? Why?

262
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:48,995
It was right after we
were living together...

263
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,191
...and you were driving me crazy, okay?

264
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:54,997
You were really controlling
and compulsive and shrill.

265
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:58,141
Well, I'm still all those things!

266
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:03,139
You're also so generous
and kind and scrappy.

267
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:07,908
I am scrappy.

268
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:12,579
Exactly. No matter what I tried to do,
I couldn't keep you out of my life.

269
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:14,281
Of all the people I've cut out...

270
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:17,791
...you were the only one
who ever clawed her way back in.

271
00:20:19,964 --> 00:20:22,023
That's because I'm scrappy.

272
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:25,691
Yeah, you are, and I'm so glad that
you fought your way back in...

273
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,270
...because I don't know what
I would do without you.

274
00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:31,674
I don't know what
I would do without you.

275
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:40,508
Well, I guess we should go back in.
I mean, you gave me another chance.

276
00:20:40,684 --> 00:20:44,484
- We should do the same for Amanda.
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

277
00:20:52,663 --> 00:20:56,155
Can you believe it? I've never had
any professional dance training.

278
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,811
Now, let me explain how this works.
You go into the booth and--

279
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:13,575
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Glenda. Okay?

280
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:16,481
Does it look like this is
my first time?

281
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:21,954
Now, I want four two's,
and I want them all on my back.

282
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:24,294
Okay.

283
00:21:37,341 --> 00:21:43,075
Wait. There's two sets of nozzles!
Which one is it? Which one is it?

284
00:21:44,748 --> 00:21:47,216
Oh, son of a bitch!

285
00:21:53,224 --> 00:21:55,055
Are you kidding?

286
00:21:58,462 --> 00:22:01,022
- How did we do?
- I'm a twelve.

287
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:10,338
What is the matter with us?

288
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,339
Well, I know what's
the matter with me.

289
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:18,004
No, I mean with us, you know?
I mean, is it supposed to be this...

290
00:22:18,482 --> 00:22:20,109
...difficult?

291
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,648
I don't know.

292
00:22:23,854 --> 00:22:28,291
That fake British woman's a real bitch,
but she sure can dance.

293
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:29,824
- Hey.
- Hi.

294
00:22:29,994 --> 00:22:34,192
Hey, listen, can I ask you a question?
When you and Monica first hooked up...

295
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:39,132
...was it weird going from friends
to more than that?

296
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,064
Kind of. Sneaking around,
having to hide from you guys--

297
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,299
No, no, no. No, I mean...

298
00:22:45,476 --> 00:22:47,137
...sexually.

299
00:22:47,311 --> 00:22:52,248
Yeah, was there a part
of you that felt like it was...

300
00:22:52,449 --> 00:22:54,747
...really wrong?

301
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,812
Actually, no.
No, it felt right, you know?

302
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:04,154
If felt like, "l can't believe we haven't
been doing this the whole time."

303
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:09,721
I can tell from your expressions that's
the good news you were hoping for.

304
00:23:12,603 --> 00:23:17,233
Well, I'm gonna go continue
to spread the joy.

305
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:27,114
Just because it happened that way
for them doesn't mean it has to for us.

306
00:23:27,284 --> 00:23:28,945
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

307
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,577
I mean, just because something's
difficult doesn't mean that you quit.

308
00:23:32,756 --> 00:23:34,485
- Right, totally.
- Yeah. And so...

309
00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:38,560
...we'll just keep trying
and trying until we do it.

310
00:23:38,729 --> 00:23:41,220
If not, we'll just be a couple
that never has sex.

311
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:42,990
That's a plan.

312
00:23:57,081 --> 00:24:01,711
- I did not see this coming.
- I know.

313
00:24:02,186 --> 00:24:08,147
I don't know, I don't get it. I mean,
I was so sure this is what I wanted.

314
00:24:09,026 --> 00:24:10,789
Me too.

315
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:18,198
Well, how come Monica
and Chandler could do it?

316
00:24:24,908 --> 00:24:28,309
I guess they weren't
as good friends as we are.

317
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:34,813
I bet you're right.

318
00:24:39,857 --> 00:24:41,518
So....

319
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:46,792
Yeah.

320
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:50,661
I love you.

321
00:24:51,468 --> 00:24:53,629
Love you too.

322
00:24:55,205 --> 00:24:58,641
- All right, I'm going to bed.
- Yeah, me too.

323
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:04,670
Yeah. I'm not going anywhere
for a while.

324
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,959
- Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
- Go away!

325
00:25:18,962 --> 00:25:20,657
I don't wanna see anybody!

326
00:25:20,831 --> 00:25:25,097
I went to the tanning place and the
same thing happened to me. Let me in.

327
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:26,861
Really?

328
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:30,004
Did you count Mississippi-ly?

329
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:32,937
You're not tan.

330
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:39,049
No. I just had to get a picture of this.
I'll see you later.
