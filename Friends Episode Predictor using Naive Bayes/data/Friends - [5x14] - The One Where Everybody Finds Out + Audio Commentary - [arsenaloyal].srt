1
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:06,998
Guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy's
putting stuff in boxes.

2
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,373
I'd say our naked buddy is moving.

3
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:17,480
Ironically, most of the boxes
seem to be labeled "Clothes."

4
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,084
I'm going to miss that big
old squishy butt.

5
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:24,551
And we're done
with the chicken fried rice.

6
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:28,917
If he's moving, maybe I should
try to get his place!

7
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,725
It would be so cool
to live across from you guys.

8
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,058
We could do that telephone thing...

9
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,895
...where you have a can,
we have a can...

10
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,334
...and it's connected by a string.

11
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:44,905
Or we could do
the actual telephone thing.

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,516
He's got packing tape stuck
to where you really don't want it.

13
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:53,880
Get it off, fat man! Get it off!

14
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,912
Oh, no, he's trying to pull it off slowly.

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,255
Take it from me, if you're gonna pull tape
off yourself, it's gotta be in one quick motion.

16
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,158
Like that.

17
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:06,925
The One Where Everyone Finds Out

18
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:54,169
Oh, my God. I love this apartment!

19
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,745
Isn't it perfect?

20
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,578
I can't believe I never realized
how great it is!

21
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,447
Because your eye goes
to the big naked man.

22
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,121
It's amazing!

23
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:08,350
Hurry up with an application,
or I'll beat you to it.

24
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:17,060
Well, I'm going to use
Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.

25
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,875
Look! There's Monica and Chandler.

26
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,308
Hey, you guys!

27
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,416
Chandler and Monica!

28
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,858
Oh, my God!

29
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,154
Oh, my eyes!

30
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,423
My eyes!

31
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,493
It's okay!

32
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,705
-They're doing it!
-I know!

33
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,874
-I know!
-You know?

34
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:59,009
Yes, I know it. Joey knows,
but Ross doesn't, so stop screaming!

35
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,604
What's going on?

36
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,048
-What?
-Nothing!

37
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,254
We are so excited
that you'll get this apartment!

38
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:09,810
Looks really good.

39
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,887
Looks pretty good!

40
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,050
Get in here!
Come on!

41
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,668
You mean whenever
Monica and Chandler...

42
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,034
...were doing laundry
or going grocery shopping?

43
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,368
The time Monica spent on the phone
with Linda from camp?

44
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,943
Doing it, doing it, phone, doing it.

45
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,743
I can't believe it!

46
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,416
I think it's great. For him.

47
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,176
She could do better.

48
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,245
Hey, you guys.

49
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,718
Come here!

50
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,253
Phoebe found out
about Monica and Chandler.

51
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,029
You mean how they're friends
and nothing more?

52
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,799
Joey, she knows.

53
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:58,128
We saw them doing it
through the window.

54
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:02,271
Actually, we saw them doing it
up against the window.

55
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,069
We saw them fornicating.

56
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:12,116
So they know you know,
and they don't know that Rachel knows?

57
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,378
Yes, but it doesn't matter
who knows what.

58
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,085
Now enough of us know
that we could just tell them we know.

59
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,294
All the lying and the secrets
will finally be over.

60
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:26,292
Or, we could not tell them we know,
and have a little fun.

61
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,493
What do you mean?

62
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:33,638
If they say they are doing laundry,
we'll give them laundry to do.

63
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,500
I would enjoy that.

64
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,238
You know what would be even more fun?
Telling them.

65
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,282
-That doesn't sound like fun.
-So we'll make it fun.

66
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,477
We'll do it like a barbershop quartet!

67
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,749
We know, we know, we know

68
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,395
No, I want to do Phoebe's thing.

69
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,585
I can't take

70
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:01,359
You don't have to do anything.
Just don't tell them we know.

71
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,330
I can't take anymore secrets.

72
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,766
I got your secrets, their secrets,
secrets of my own.

73
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,439
You don't have any secrets.

74
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:15,240
Well, you don't know about Hugsy,
my bedtime penguin pal.

75
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,089
How are we going to mess with them?

76
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,015
You could use your position
as the roommate.

77
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,855
And I would use the strongest tool
at my disposal.

78
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,791
My sexuality.

79
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,527
Hello, children.

80
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,133
Watch. Learn.
And don't eat my cookie.

81
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,377
That jacket looks great on you.

82
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,408
-Really?
-The material is so soft.

83
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,412
Hello, Mr. Bicep.

84
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,045
You're working out?

85
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,312
I try to squeeze things.

86
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,129
Are you okay?

87
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,492
If you really want to know

88
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,258
I can't tell you this.

89
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,965
You can tell me anything.

90
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,334
Actually, you are the one person
I can't tell this to.

91
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,168
And the one person I want to the most.

92
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,073
What's going on?

93
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,512
I just haven't been
with a guy in so long...

94
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,344
...and sometimes you're
looking for something...

95
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:33,285
...and it's right there
in front of you, sipping coffee....

96
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,824
Oh, no. Have I said too much?

97
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,494
Just something to think about.
I know I will.

98
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,442
You are so cute.

99
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,348
How did you get to be so cute?

100
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,849
My grandfather was Swedish.

101
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,682
And my grandmother was
a tiny little bunny.

102
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,722
Now you're even cuter.

103
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:14,128
You know, that is a popular
opinion today, I must say.

104
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,995
The weirdest thing happened
at the coffeehouse.

105
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,794
Phoebe was hitting on me.

106
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,733
What are you talking about?

107
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,999
I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.

108
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:28,803
It's not possible.

109
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,688
I'm sorry, Phoebe's just
always thought you were charming...

110
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,982
...in a sexless kind of way.

111
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,091
You know, I can't hear that enough.

112
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,659
I just think you misunderstood her.

113
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,492
I didn't, okay?
She was all over me.

114
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,032
She touched my bicep,
for crying out loud.

115
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:52,726
This bicep?

116
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,901
Well, it's not flexed right now.

117
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,714
Why is it so hard for you to believe
that Phoebe could be attracted to me?

118
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,440
It's not.

119
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,450
All the girls are attracted to you.

120
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,815
You're part bunny.

121
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,386
Mon, you want to come
see a movie with us?

122
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,464
Actually, I was going
to do some laundry.

123
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,535
Want to do it with me?

124
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,729
Sure, I'll do it with you.

125
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,373
Okay, great.
Hold on a second.

126
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,477
Here you go.

127
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,708
That would really help me out a lot.
Thanks.

128
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,544
You know what?
I don't have enough quarters.

129
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,587
I have quarters!

130
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,921
Great. Now we can do laundry all night.
All night laundry!

131
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,197
Hey, any word on the apartment yet?

132
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,998
I called there, and it turns out
Naked Guy is subletting it.

133
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,072
He's already had 100 applicants.

134
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,211
-Oh, man.
-No, no, it's okay.

135
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,940
Because you know what the difference
between them and me is?

136
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,175
Your history of bedwetting?

137
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,386
Hey, I trusted you, man!

138
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,148
Anyway, the difference is...

139
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,690
...I've got the edge.

140
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,589
It's not exactly ethical,
but I sent him a bribe...

141
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,387
...to tip the scales in my direction.

142
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,190
You can see it from the window.

143
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,669
Is it that pinball machine
with the big bow on it?

144
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,406
That new mountain bike?

145
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,843
What did you send?

146
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,879
A basket of mini muffins.

147
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:51,353
There's a whole table of them.
Which one did you send?

148
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,616
The small one.

149
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,229
You actually thought that basket
was going to get you the apartment?

150
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:04,198
Someone sent us a basket at work, and
people went crazy over those muffins.

151
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,030
It was the best day.

152
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,467
Your work makes me sad.

153
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:13,036
Oh, man, I want that place so much!

154
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,941
And I was so sure
that was going to work.

155
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:19,275
There's 12 bucks
I'll never see again.

156
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,586
We'd better go if we want
to catch that movie.

157
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,912
Bye.

158
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,090
Bye, Chandler.
I miss you already.

159
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,132
Did you see that? The inappropriate,
and the pinching?

160
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,494
Actually, I did.

161
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,228
So do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

162
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:45,266
Oh, my God!
She knows about us!

163
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,467
Are you serious?

164
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,012
She knows, and she's trying
to freak us out!

165
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,606
That's the only explanation!

166
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:59,253
But what about my pinchable butt
and my bulging biceps?

167
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,951
She knows!

168
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,029
Phoebe knows about us.

169
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:15,999
I didn't tell them!

170
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,534
Them?

171
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,108
Who's "them"?

172
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,846
Phoebe and Joey.

173
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:27,541
And Rachel.

174
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,351
I would have told you,
but I promised not to tell.

175
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,579
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,385
But it's over now, right?

177
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:39,087
You can tell them you know they know,
and I can go back to knowing nothing!

178
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,065
Unless

179
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,701
Not "unless"!
This must end now!

180
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:48,596
They think they are so slick
messing with us.

181
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,936
But they don't know
that we know that they know.

182
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,368
So

183
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,414
The messers become the messees!

184
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,446
Come on, you guys.
Think how much fun it would be to tell.

185
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:06,455
We know, we know, we know

186
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,426
What?

187
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,527
Oh, that wasn't you.

188
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,338
Honey, you got to stop
torturing yourself.

189
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,564
Why don't you find another apartment?

190
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,673
I've already looked
at 1000 apartments this month.

191
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,243
None of them even compares
to that one.

192
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:33,010
Well, except for one, but I would have had
to share it with an Armenian family.

193
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,676
Grandma really liked me.

194
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,422
But I want Ugly Naked apartment!

195
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,454
You know what?

196
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:45,824
You should find out his hobbies
and use that to bond with him.

197
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,965
Like if I wanted something from Joey...

198
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,364
...I would strike up a conversation
about sandwiches...

199
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,435
...or my underwear.

200
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,808
I'm listening.

201
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,280
That is a great idea!

202
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:09,079
And I know Ugly Naked Guy because
we've been watching him for five years.

203
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,451
So that gives me back my edge!

204
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,722
Let's see now.
He had the trampoline.

205
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:16,884
He broke that.

206
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,724
-He had gravity boots.
-He broke those too.

207
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,125
So he likes to break stuff.

208
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:30,564
I've got to go pick up Ben.
But I will figure something out.

209
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,607
Didn't he used to have a cat?

210
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,575
I wouldn't bring that up.
It would bum him out.

211
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,613
Poor cat never saw
that big butt coming.

212
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,821
Hold on a second,
she's right here.

213
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:47,981
It's Chandler.

214
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,097
Hello, you.

215
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,632
Phoebe, I've been thinking
about you all day.

216
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,605
You know that thing you said before?
I was intrigued.

217
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,169
Really?

218
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,038
Joey won't be here tonight.

219
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,010
Why don't you come over?
I'll let you feel my bicep.

220
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,308
Or maybe more.

221
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,119
I'll have to get back to you on that.

222
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,828
He wants me to come over
and feel his bicep and more!

223
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,023
Are you kidding?

224
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,723
I cannot believe
he would do that to Mon

225
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,341
Joey? Do they know that we know?

226
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,012
They know you know.

227
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,740
I knew it!

228
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,851
I would say, "Thank God!
Everybody knows! It's finally over!"

229
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,753
But that hasn't been working for me.

230
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,326
I cannot believe those two!

231
00:14:56,495 --> 00:15:00,295
They thought they could mess with us?
Trying to mess with us?

232
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,662
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

233
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,306
Joey, you can't say anything.

234
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,404
Couldn't if I wanted to.

235
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:23,287
Good evening, sir. I'm Ross Geller.
I'm one of the applicants.

236
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,550
I realize that the competition
is fierce but....

237
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:33,824
I'm sorry, I can't help but notice
that you're naked.

238
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,228
I applaud you.

239
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,372
Man, I wish I was naked.

240
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,044
I mean, this looks so great.

241
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,040
That is how God intended it.

242
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,345
Look. They're panicked!

243
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,918
They'll totally back down.

244
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,655
If he wants a date,
he's going to get a date.

245
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,483
I'm going to go in.

246
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,159
Be sexy.

247
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:05,721
Please.

248
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,506
I'd love to come by tonight.

249
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,404
Really?

250
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,743
Absolutely.
Say, around 7?

251
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:35,216
I'm really looking forward to you
and me having sexual intercourse.

252
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,733
Hey, check it out!

253
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,766
Naked Guy's got a naked friend.

254
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,212
Oh, my God!
That's our friend!

255
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,076
It's Naked Ross!

256
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,324
Would you like another mini muffin?

257
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,393
Try the blueberry, they're delicious.

258
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,396
Showtime!

259
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,427
Rachel, get me perfume.

260
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,573
Joey, can you get me
a bottle of wine and glasses?

261
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:36,921
All right, thanks, but glasses that do not
have handles and that are glass.

262
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:40,023
And wine that is not olive oil.

263
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:45,859
Make her think you want to have
sex with her and it will freak her out.

264
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,964
How far am I gonna have to go with her?

265
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,170
She'll give in way before you do.

266
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,326
How do you know?

267
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,838
Because you're on my team.
My team always wins.

268
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,178
At this?

269
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,237
Just go get some! Go!

270
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,013
Now, I'm going to try to listen
from right here.

271
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,482
Oh, wait.

272
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,417
Good idea.

273
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,852
Don't give away the farm.

274
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,925
Come on in.

275
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,530
I was going to.

276
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,874
I brought some wine.
Would you like some?

277
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,340
Sure.

278
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,854
So here we are.

279
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,215
Nervous?

280
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,914
Me? No. You?

281
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,091
I want this to happen.

282
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,387
So do l.

283
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,436
I'm going to put on some music.

284
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,352
Joey likes to scare the duck.

285
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,788
Maybe I'll dance for you.

286
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,805
You look good.

287
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,782
Thanks.

288
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:51,287
You know, when you say
things like that, it makes me...

289
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,287
...want to rip that
sweater vest right off.

290
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,096
Why don't we move into the bedroom?

291
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,253
Really?

292
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,456
Do you not want to?

293
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,331
First I want to take off
all my clothes...

294
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,804
...and have you rub lotion on me.

295
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,607
That would be nice.

296
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,381
I'll go get the lotion.

297
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,481
It's way out of hand.
She wants me to put lotion on her!

298
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,387
-She's bluffing!
-She's not backing down.

299
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,288
She went like this

300
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,397
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

301
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,794
It's Chandler. You can take him.

302
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,428
Come on. Don't you remember when
you made him cry using only your words?

303
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,867
Aren't you guys done yet?

304
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,273
I want to sit in my chair!

305
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:54,709
The sooner Phoebe breaks him, the sooner
it's over and out in the open.

306
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,851
I like that.

307
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,923
Show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

308
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:10,926
You didn't rip off any buttons.

309
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,627
It's not my first time.

310
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,942
Go back there and seduce her
till she cracks!

311
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,611
Give me a second.

312
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,381
-Did you clean up in here?
-Of course!

313
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,551
You're going?

314
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,948
Not without you, lover.

315
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:42,261
So this is my bra.

316
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,169
It's very, very nice.

317
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,303
Well, come here.

318
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,506
I'm very happy we're going
to have all the sex.

319
00:21:57,182 --> 00:22:00,583
You should be.
I'm very bendy.

320
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,621
I'll kiss you now.

321
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,689
Not if I kiss you first.

322
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,881
I guess there's nothing
left for us to do but kiss.

323
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,479
Here it comes.

324
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,211
Our first kiss.

325
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:48,690
You win!

326
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:50,924
I can't have sex with you!

327
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,128
-And why not?
-I'm in love with Monica!

328
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,737
You're what?

329
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,064
Love her!

330
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,705
I love her!

331
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,436
I love her!

332
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,716
I love you, Monica.

333
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,612
I love you too, Chandler.

334
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,662
I thought you were doing it.
I didn't know you were in love!

335
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,229
Dude!

336
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,229
Hats off to Phoebe.
Quite a competitor.

337
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,440
May I say your breasts are still showing.

338
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:34,772
God.

339
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,539
All right!
So that's it?

340
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,478
It's over.
Everybody knows!

341
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,276
Actually, Ross doesn't.

342
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,954
We'd appreciate it
if no one told him yet.

343
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,755
Well, here it is.

344
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,957
A new place for a new Ross.

345
00:23:56,234 --> 00:24:00,000
I'll have you and the guys from work
over, once it's furnished.

346
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,331
It's nice to see you
back on your feet.

347
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:06,566
I am that, and the whole rage thing
is definitely behind me.

348
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,940
I wonder if it's time for you
to rejoin our museum team?

349
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,513
That would be great.

350
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,116
I am totally ready
to come back to work.

351
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,252
