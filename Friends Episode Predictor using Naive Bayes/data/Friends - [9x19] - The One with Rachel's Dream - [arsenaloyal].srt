1
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:04,300
God, you're beautiful.

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,303
Why are we fighting this?

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,336
You know you want it to happen
as much as l do.

4
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:15,907
l want you. l need you.

5
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,251
Let me make love to you.

6
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:23,920
l don't wanna stand in the way
of true love or anything...

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,423
...but l think a cantaloupe
might hurt less.

8
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,994
No, l'm rehearsing my lines.

9
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,961
They're giving me a romantic story
on <i>Days of Our Lives</i>.

10
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,897
lt's the first time my character's gotten one.
l'm nervous. l want it to be good.

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,530
l haven't seen you this worked-up since
you did that dog-food commercial...

12
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:45,939
...and you thought you were gonna be
with a real talking dog.

13
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:48,672
Yeah, that was a disappointment.

14
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:52,784
You wanna come down to the set
and tell me if l'm doing okay?

15
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:54,544
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

16
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,552
You just have to promise not
to get thrown out again.

17
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:00,487
-That was an honest mistake.
-Right.

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,063
''Oh, my God. ls this the men's room?
l feel so foolish.

19
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:09,065
Have you always known
you wanted to be an actor?''

20
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:13,299
Yeah, that was an awesome day.

21
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,644
-Hey.
-Hey.

22
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,549
You guys wanna come eat dinner
at the restaurant in the next few weeks?

23
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,479
-l'd love to.
-Well, you can't.

24
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,347
-We're booked solid for the next month.
-Well, l can't give you a massage...

25
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,982
...because my license
has been revoked again.

26
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,722
-Phoebe, what happened?
-Well, it was an accident, you know.

27
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:15,334
lt's a lot of oil and sometimes
the hand just slips.

28
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,366
So the restaurant's doing well, you say?

29
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,304
lt is so great. There are people
lining up in the street...

30
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,877
...to taste my food. Saturday,
there's a waiting list of 50 people.

31
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:30,174
l know how that feels.
Last semester, l had two students...

32
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,808
...who wanted to take my 1 :00 class,
but it was full.

33
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,889
So they had to take my 5:00.

34
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,251
That's not the same.

35
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,893
Have l got a surprise for you.
Pack your bags.

36
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:50,502
Oh, no. You guys aren't supposed
to get divorced for seven years.

37
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:55,336
What? No, l'm taking Monica
to a romantic inn in Vermont.

38
00:02:55,508 --> 00:03:01,071
Oh, good. Okay, good for you.
Trying to recapture the magic.

39
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,780
-So can you get out of work?
-Honey, l can't.

40
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:08,717
-Things are crazy at the restaurant.
-You're really that busy?

41
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,584
Yeah. l'm sorry, l really am.

42
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:15,091
That's okay. l'll just try and reschedule.

43
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,123
Hi, this is Chandler Bing.
l made a reservation there...

44
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,665
...and l need to change it.

45
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:26,531
What do you mean, it's nonrefundable?
Well, can l just come some other time?

46
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,199
Can't you make an exception?

47
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,208
Tell them l'm a chef
at a big New York restaurant.

48
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:36,815
Tell them that in two weeks, l will once
again be a masseuse in good standing.

49
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,881
Look, this is ridiculous.
l'm not paying for that room, okay?

50
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,922
Well, thank you very much.

51
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,156
Yeah, l'm going to Vermont.

52
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:52,197
-Don't worry, use your travel insurance.
-l don't have travel insurance.

53
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,526
Well, this is what happens
when people live on the edge.

54
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,969
-Honey, what are you gonna do?
-l'll go.

55
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,664
Okay, l'll pick you up at 1 0.

56
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,309
Oh, go with you?

57
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,138
Oh, l can't go.

58
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,413
Why don't you take Ross?

59
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,783
Don't you think that'll be a little weird?
l mean, two guys in a romantic inn?

60
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,856
-No, not if the room has two beds.
-l guess.

61
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,963
lt still seems a little--
''Moonlight boat ride''?!

62
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,761
Joey, is this the bed
where Olivia lost her virginity?

63
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,635
l don't know,
but one of the extras sure did.

64
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:39,266
Listen, Rach. Thanks again
for coming down to watch my scenes.

65
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,971
Please, honey. Just the fact that you
want me here to support you, l'm--

66
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:47,984
Oh, my God. ls that Christian Saunders?
He is so gorgeous!

67
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,849
And also, so gay.

68
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,960
Well, in my head,
he's done some pretty not-gay stuff.

69
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:59,530
Well, at the Christmas party, him
and Santa did some definitely-gay stuff.

70
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,894
Joey? Joey, we're ready for you.

71
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,127
Okay. All right, wish me luck.

72
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,001
Okay. Not that you need it, but good--
God! ls that Chase Lassiter?

73
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:11,401
-He's straight, right?
-Rach, if you weren't here wondering...

74
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:15,172
...if these guys were gay,
l don't know if l could do this.

75
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,476
l'm sorry, you're right.
l'm sorry. Good luck.

76
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,143
On a bell, please. Quietly.

77
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,119
And action!

78
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,451
Drake, what are you doing here?

79
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,492
Stopping you from marrying
the wrong man...

80
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,789
...and making the biggest
mistake of your life.

81
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,057
-Get out.
-You don't love him.

82
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,825
What do you know about love?

83
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,835
l know what l felt that night
when we kissed under the bridge.

84
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,668
-That kiss never happened.
-Well, what about this one?

85
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,542
Now, l told you to get out.

86
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,682
Fine, l'll go.

87
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,414
But let me ask you one question.

88
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:56,851
-You look real familiar. Have we--?
-Shh! He's asking her a question.

89
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:01,750
Can you live the rest of your life never
knowing what we could have been?

90
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,929
-l don't have a choice.
-Yes, you do.

91
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:09,694
Yes, you do. l'm the one who doesn't
have a choice because l....

92
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,598
Because l can't stop loving you.

93
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:17,008
-Don't say that.
-Tell me to stop.

94
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,800
Just...

95
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,938
...tell me to stop.

96
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,946
-Cut!
-No!

97
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:30,578
Or, cut. You know, that's your call.

98
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,449
-Everything was delicious.
-Thank you.

99
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:37,152
lt was. The duck in particular
was superb.

100
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,127
Thank you.

101
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,165
You haven't said anything.

102
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,428
Actually, l do have one small complaint.

103
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:52,237
Well, please, l welcome criticism.

104
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,177
The musician right outside the restaurant
is kind of a mood killer.

105
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,508
What musician?

106
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,903
What are you doing here?

107
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:22,598
You said you had customers lined up
in the street, so l'm here to entertain.

108
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,074
-Great.
-Yeah, it really has been great too.

109
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,179
They must have seen me
play before...

110
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,815
...because they requested
a bunch of my songs.

111
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,349
Yeah, ''You Suck'' ...

112
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,487
...and ''Shut Up and Go Home.''

113
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,784
Listen, Phoebe. You know how much
l love listening to your music...

114
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,794
-...but....
-But what?

115
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,867
This is kind of a classy place.

116
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,667
Okay, say no more.

117
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,536
Everyone!

118
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,276
Classy, huh?

119
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,824
Hi, Chandler Bing. l have a reservation.

120
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,892
Welcome to the Chestnut lnn.
Where are you joining us from?

121
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,291
-New York.
-The Big Apple.

122
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:22,258
He's wound up. We had to stop at every
maple-candy stand on the way here.

123
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,700
l ate all my gifts for everybody.

124
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,472
l'm sorry, there's no record
of your reservation in the computer.

125
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:34,840
-That's impossible. Check again, please.
-Check again, please.

126
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,543
-l'm sorry, it's not here.
-lt's not there.

127
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,746
Let me get this straight. l called
to try to cancel my reservation...

128
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:47,757
...was told it's not refundable. Then we
drove six hours all the way up here...

129
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:51,090
-...and now we don't have a reservation?
-l don't know what to say.

130
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,527
She doesn't know what to say.

131
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,826
Just give us
the cheapest room you have.

132
00:08:56,035 --> 00:09:00,062
The only thing we have available
is our deluxe suite. The rate is $600.

133
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,673
-That's insane.
-lt's totally insane.

134
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:06,869
Dude, let's drive home. We'll hit all the
maple-candy stores on the way back...

135
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:11,676
...and if they're closed, then maybe we'll
tap a tree and make some ourselves.

136
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,710
Does that room have a closet
l can lock him in?

137
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,755
-We'll take it.
-Great.

138
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,388
They are totally ripping us off!
Three hundred dollars each?

139
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,293
''Each?'' l'm your date.

140
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,732
So l pay for everything
and have no sex.

141
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,668
Oh, life before Monica.

142
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,204
Dude, don't worry about it.

143
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:40,436
l know how to make your money back.
This is a nice hotel. Plenty of amenities.

144
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:45,414
We just load up on those.
Like those apples. lnstead of taking one...

145
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,815
...l take six.

146
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,118
Great. At $ 1 00 an apple, we're there.

147
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,591
Come on, you get the idea. You know,
we'll make our money back in no time.

148
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:00,288
-Dude, you're shaking.
-lt's the sugar. Could you hold the apple?

149
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,237
-Hi.
-Hey.

150
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:12,207
Joey, l gotta tell you, l have been
thinking all day about that scene you did.

151
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,505
l mean, you were amazing.

152
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:18,012
You know, the writing was good.
And the director's good.

153
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,311
And my costar's good.

154
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,511
But they're not as good as me!

155
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,150
You have to tell me
what happens tomorrow.

156
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,055
l'm going over the script now.
Wanna read lines with me?

157
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,786
Me? Oh, l'm not an actress.

158
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,833
-All right, l can ask Monica.
-Screw her! That part is mine!

159
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,767
Okay, so just from the top
of the page right here.

160
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,566
Okay.

161
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,011
Hello, Drake.
l'm surprised to see you here.

162
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,445
-l can't believe you married him.
-Well, what choice did l have?

163
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,916
He was keeping my sister in a dungeon.

164
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:00,821
So, what about us?
Everything we feel for each other?

165
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,461
lt's over. You have to accept that.

166
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:08,123
How can l, knowing l'll never
hold you in my arms again...

167
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,396
...or touch your skin or feel your lips...

168
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,566
...knowing l'll never make love to you?

169
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,234
How can l accept
that l can never kiss you again...

170
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,438
...when it's all l can do
not to kiss you right now?

171
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:26,945
Kiss me.

172
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,620
What?

173
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,055
Kiss me.

174
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,960
-Rach, it doesn't say that.
-No, l'm saying it.

175
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,596
-But--
-Just don't talk.

176
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,708
Well, that's new.

177
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,841
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206.

178
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,816
l've forgotten a couple of things.

179
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:07,254
Could you have some complimentary
toiletries sent up to my room?

180
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,226
Thank you.
Okay, a toothbrush, toothpaste...

181
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:17,427
...razor, mouthwash, deodorant, floss,
Band-Aids, shaving cream, after-shave.

182
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,662
And l feel like l'm forgetting something.

183
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,866
ls there anything else you have
that l haven't asked for already?

184
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:28,008
Yeah, go ahead,
send up some tampons.

185
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,043
-What'd you get?
-<i>USA Today.</i>

186
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,243
Nice. Put it with the others.

187
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:38,423
And l also got two more apples.

188
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,558
We're four short of a bushel!

189
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:45,554
God, l feel so alive.
l love being in the country!

190
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:48,063
Also, got these great
salt and pepper shakers...

191
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,566
-...from the restaurant.
-That's not cool.

192
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,467
Dude, none of this is cool.

193
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,601
Look, Chandler, you have to find
the line between stealing...

194
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,076
...and taking what the hotel owes you.

195
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,080
For example: A hair dryer, no, no.

196
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,377
But shampoos and conditioners,
yes, yes.

197
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:12,112
Now, the salt shaker is off limits.

198
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:16,227
But the salt....

199
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,295
l wish l'd thought this through.

200
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,325
l think l get what you mean, though.
Like, the lamp is the hotel's...

201
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,699
...but the bulbs--
Oh, you already got that.

202
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,807
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.

203
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,739
-Okay, how about this?
-No, no, no.

204
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:37,406
-You can't take the remote control.
-Yes, but the batteries.

205
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,149
Thank you. Thank you very much.

206
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,817
-Let's celebrate with some maple candy.
-No!

207
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,163
At least tell me where you hid it.

208
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,137
-Can l ask you a question?
-Yeah.

209
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,430
Have you ever had any...

210
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:07,136
...weird, romantic dreams?

211
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,972
Let me think.

212
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:15,449
When l was younger, l used to dream
that l got married to Mayor McCheese.

213
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,681
And on our wedding night,
l ate his head.

214
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,987
Okay.

215
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,296
Well, this is like that...

216
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,364
...in no way.

217
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,492
l had a dream last night
that l wanted to kiss Joey.

218
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,639
Wow! You mean like
''kiss him'' kiss him?

219
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:38,140
Oh, yeah.
l mean, it was pretty intense.

220
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,471
-What brought that on?
-l don't know.

221
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,672
Maybe it had to do with the fact
l saw him do a love scene.

222
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,215
-A love scene? With who?
-Olivia.

223
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,684
Olivia?! l thought she was
marrying Connor?!

224
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,983
Oh, right. Real life more important.

225
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,628
-You think my dream means anything?
-l don't know.

226
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,025
l mean, you saw him do a love scene.

227
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,100
So maybe you don't have a thing for Joey.
Maybe you have a thing for Drake.

228
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,276
Well, it was Joey reading
Drake's lines in the dream.

229
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:15,209
Of course it was. Trust me,
when it comes to psychology...

230
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,612
...l know what l'm talking about.

231
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,979
l took two psych classes in college.

232
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,984
You took the same class twice.

233
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,715
-lt was hard!
-l know.

234
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,724
-Hey.
-Hi, Phoebe.

235
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:33,354
Here, Monica, look what l got to wear
when l play at your restaurant.

236
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,467
Wait.

237
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:46,742
Right? l think this might even class up
''The Ballad of the Uncircumcised Man.''

238
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,208
Phoebe...

239
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,874
...maybe l wasn't clear before.

240
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:57,978
l really love listening
to your music here.

241
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,057
But my restaurant,
it's sort of an upscale place.

242
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,993
Right, yeah, okay. l'll ask the butler
to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.

243
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,065
Phoebe, it's not what you wear.

244
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,896
lt's sort of your songs.

245
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,631
l just don't think you should play
at the restaurant anymore.

246
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,311
Okay. Fine, l'll just--

247
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,505
l'll take the hat back.

248
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,813
There.

249
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,653
Hey, so, you guys, the funniest
thing happened at work the--

250
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,990
My songs aren't good enough
for your restaurant?

251
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,758
Okay, we're still on that.

252
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,459
-l didn't say they weren't good enough.
-Then what's wrong with them?

253
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:48,765
What, they don't go with your
tiny portions of pretentious food?

254
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,276
-Tiny portions?
-Yeah, well, ''Excuse me.

255
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:57,643
l ordered the smoked salmon appetizer,
but l can't see it. l can't see it.''

256
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,744
-Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
-Well, it's not about quality.

257
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,988
Oh, really?
You wanna talk about quality?

258
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:11,526
Have you ever heard of a ''key''?
lt's what some people sing in.

259
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:15,656
Well, at least all my songs
don't taste like garlic.

260
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,359
Yeah, there are other
ingredients, Monica.

261
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,997
So that's what we're doing.

262
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,165
When l'm in a coffeehouse bopping
along to one of your songs...

263
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,742
...l'm wearing earplugs.

264
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,072
Earplugs or cloves of garlic?

265
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,210
You know what?
l take back what l said before.

266
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:36,218
Keep playing at the restaurant, because
with your music driving people inside...

267
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,185
...my bar sales
have gone up like crazy.

268
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,326
What are people having,
the garlic martini?

269
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,331
So you wanna hear my work story?

270
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:52,895
l'll save it.

271
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,939
Here's your bill.
We hope you enjoyed your stay.

272
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,772
Oh, we did.
And you still have all your lamps.

273
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,682
-l didn't factor in the room tax.
-Dude, don't worry about it.

274
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,254
l found an unattended maid's cart.
We're way ahead of the game.

275
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,390
-Oh, my God.
-What?

276
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:18,189
There's something new in the bowl.

277
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:23,164
-Look, we have enough. Just walk away.
-No, but l want the pine cones.

278
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,767
-There's a forest right outside.
-lt's not the same.

279
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:31,339
-No, look. She's gonna see us.
-No, she won't. l'm sly.

280
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,801
Okay, go quick.

281
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,119
Thank you for a delightful stay.

282
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,860
My maple candy!

283
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:11,112
lt's just you. l thought someone was
swinging a bag of cats against the wall.

284
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:15,079
You'd better get back in that kitchen.
The garlic's not gonna overuse itself.

285
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,646
-Okay, you have to stop playing now.
-Why?

286
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,122
The only person my playing
is bothering is you.

287
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:26,492
-Oh, yeah? Let's settle this. Come on.
-Get your garlic peelers off me.

288
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,100
Excuse me? Excuse me?

289
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,795
Hi, l'm Monica Geller.
l'm the head chef here.

290
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,965
Okay, l was actually expecting
a little applause there, but whatever.

291
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,940
Quick question.
By a show of hands...

292
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,707
...how many of you were bothered
by this woman's singing outside?

293
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,313
Okay, okay. Well, l have a question.

294
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,882
You can put your hand down.

295
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:54,082
You made your point earlier
when you spit in my guitar case.

296
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,160
Okay, okay. How many of you
enjoyed the music outside?

297
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,899
Let me ask you this question.
How many thought the music was fine...

298
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,537
...but not in keeping with the tone
of the restaurant?

299
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:13,504
Okay, well, who identified this restaurant's
tone as ''pretentious-comma-garlicky''?

300
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,811
Okay, who thinks the food is delicious
and a little pretension never hurt anyone?

301
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:24,044
Okay, well, all right, who thinks
the food is fine, the music was fine...

302
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,750
...but your evening was ruined
by this incessant poll-taking?

303
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,693
Excuse us.

304
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,563
All right, here's a question.

305
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,771
Who was so worried about
her restaurant being fancy...

306
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:46,138
...that she made a big deal about
her friend playing her music...

307
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,610
...and feels really bad about it now?

308
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,243
Well, who was so stupid
and stubborn...

309
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,886
...that she lashed out
against her friend's cooking...

310
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,716
...which she actually thinks
is pretty great?

311
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,493
-l'm sorry.
-l'm sorry too.

312
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,763
Hey, you wanna stick around
and l'll whip you up some dinner?

313
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,795
Yeah, as long as it's free.

314
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:10,560
The food here is ridiculously overpr--

315
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:17,036
Who hopes the hand-raising thing is still
cute enough that you won't hate me?

316
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,541
-Hey.
-Hey.

317
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:27,910
Joey, do you have peanut butter
on the back of your head?

318
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,187
Oh, man. l thought l got it all.

319
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,117
How...?

320
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,093
How?

321
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,799
l was making a peanut butter
smoothie, right?

322
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:46,131
l couldn't find this little plastic thingy
that goes in the top of the blender.

323
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,469
And l thought, ''Well, you know,
how important can that be?'' Right?

324
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,806
Turns out, very.

325
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,547
Wow, definitely just Drake.

326
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,379
-What?
-How's it going with Drake?

327
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,851
-l don't think it's going very well.
-What?

328
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,886
That scene l saw was so good.

329
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,720
Well, l'm feeling really insecure
about the one we're shooting tomorrow.

330
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:14,158
ls this that thing you do when you say
you're bad so l'll give you a compliment?

331
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,262
A little.

332
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:23,039
No, l really am worried. l have to make it
convincing that l'm in love with Olivia.

333
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,200
-So?
-So l've never played that.

334
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:30,212
Oh, honey, it can't be that hard.
l mean, you've been in love before.

335
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,249
Well, just once...

336
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,182
...with you.

337
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,555
Okay. Well, this could be
a little awkward.

338
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,058
l'm just gonna blow past it.

339
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:46,254
Well, look, can't you just use
that method-actor thing...

340
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:50,059
...where you use your real-life memories
to help you in your performance?

341
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,936
What the hell are you talking about?

342
00:22:57,242 --> 00:23:02,236
All right, look, just try to remember
how you felt when you were in love...

343
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,906
...and think about that
when you're playing the scene.

344
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:11,452
Okay. Yeah, l think l can do that.

345
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:14,717
Yeah. Okay, there's this
party scene coming up.

346
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,157
And Olivia and her husband are there...

347
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:21,663
...and all Drake wants to do is
grab her and kiss her, but he can't.

348
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:27,229
That makes me think about those times
l wanted to grab you and kiss you...

349
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,671
...but you didn't know, so l would
just pretend everything was cool...

350
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,901
...but really it was killing me.

351
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,940
Joey, you never
talked about that before.

352
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,577
Hey, you know what else l could use?

353
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:47,522
There's this scene where Drake
sneaks into Olivia's bedroom...

354
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,889
...and she doesn't know he's there,
which never happened with us.

355
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:58,459
l mean, he knows he shouldn't be there,
but he just wants to look at her.

356
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,305
You know?

357
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:06,467
And l remember all those mornings
before you even put on your makeup...

358
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:12,015
...when l would think to myself,
''My God, she is beautiful.''

359
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:18,155
And it hurt so much because
l knew l could never tell you.

360
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:25,759
But it was worth it just to be there
looking at you.

361
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,037
Thanks, dude. This is great!

362
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,748
l got you something from Vermont.

363
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,113
Besides tampons and salt?

364
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,418
Oh, my God.

365
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:56,186
Maple candy. That's so sweet of you.

366
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,220
That's weird, it's empty.

367
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:04,024
Hi, you guys. What's going on?
You guys wanna hang out or...?

368
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,042
Do you guys hear a buzzing?

369
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,837
