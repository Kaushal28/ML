1
00:00:07,819 --> 00:00:09,252
What's so funny?

2
00:00:09,488 --> 00:00:14,187
Nothing. lt's an acting exercise.
l'm practicing my fake laugh.

3
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,224
What? What's so funny?

4
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:27,066
No, no. There's none of that in here.

5
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,970
Come on, man. At least let me
finish this last one.

6
00:00:31,143 --> 00:00:33,043
Only if you give me a drag.

7
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,047
Okay.

8
00:00:41,753 --> 00:00:45,211
Oh, dark mother, once again
l suckle at your smoky teat.

9
00:00:48,327 --> 00:00:51,194
No, why don't you hold on to that one.

10
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:02,997
Okay, that's like
the least fun game ever.

11
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:06,076
l'm sick of your smoking,
so l brought something...

12
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:09,303
...that is going to help you quit.

13
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,253
Nope. That patch is no good.

14
00:01:21,426 --> 00:01:23,018
lt's a hypnosis tape.

15
00:01:23,261 --> 00:01:26,958
A woman at work used it for two weeks
and hasn't smoked since.

16
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:31,024
What's your problem?

17
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:35,596
Nothing. lt's just that
hypnosis is beyond crap.

18
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,571
l watched you get hypnotized
in Atlantic City.

19
00:01:39,778 --> 00:01:42,212
That guy did not hypnotize me, okay?

20
00:01:42,414 --> 00:01:46,441
You always pull your pants down
and play ''Wipe Out'' on your butt.

21
00:01:48,286 --> 00:01:50,345
l was trying to distract attention...

22
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:55,459
...from that poor, old woman who was
trying to stuff her breasts into tube socks.

23
00:01:55,627 --> 00:01:56,992
Forget hypnosis.

24
00:01:57,162 --> 00:02:00,825
The way to quit smoking is to
dance naked in a field of heather...

25
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:04,730
...and then bathe in the sweat
of six healthy, young men.

26
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,865
Or what my father calls
''Thursday night.''

27
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:11,735
The One With the Hypnosis Tape

28
00:02:57,789 --> 00:03:00,952
-Here you go.
-l didn't want cinnamon on this.

29
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,318
Sorry.

30
00:03:10,635 --> 00:03:13,195
-Hi.
-Oh, my God! Frank!

31
00:03:14,773 --> 00:03:15,899
How are you?

32
00:03:16,174 --> 00:03:17,835
What are you doing here?

33
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:20,772
l would've called,
but l lost your number.

34
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:25,210
And then my mom locked me out
of the house, so l couldn't find it.

35
00:03:25,617 --> 00:03:30,020
Then l tried to find a pay phone,
and the receiver was cut off.

36
00:03:31,623 --> 00:03:33,215
What happened?

37
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:35,851
Vandalism.

38
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:39,861
But also, what happened
between you and your mom?

39
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:44,528
We got in a fight. She said that
l was too immature to get married.

40
00:03:44,803 --> 00:03:47,135
-You're getting married?
-Oh, yeah!

41
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:52,702
My little brother's getting married!

42
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,110
l knew you'd be so cool about this.
Do you wanna meet her?

43
00:03:57,382 --> 00:03:58,542
Do l?

44
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:00,212
Do you?

45
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:02,243
Yeah, l do.

46
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:06,480
Cool, all right.
She's just parking the truck.

47
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:11,652
-l gonna go get my fiancêe, man!
-All right.

48
00:04:12,564 --> 00:04:17,058
l'd have bet good money that he'd be
the first one of us to get married.

49
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:18,862
lsn't it fantastic?

50
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:22,231
Don't you think he's
a little young to get married?

51
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:23,498
Well, he's 1 8.

52
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:27,202
lt'll be illegal for him to drink
at his own bachelor party.

53
00:04:27,813 --> 00:04:30,247
Yeah, or to get a hooker.

54
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:33,280
Always illegal, Joe.

55
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:38,378
Hey, this is my fiancêe...

56
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:40,548
...Mrs. Knight.

57
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:45,323
-That's my sister.
-You know, it's funny.

58
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,728
Frank told me so much about you, but
you're not how l pictured you at all.

59
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:52,768
Yeah, l'm a big surprise.

60
00:04:52,938 --> 00:04:54,599
-Here, you go.
-Thank you.

61
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:55,967
Here, grab a seat.

62
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,768
So how did you guys meet?

63
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:01,742
Well, l was in Mrs. Knight's--

64
00:05:01,913 --> 00:05:05,872
l mean, Alice. Sorry, Alice.
l always do that.

65
00:05:07,986 --> 00:05:11,547
-l was in her home-ec class.
-He was my best student.

66
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,918
Yeah. She was my best teacher.

67
00:05:23,568 --> 00:05:26,435
lf that doesn't keep kids in school,
what will?

68
00:05:28,974 --> 00:05:31,636
And so now you guys
are gonna be married?

69
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,975
Yeah. We talked about
just living together...

70
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,218
...but we want kids right away.

71
00:05:42,654 --> 00:05:44,884
Oh, my God!

72
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:46,580
Great!

73
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:51,290
Kids. Frank, are you sure
you're ready for that?

74
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,288
How hard can it be?

75
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:57,934
You know, l mean, it's babies.
Who doesn't want babies? Right?

76
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:01,469
And besides,
l never had a dad around.

77
00:06:01,673 --> 00:06:05,074
And now l always will,
because it'll be me.

78
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:07,438
-Yeah.
-Right?

79
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,082
Really, we do realize that there's
an age difference between us.

80
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:15,913
Good. Because you were
acting like you didn't.

81
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:20,524
Oh, no, but when it comes to love,
what does age matter?

82
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:29,361
You are falling fast asleep.

83
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:32,363
Deeper, deeper, deeper.

84
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:35,271
You are now completely asleep.

85
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:37,702
You don't need to smoke.

86
00:06:37,976 --> 00:06:40,536
Cigarettes don't control you.

87
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:43,939
You are a strong, confident woman...

88
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:46,683
...who does not need to smoke.

89
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:50,888
A strong, confident woman.

90
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:53,146
You know what?

91
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:57,386
l realized in the last year l've
only gone out with Richard and Julio.

92
00:06:57,896 --> 00:07:01,195
You gotta help me out, set me up.
Get me back in the game.

93
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,423
Not a problem.

94
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:06,831
l work in fashion, and all l meet
are eligible straight men.

95
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:10,799
Can l get you something else?

96
00:07:10,976 --> 00:07:14,673
Cheesecake and a date,
if you're giving them out.

97
00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:18,077
-Haven't we covered that topic?
-You just said to her--

98
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:20,011
You wanna go out with me...

99
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:23,484
...because of my wig, boobs,
and because l serve you food.

100
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:27,488
Well, if that were true,
l'd be dating my Aunt Ruth.

101
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:31,790
And the two times we went out,
it was just plain awkward.

102
00:07:32,297 --> 00:07:35,698
Come on. You think she should
go out with me, don't you?

103
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:40,805
Well, l mean, are you sure
you wanna go out with her?

104
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:44,032
That ain't a pretty picture
in the morning.

105
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:48,873
That wig all in disarray,
and boobs flung over the nightstand.

106
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:52,942
-l mean, think about it.
-Oh, l will.

107
00:07:55,787 --> 00:08:00,815
No, l know. l know that
this is Frank's life. You know.

108
00:08:00,992 --> 00:08:04,450
l don't wanna be judgmental,
but it's sick. lt's sick and wrong!

109
00:08:05,864 --> 00:08:07,855
What, is it the age thing?

110
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:09,694
l'm fine with the age thing...

111
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:13,702
...until it sticks its tongue
down my little brother's throat.

112
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,631
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.

113
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:21,472
You think he'll enjoy it when he's
up to his elbows in diapers...

114
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:25,046
...of all the babies
they have to have right away?

115
00:08:25,383 --> 00:08:29,376
This is not fair to Frank,
and it's not fair to the babies.

116
00:08:29,554 --> 00:08:32,182
You know what?
lt's not good home economics.

117
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,854
Well, have you told him how you feel?

118
00:08:37,028 --> 00:08:39,963
Yes. Not out loud.

119
00:08:40,632 --> 00:08:43,829
-Pheebs, he's not a mind reader.
-We don't know that.

120
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,704
lf you don't tell him, soon he'll be
married, then you'll hate yourself.

121
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:53,605
Yeah, but if l do tell him,
then he's gonna hate myself.

122
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:58,147
Look at him and his mom.
l can't.

123
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:01,508
But you guys can.
You talk him out of it.

124
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:03,779
No, no, no, no.

125
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:07,049
Come on, you guys.

126
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:10,223
You have nothing to lose.
l have everything to lose.

127
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:14,193
Do you want me to lose everything?
Everything?

128
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,463
-No.
-No.

129
00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:21,272
Okay, l'm gonna go get Frank.

130
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:26,240
We're walking down the street,
and l turn to you and say:

131
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:29,674
''Let's go hang out at
Totally Nude Nudes.'' Remember?

132
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:33,340
And then you say, ''Let's just
hang out at your place.''

133
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:36,849
Well, that was a nice move, dumb-ass.

134
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:40,256
l think you should
go out with this guy.

135
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,255
He doesn't do anything for me.

136
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,658
Last Saturday night, what happened
on Walker, Texas Ranger?

137
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:51,768
Well, Walker was looking
for this big busload of kids.

138
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:54,666
-All right, l get your point.
-All right.

139
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,204
-Hi.
-Hey.

140
00:09:56,374 --> 00:09:59,434
l forgot the combination to this
about a year ago.

141
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:02,171
l just carry it around.

142
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:05,881
-You got any Chap Stick?
- Yeah.

143
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,384
-How are those tapes working out?
-Good. l haven't smoked yet today.

144
00:10:10,655 --> 00:10:15,024
l feel great and confident.
That is a stunning blouse.

145
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:20,126
Thank you.

146
00:10:20,298 --> 00:10:21,731
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

147
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,837
Okay, Mon. Let's give Pete a chance.
He was funny. He seems really nice.

148
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:28,971
That check thing was adorable.

149
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,801
What check thing?

150
00:10:30,975 --> 00:10:36,140
As a joke, this customer who has
a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip.

151
00:10:36,314 --> 00:10:39,044
His number's on the check.
He did it so l'd call.

152
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:41,877
Pete Becker. Pete--

153
00:10:48,393 --> 00:10:49,917
ls this him?

154
00:10:50,094 --> 00:10:52,392
That's Bill Clinton.

155
00:10:53,498 --> 00:10:55,625
Who's he hugging?

156
00:10:56,834 --> 00:11:00,600
Oh, my God. That's Pete.
Why is Bill hugging Pete?

157
00:11:00,872 --> 00:11:02,567
This guy invented Moss 865.

158
00:11:02,774 --> 00:11:05,265
Every office in the world
uses that program.

159
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:07,968
-We use it!
-There you go!

160
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,576
Monica's gonna go out
with a millionaire.

161
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:15,415
-l'm not gonna go out with him.
-Why not? He's a millionaire.

162
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:22,786
Oh, my God. l can't believe this is a real
$20,000 check. This is so exciting.

163
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:26,488
-Or incredibly offensive.
-Yeah, sure. That too.

164
00:11:39,477 --> 00:11:41,001
What?

165
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:45,380
All we're saying is,
don't rush into anything.

166
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:49,680
Come on, think about it.
You're 1 8, okay? She's 44.

167
00:11:50,154 --> 00:11:54,147
When you're 36, she's gonna be 88.

168
00:11:55,493 --> 00:11:58,326
What? You don't think l know that?

169
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,655
All right, l'm gonna go play basketball.

170
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,233
Or let the really good guys
use my ball...

171
00:12:04,402 --> 00:12:06,370
...while l say, ''Can l play?''

172
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:13,769
Joe, you left your keys in the door.

173
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:15,310
Here you go.

174
00:12:23,821 --> 00:12:25,982
The point is...

175
00:12:26,157 --> 00:12:29,251
...there's a lot of women
you haven't had sex with yet.

176
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:32,496
He's right. He's right.
This is your time.

177
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,666
You're young. You're weird.
Chicks dig that.

178
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:41,168
lsn't sex better when it's with
one person that you really care about?

179
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,631
Yeah, in a poem, maybe.

180
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:48,336
No, the man's right.
That's what l had with Rachel.

181
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:54,281
-You don't have it anymore?
-No. l slept with someone else.

182
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:57,545
So wait. So how did that
make things better?

183
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:01,248
lt didn't.

184
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:05,659
What you used to have with Rachel
is what l got with Alice.

185
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,095
-Now, what is that like?
-lt's so cool, man.

186
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:13,667
lt's because being with her is so
much better than not being with her.

187
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:18,399
-Why can't l find that?
-l had it and l blew it.

188
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:21,204
-Well, l want it!
-You can have it.

189
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:23,880
Maybe there's something
wrong with me.

190
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:28,081
No, it's out there, man.
l've seen it! l got it!

191
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,611
-Then, you hold on to it!
-All right, man!

192
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:34,622
All right! Congratulations,
you lucky bastard!

193
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:36,920
You're Frank's best man?

194
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:43,125
l couldn't help it.
Their love is so pure.

195
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:45,269
What about you, huh?

196
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:47,234
l'm the ring bearer.

197
00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:09,658
l'm so glad you could come.
l've got a real home-ec emergency.

198
00:14:09,827 --> 00:14:13,024
-Oh, my God. Who died on this?
-Yeah, l know.

199
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:15,995
lt's a real ''mustard-tastrophe.''

200
00:14:16,401 --> 00:14:17,390
Can you help?

201
00:14:17,735 --> 00:14:21,933
Absolutely. First, we'll start
with a little club soda and salt.

202
00:14:22,106 --> 00:14:25,371
-Then if that doesn't work--
-Forget it. lt's ruined.

203
00:14:25,543 --> 00:14:29,104
Never say that. lf you can't
get it out, cut around the stain...

204
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,807
...add a little lace,
you make a stylish throw.

205
00:14:33,684 --> 00:14:37,677
Or instead, maybe you could just
not marry my brother Frank?

206
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:44,860
Can we make it smaller?
Make it fit on the head of a pin?

207
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:48,192
l love when we make things
fit on the head of a pin.

208
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:52,461
You have a Monica Geller here.

209
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:54,537
Absolutely. Yeah, send her in.

210
00:14:55,606 --> 00:14:56,937
Hi.

211
00:14:58,176 --> 00:14:59,734
What the hell is this?

212
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:03,113
Hang on for a sec.
l'll talk to you in the morning?

213
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:04,873
You got it.

214
00:15:05,316 --> 00:15:08,342
-l'm sorry. What?
-What is this supposed to mean?

215
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,784
Well, you know,
l never know how much to tip.

216
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:16,892
You double the tax.
Not double the tax of Romania.

217
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:22,897
Are you buying me? ls this the way
you get girls to go out with you?

218
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:26,002
I'm still here.

219
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:31,670
You're taking this wrong.
lf l didn't leave you that tip...

220
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:35,176
...you wouldn't have come,
we wouldn't have this argument...

221
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:38,474
...and there wouldn't be
this heat between us.

222
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:43,410
You gotta admit that our relationship
is hitting a new level now.

223
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:46,079
You were the chef
and l was the customer.

224
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:49,693
But now we're, like,
this couple that fights.

225
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:53,087
You're a loon.

226
00:15:53,264 --> 00:15:57,223
Look, forget the check, okay?
l like you.

227
00:15:57,468 --> 00:16:00,096
l think you're great.

228
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:01,929
Come on, what do you say?

229
00:16:04,475 --> 00:16:05,874
l don't know.

230
00:16:06,043 --> 00:16:07,806
Why not?

231
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:11,839
Because l don't wanna encourage
this kind of behavior.

232
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:16,282
One meal.
That's all l'm asking for. Please?

233
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:18,046
We go out, we eat.

234
00:16:18,222 --> 00:16:22,249
lf you don't have a good time,
l'll give you 1 0 grand, we're even.

235
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:34,463
-Hi.
-No!

236
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,767
Wait, no. Just put
the mail down. lt's me.

237
00:16:39,076 --> 00:16:42,375
Sorry. Why were you
just, like, all in the dark?

238
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:47,644
Well, your laundry smelled so good
that l thought l'd curl up in it.

239
00:16:47,818 --> 00:16:49,911
-ls that all right?
-Yeah, sure.

240
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:51,816
So how was your day?

241
00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:56,289
Well, just probably the worst one
since l've been alive.

242
00:16:58,696 --> 00:17:00,994
What happened?

243
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:04,692
Alice.... She called it off.

244
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,803
Oh, no.

245
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:11,799
Did she say why?

246
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:14,035
No. Just that l was too young.

247
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:16,975
l don't see how l could
suddenly be too young...

248
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:20,743
...because l'm older than l was
when we first got together.

249
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,686
Yeah, yeah. No. l don't--

250
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:29,724
l don't know. But you know what?
Maybe it's just all for the best.

251
00:17:29,894 --> 00:17:33,489
Well, yeah, if the best is,
like, unbelievable pain.

252
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:36,297
Oh, sweetie.

253
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:39,265
You know, l was just finally happy.

254
00:17:39,604 --> 00:17:42,505
For the first time in my life...

255
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:44,766
...after my dad left me...

256
00:17:44,942 --> 00:17:50,244
...and then getting arrested
for stealing those birds...

257
00:17:50,414 --> 00:17:54,077
...and then the whole
punctured-lung thing.

258
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:58,811
lt's still really hard to take
deep breaths in cold weather...

259
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:03,927
...but with Alice,
all that stuff kind of went away.

260
00:18:04,228 --> 00:18:09,632
And now it's gone,
and l don't know why.

261
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:15,138
Well, l can tell you why.
lt's because of me.

262
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:19,101
But you know what? l only did it
because l love you, okay?

263
00:18:21,212 --> 00:18:22,611
What?

264
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,874
l kind of had a little chat
with Alice...

265
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,247
...and l sort of made her see
why you two shouldn't be together.

266
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,787
And you'll see it too, one day.
You really, really will.

267
00:18:32,957 --> 00:18:35,448
Wait a minute.
This is because of you?

268
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,054
Okay--

269
00:18:37,228 --> 00:18:39,890
My mother didn't want us
to be together...

270
00:18:40,064 --> 00:18:44,228
...but the worst thing she ever did
was tie me to the porch.

271
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:51,533
You know, l came to you because
l thought you'd understand. Oh, no!

272
00:18:51,942 --> 00:18:53,534
You know...

273
00:18:54,145 --> 00:18:56,204
...l would storm out of here...

274
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,942
...if l had some money
or a place to go.

275
00:19:06,457 --> 00:19:09,688
Ross, if you had a million dollars,
what's the first thing you'd buy?

276
00:19:10,027 --> 00:19:13,258
l'd get some municipal bonds,
put the rest in the bank...

277
00:19:13,431 --> 00:19:14,898
...and live off the interest.

278
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:16,630
Well...

279
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:18,894
...we've heard from Dr. Fun.

280
00:19:21,405 --> 00:19:25,364
-Oh, my God! The millionaire's here!
-Oh, my God!

281
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,840
l'm just gonna have dinner with him.

282
00:19:32,016 --> 00:19:36,817
Okay, just because he buys you dinner
does not mean you owe him anything.

283
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:40,423
l know.

284
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:43,253
Okay, then get the lobster.

285
00:19:47,164 --> 00:19:48,153
-Hey.
-Hi.

286
00:19:48,332 --> 00:19:50,960
-Hi.
-Hey.

287
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:54,327
How much cash you got
in your pocket now?

288
00:19:56,941 --> 00:20:00,604
And that's why l'm not
inviting you in for a drink. Bye.

289
00:20:00,778 --> 00:20:04,179
Why not? Hey, come in for a drink.

290
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:07,142
-Where do you wanna go?
-You like pizza?

291
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:10,344
-That sounds great.
-l know a great little place.

292
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,519
You're not paying for the pizza.

293
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:22,655
Come on, it's only fair.
You paid for the flight.

294
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,800
ls that enough lira?

295
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:27,028
l'd throw another 1 000 on that.

296
00:20:27,204 --> 00:20:29,604
-How much is that?
-That's about 60 cents.

297
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:43,782
Every night!

298
00:20:44,922 --> 00:20:47,117
You don't need to smoke.

299
00:20:47,324 --> 00:20:49,986
Cigarettes don't control you.

300
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:53,995
You are a strong, confident woman...

301
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:56,759
...who does not need to smoke.

302
00:20:56,934 --> 00:21:00,165
A strong, confident woman...

303
00:21:00,337 --> 00:21:02,897
...who does not need to smoke.

304
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,872
So can I.

305
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:19,746
Hey, Frank.

306
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:24,492
Look, l know that you think l did
this totally evil thing.

307
00:21:24,662 --> 00:21:26,186
But l so didn't.

308
00:21:27,331 --> 00:21:31,734
There's someone here who can
explain this better than l can.

309
00:21:35,806 --> 00:21:37,433
Hi, Frank.

310
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:44,102
Hi, Mrs. Knight.

311
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:49,213
Phoebe's right, Frank.

312
00:21:49,386 --> 00:21:53,083
lt's hard to hear, but it would've
been wrong to go through with it.

313
00:21:53,257 --> 00:21:54,986
l was being selfish.

314
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:58,492
Even though we want
the same things right now...

315
00:21:58,662 --> 00:22:03,031
...in the future, we may not.

316
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,896
-ls that what it is?
-Yes, but not just that.

317
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,264
Not just that.

318
00:22:10,908 --> 00:22:16,744
Even though we love each other
as much as we do...

319
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:18,404
...nonetheless....

320
00:22:20,784 --> 00:22:23,548
-Nonetheless.
-Nonetheless.

321
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:30,251
You're too young...

322
00:22:30,427 --> 00:22:33,794
...to really know what you want.

323
00:22:33,964 --> 00:22:36,694
That's right, exactly.

324
00:22:38,335 --> 00:22:41,634
All right, that's a goodbye kiss.
That's good.

325
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,867
Bye-bye.

326
00:22:45,242 --> 00:22:50,043
But no, the important thing is,
is that you see what l'm saying.

327
00:22:50,214 --> 00:22:52,910
This is clearly wrong.

328
00:22:53,984 --> 00:22:56,509
l've decided l'm gonna
let this happen.

329
00:22:57,254 --> 00:23:00,280
Okay, can l just get my purse?
l'm sorry.

330
00:23:00,457 --> 00:23:03,255
Okay, all right, good.

331
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:08,931
Cigarettes don't control you.

332
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:12,159
You are a strong, confident woman...

333
00:23:12,336 --> 00:23:15,897
...who does not need to smoke.

334
00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:20,574
Joey's your best friend.
