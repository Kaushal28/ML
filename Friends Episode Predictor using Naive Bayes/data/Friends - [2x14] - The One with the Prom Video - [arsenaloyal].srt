1
00:00:07,737 --> 00:00:08,795
Hold on a second.

2
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:13,906
Nice.

3
00:00:15,378 --> 00:00:16,675
I got you something.

4
00:00:16,913 --> 00:00:17,811
What's this?

5
00:00:18,014 --> 00:00:19,743
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.

6
00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:22,843
Didn't Big Leon tell you?
It's a thousand...

7
00:00:23,052 --> 00:00:24,986
...to have me for the whole night.

8
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:26,685
What's this for?

9
00:00:26,889 --> 00:00:29,050
Well, I'm making money now.

10
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:34,161
I'm paying you back for headshots,
electric bills, all that pizza....

11
00:00:34,363 --> 00:00:35,227
I love you, man.

12
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:38,662
Well, thanks, man.
Now I can get my pony.

13
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:42,530
This is a little extra something for...

14
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:44,502
...always being there for me.

15
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:47,171
Wow, I don't know what to say.

16
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,448
Wow, I don't know what to say.

17
00:00:56,919 --> 00:00:57,886
What do you say?

18
00:00:58,087 --> 00:00:59,384
I don't know.

19
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,348
It's a bracelet.

20
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,618
Isn't it? It's engraved, too.
Check it out.

21
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:07,790
"To my best bud."

22
00:01:13,035 --> 00:01:14,127
Thanks, best bud.

23
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:16,271
Put it on.

24
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:17,528
Now?

25
00:01:20,243 --> 00:01:23,007
No, it should be saved
for a special occasion.

26
00:01:23,212 --> 00:01:26,147
No, that's the beauty part.
It goes with everything.

27
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:29,374
When you put this on,
you're good to go.

28
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:36,374
I'm never being good to go, so why don't try some jewrel.

29
00:01:38,923 --> 00:01:40,390
Oh, man!

30
00:01:40,825 --> 00:01:43,487
You are so wearing that bracelet!

31
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,057
I so am!

32
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:49,798
Any idea what this will
do for your sex life?

33
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:51,764
It might slow down at first, but...

34
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,167
...once I'm used to the extra weight,
I'll be back on track.

35
00:01:56,174 --> 00:01:58,165
The One With the Prom Video

36
00:02:43,089 --> 00:02:45,080
-This all looks good.
-Great.

37
00:02:45,358 --> 00:02:48,486
If I want to call for a reference
on your last job...?

38
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:51,857
That's right there, see?
The manager, Chandler Bing?

39
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:53,424
All right.

40
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:57,659
Let's see if you're as good in person
as you are on paper. Make me a salad.

41
00:02:58,003 --> 00:03:01,166
A salad? I could do
something more complicated.

42
00:03:01,374 --> 00:03:04,172
No, just the salad will be fine.

43
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:05,942
You got it.

44
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:10,946
Now I want you to tell me what
you're doing while you're doing it.

45
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:15,484
All right. Well,
I'm tearing the lettuce.

46
00:03:15,888 --> 00:03:16,718
Is it dirty?

47
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:18,389
Oh, I'm gonna wash it.

48
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:20,854
Don't. I like it dirty.

49
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:25,052
That's your call.

50
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:28,390
So, what are you going to do next?

51
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:31,135
I thought that l'd
cut up the tomatoes.

52
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,668
Are they firm?

53
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:36,839
They're all right.

54
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:38,976
You sure they haven't gone bad?

55
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:41,839
You sure they're not very, very bad?

56
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:47,151
No, really, they're okay.

57
00:03:47,486 --> 00:03:49,647
You gonna slice them up real nice?

58
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,754
I was going to do them julienne.

59
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,922
I'm out of here!

60
00:04:04,503 --> 00:04:05,527
Hello?

61
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:09,030
Rachel's not here.
Can I take a message?

62
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:11,774
How do we spell Casey?

63
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,104
Is it like "at the bat"
or "and The Sunshine Band"?

64
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:20,742
Hey, who's this Casey?

65
00:04:20,986 --> 00:04:22,578
Some guy she met at the movies.

66
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:24,584
What does he want with her?

67
00:04:24,823 --> 00:04:26,916
I guess he wants to
do a little dance...

68
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:31,224
...you know, make a little love....

69
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,656
Well, pretty much get down tonight.

70
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,371
I don't know. I don't

71
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:47,204
I don't get it! Two months ago,
Rachel and I were this close.

72
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,848
Now I'm taking messages from guys
she meets at the movies?

73
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:55,008
I mean, this Casey should be
taking down my messages, you know?

74
00:04:55,854 --> 00:04:58,220
Or Rachel and I should be together...

75
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,449
...and we should get
some kind of message service.

76
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,062
Hang in there.
It's gonna happen.

77
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:05,730
Now, how do you know that?

78
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,729
Because she's your lobster.

79
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:12,526
Oh, she's going somewhere.

80
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:19,142
It's a known fact that lobsters
fall in love and mate for life.

81
00:05:19,378 --> 00:05:23,474
You know what? You can actually
see old lobster couples...

82
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:27,446
...walking around their tank,
holding claws, like....

83
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,648
Hey, you feeling better?

84
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:41,225
Yeah, I think that fifth shower
got the interview off me.

85
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:43,964
Do you have other possibilities?

86
00:05:44,165 --> 00:05:47,430
There is the possibility
that I won't make rent.

87
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:49,403
If you want,
I can lend you money.

88
00:05:49,537 --> 00:05:54,474
If I couldn't pay you back right away,
I'd feel guilty and tense around you.

89
00:05:55,377 --> 00:05:57,777
Then why not borrow it
from Mom and Dad?

90
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:00,812
You feel guilty and tense
around them already.

91
00:06:01,082 --> 00:06:03,573
Might as well
make some money off of them.

92
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:05,948
The man's got a point.

93
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,323
What is that sparkly thing?

94
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,558
That thing?

95
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:16,422
Yeah, it's a little flashy.

96
00:06:17,565 --> 00:06:18,463
No, no.

97
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,395
No, no. It's not flashy.
Not for a goodfella.

98
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,404
Man, that is sharp! That must
have cost you quite a few doubloons.

99
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:41,683
Hi, darling.

100
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:42,885
What's this?

101
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:44,519
Some of your old stuff.

102
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:48,155
Well, sweetie,
we have a surprise for you.

103
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:50,382
We're turning your room into a gym.

104
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:54,555
Wow, that is a surprise!

105
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:57,232
Just one question.
Why not Ross's room?

106
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,865
We talked about that...

107
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:03,767
... but your brother had so many
science trophies, plaques, merit badges....

108
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,871
We didn't want to disturb them.

109
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:07,508
God forbid!

110
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:11,908
What's with you. What can you tell us.
How is your job.

111
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:13,908
My job, well!

112
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,508
Do I mention that I still don't have a boyfriend.

113
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:20,508
I just assume

114
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,283
We were so sorry to hear
about your parents splitting up.

115
00:07:31,487 --> 00:07:35,287
Well, they're just separated.
You never know! We'll see.

116
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:37,652
I can't say any of us
were surprised.

117
00:07:39,728 --> 00:07:42,993
They've been unhappy
ever since we've known them.

118
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:45,723
Especially after
that incident in Hawaii.

119
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:49,667
What? What incident?

120
00:07:49,905 --> 00:07:53,102
No, no. I must be
thinking of someone else.

121
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:54,934
Maybe me!

122
00:07:55,144 --> 00:07:57,339
Don't you have some folding to do?

123
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,104
Fold. You fold.

124
00:08:02,952 --> 00:08:05,785
-Want a refill?
-I'm all right, thanks.

125
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,425
Give me a second.
I want to get this just right.

126
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:19,364
Dude, eleven o'clock,
totally hot babe checking you out.

127
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:26,030
That was really good.
I think I'm ready for my penis now.

128
00:08:34,183 --> 00:08:37,880
I know what you're thinking.
Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.

129
00:08:38,988 --> 00:08:39,852
I'm Gail.

130
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:46,556
I really have to be somewhere,
but it was nice meeting you.

131
00:08:55,204 --> 00:08:56,034
Excellent!

132
00:08:56,238 --> 00:08:59,401
He could have gotten me a VCR
or a set of golf clubs.

133
00:08:59,642 --> 00:09:02,076
But no! He got me
the "woman repeller"!

134
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:06,241
The eyesore from
the Liberace House of Crap!

135
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:08,541
-It's not bad.
-Easy for you to say.

136
00:09:08,817 --> 00:09:11,877
You're not sporting a reject
from the Mr. Tcollection!

137
00:09:13,522 --> 00:09:17,049
"l pity the fool that
puts on my jewelry! I do! I do!"

138
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:18,226
"l pity that fool"

139
00:09:20,996 --> 00:09:24,227
Hey, man! We were just
doing some impressions.

140
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:25,900
Do your Marcel Marceau.

141
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,667
That's actually good.

142
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,241
Would you look at that guy?

143
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:42,383
How long has he
been talking to her?

144
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,184
I don't know. A couple of minutes.

145
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,984
Yeah, try doubling that.

146
00:09:46,984 --> 00:09:51,148
It's like, back off, buddy!
She's a waitress, not a geisha.

147
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,489
I think she's okay.

148
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:55,956
Look at that!

149
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,424
She pushes him away
and he won't budge!

150
00:09:58,663 --> 00:10:00,528
I'm gonna do something.

151
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,766
We'll get a condo...

152
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:06,835
... right on the mountain.
Ski in, ski out, it's great.

153
00:10:07,638 --> 00:10:09,833
Excuse me? Are you Rachel?

154
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:11,330
What?

155
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:13,643
Ross Geller.

156
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:17,644
God, in your ad you said
you were pretty, but wow!

157
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,681
What are you doing?

158
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:23,718
Oh, my God, is this the wrong day?

159
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:26,354
I don't believe it!

160
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:29,388
If it works out, we'll have
something to tell the grandkids!

161
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:30,956
You sure will.

162
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:32,890
I've gotta go.

163
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:34,962
Take care.

164
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,332
See you later.

165
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:41,233
You're welcome.

166
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,372
-What?
-I was saving you.

167
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:49,307
Saving me from a pleasant
conversation with an interesting man?

168
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:50,572
From where I was

169
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:52,338
Okay, Ross, listen to me.

170
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,211
I am not yours to save.

171
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:57,086
But you are.

172
00:10:57,321 --> 00:10:58,151
What?

173
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,887
You're my lobster.

174
00:11:04,762 --> 00:11:07,595
Are you being
the blind-date guy again?

175
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:11,663
No, you're my lobster.

176
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:14,338
Lobsters....

177
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,874
In the tank, when they're old...

178
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,903
...they get with the
They walk around holding the claws.

179
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:26,273
In the tank!
You know, with...

180
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:29,181
...with the holding and....

181
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,287
Pheebs, you wanna help me
with the lobster thing?

182
00:11:32,523 --> 00:11:34,388
Do the claws again.

183
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:38,520
Rach, forget the lobsters, okay?

184
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:40,559
Let's talk
What about us?

185
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:44,030
Ross, there is no "us," okay?

186
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:46,694
No! Listen to me!

187
00:11:46,904 --> 00:11:49,134
I fell for you and I get clobbered.

188
00:11:49,673 --> 00:11:52,574
You then fall for me
and I again get clobbered.

189
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:56,440
I'm tired of being
clobbered, you know?

190
00:11:56,714 --> 00:11:58,238
It's just not worth it.

191
00:11:58,516 --> 00:11:59,710
Well, but

192
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:01,782
No "but," Ross.

193
00:12:02,052 --> 00:12:05,920
We are never gonna happen, okay?
Accept that.

194
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:09,090
Except that what?

195
00:12:11,595 --> 00:12:13,688
No. No.

196
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:17,594
Accept that.

197
00:12:37,077 --> 00:12:40,604
Hey, man! Look, it's my best bud!
How you doing?

198
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:45,149
You're getting good at that
Marcel Marceau thing.

199
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:50,449
What do you say we play some ball?
You and me, huh?

200
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:54,919
Okay, that's my bad.

201
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,761
If you hated the bracelet,
you should have just said so.

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,968
Doesn't the fact that I wore it...

203
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:05,104
...say how much
our friendship means to me?

204
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:09,174
But you insulted the bracelet
and you made fun of me.

205
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:12,473
Well, that's the part
where I'm a wank.

206
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,544
I was hoping you
wouldn't focus on that.

207
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:18,944
I am focus on this.

208
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:24,544
How we argue that

209
00:13:26,117 --> 00:13:29,052
Come on, man! I said I was
sorry a hundred times.

210
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,720
I promise, I will never
take it off my...

211
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:33,713
...wrist.

212
00:13:37,161 --> 00:13:39,789
But if you want to
stay in there and be mad...

213
00:13:39,997 --> 00:13:41,988
...you just, you stay in there.

214
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,857
You know what the

215
00:13:44,635 --> 00:13:46,125
I am here, on my knees...

216
00:13:48,206 --> 00:13:50,697
... holding up these couch cushions...

217
00:13:50,908 --> 00:13:53,638
...as a symbol
of my sorrow and regret.

218
00:13:54,912 --> 00:13:58,040
Much like they did
in biblical times.

219
00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:00,149
Though you may haveth anger now....

220
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:05,549
You are gonna grab something, aren't you.

221
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,050
You know, that Steffi Graf
has quite a tush.

222
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:17,519
I'm just saying!
It's right there!

223
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:19,228
Hey, guys.

224
00:14:19,432 --> 00:14:20,899
Hi, darling.

225
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:23,765
Where is my grandson, You didn't bring him?

226
00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:26,904
He's at Carol and Susan's today.

227
00:14:27,106 --> 00:14:29,370
A woman in my office is a lesbian.

228
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,541
I'm just saying!

229
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:38,015
Jack, look! There's that house
paint commercial that cracks you up!

230
00:14:43,022 --> 00:14:45,183
-Where have you been?
-Emotional hell.

231
00:14:45,424 --> 00:14:46,948
Did they lend you the money?

232
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:49,023
No, I haven't asked them yet.

233
00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:50,889
Come on, Monica, do it.

234
00:14:51,096 --> 00:14:52,529
Hey, you guys.

235
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:54,859
Monica has some news.

236
00:14:56,201 --> 00:15:00,365
So listen, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you this before, but...

237
00:15:01,373 --> 00:15:05,104
... I'm no longer at my job.
I had to leave it.

238
00:15:05,311 --> 00:15:06,209
Why?

239
00:15:06,712 --> 00:15:08,577
Because they made me.

240
00:15:09,815 --> 00:15:13,717
You were fired?
What are you gonna do?

241
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,219
Judy, relax. This is our little
Harmonica we're talking about.

242
00:15:18,457 --> 00:15:19,651
We taught her well.

243
00:15:19,892 --> 00:15:24,056
-Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
-ln the bank.

244
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:27,991
So she dips into her savings.
That's what it's there for.

245
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,599
She's gonna be fine. Aren't you sweetie.

246
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:34,866
If you need a little extra...

247
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,231
...you know where to find it.

248
00:15:37,473 --> 00:15:39,498
Anything larger back there?

249
00:15:41,343 --> 00:15:42,867
I can't believe it!

250
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:44,669
Would you stop already?

251
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,872
Get out of the bitter barn
and play in the hay.

252
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,574
Oh, you're right.
I should play in the hay.

253
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:55,085
I just dropped $400 to replace
a bracelet I hated to begin with.

254
00:15:55,324 --> 00:15:57,053
Bring on the hay!

255
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,690
Hey!

256
00:16:01,063 --> 00:16:03,429
I've got something
that'll make you happy.

257
00:16:03,665 --> 00:16:05,394
Guess what Gunther found?

258
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:09,503
Hey, now you have two!

259
00:16:11,707 --> 00:16:13,004
Oh, now you have two.

260
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:17,705
What am I gonna do?

261
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:25,212
How come you have two?

262
00:16:26,922 --> 00:16:28,048
This one's for you.

263
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,121
Get out!

264
00:16:30,392 --> 00:16:31,859
No, I can't.

265
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:36,526
I know how much this means to you...

266
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:38,962
...and this is about more than jewelry.

267
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:42,728
It's about you and me
and the fact that we're "best buds."

268
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:47,773
Is this friendship?
I think so!

269
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:51,905
Check it out!
We're bracelet buddies!

270
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:54,574
That's what they'll call us!

271
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:59,778
Okay, here you go.
Pay me back whenever you like.

272
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:02,117
You have dinosaur checks?

273
00:17:03,992 --> 00:17:06,688
You get your money
and you learn something.

274
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,157
What's wrong with that?

275
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:09,625
Nothing.

276
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:12,492
Hey, you're a cheap-a-saurus!

277
00:17:14,636 --> 00:17:18,003
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Thank you, I'm very grateful.

278
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,673
Hey, Mon, what is this?

279
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:26,137
That's my bathing suit from high school.
I was a little bigger then.

280
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,852
I thought they used that
to cover Connecticut when it rains.

281
00:17:32,354 --> 00:17:34,254
Hey, what's on this videotape?

282
00:17:34,456 --> 00:17:36,117
I don't know.
Let's put it in.

283
00:17:46,168 --> 00:17:48,432
Over here, Jack. Okay.

284
00:17:48,637 --> 00:17:50,764
Rachel's coming up the path.

285
00:17:50,973 --> 00:17:53,134
Doesn't she look pretty? Jack?

286
00:17:53,342 --> 00:17:54,502
Can you get this?

287
00:17:57,513 --> 00:17:59,037
Oh, my God!

288
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:01,205
What is with your nose?

289
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:07,686
They had to reduce it
because of my deviated septum.

290
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:11,959
Okay, I was wrong. That's
what they use to cover Connecticut.

291
00:18:12,828 --> 00:18:14,989
This is us getting ready
for the prom.

292
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:17,865
We don't have to watch.

293
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:18,896
Yeah, we do.

294
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:20,533
-Come on!
-It's fun!

295
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:22,167
Get a shot of Monica.

296
00:18:22,404 --> 00:18:23,234
Where's Monica?

297
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:24,870
Over here, Dad!

298
00:18:25,841 --> 00:18:28,002
Wait. How do you zoom out?

299
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:31,738
There she is!

300
00:18:35,217 --> 00:18:36,980
Some girl ate Monica!

301
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:42,190
Shut up!
The camera adds ten pounds.

302
00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:44,982
So how many cameras
are actually on you?

303
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,164
Oh, you look so great!

304
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:53,163
So do you! You look beautiful!

305
00:18:53,936 --> 00:18:54,925
-Oops.
- What?

306
00:18:55,237 --> 00:18:57,102
I think I got mayonnaise on you.

307
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:59,830
Oh, it's just the shoulder,
not my dress.

308
00:19:02,678 --> 00:19:03,940
Everybody smile!

309
00:19:04,713 --> 00:19:06,203
Oh, Dad, turn it off!

310
00:19:06,448 --> 00:19:07,278
It is off.

311
00:19:07,482 --> 00:19:09,746
It is not!
What's with the red light?

312
00:19:09,952 --> 00:19:11,544
It's the off light.

313
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:13,254
Right, Ross?

314
00:19:21,296 --> 00:19:23,423
Looking good, Mr. IKotter.

315
00:19:27,603 --> 00:19:30,367
- You look pretty tonight.
-Oh, thanks.

316
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,640
- What are you doing this summer?
-I'm gonna hang out...

317
00:19:36,912 --> 00:19:38,903
... work on my music.

318
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:45,782
Is my hook unhooked?
These things keep falling down.

319
00:19:52,628 --> 00:19:54,653
Let me see. I don't know.

320
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:56,496
What are you gonna do...

321
00:19:56,765 --> 00:19:58,562
The guys are here!

322
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,926
... this summer?

323
00:20:00,135 --> 00:20:01,227
Work on your music?

324
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:09,076
Oh, my God!
There's Roy Gublik!

325
00:20:09,745 --> 00:20:13,511
You know, Roy saw
Star Wars 317 times.

326
00:20:13,815 --> 00:20:14,975
He was in the paper.

327
00:20:16,952 --> 00:20:19,785
Where's Chip?
Why isn't he here yet?

328
00:20:19,988 --> 00:20:22,752
He'll be here, okay?
Take a chill pill.

329
00:20:24,126 --> 00:20:25,184
There.

330
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:33,760
I just told Rachel
that Roy touched my boob.

331
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:41,203
I can't go to the prom without a date.
I can't! It's too late!

332
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:44,375
If you're not going,
then I don't want to go.

333
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:47,136
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass!

334
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,976
I have a wonderful idea.

335
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:53,949
You should take Rachel to the prom.

336
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:55,986
Doubtful.

337
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:59,124
Jack, give me that.
Talk to your son.

338
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:02,890
All right, go on.
This thing's heavy.

339
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,691
Your mother's right.
Take her. You can wear my tux.

340
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:08,368
She won't wanna go with me.

341
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:11,537
Of course she would!
You're a college man!

342
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:14,004
-I don't know.
- Well, come on.

343
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:16,038
Don't you wanna find out?

344
00:21:17,478 --> 00:21:19,742
I can't believe
I can't go to the prom!

345
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,504
This is so harsh!

346
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:29,145
-Hold my board.
- Thataboy! Thataboy!

347
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,217
I think we've seen enough.

348
00:21:31,425 --> 00:21:32,517
Let's turn it off.

349
00:21:33,761 --> 00:21:35,422
Well, I'm not gonna watch.

350
00:21:36,497 --> 00:21:38,158
Come on, kid. Let's go!

351
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:44,030
-My! Are you handsome!
-Let's show them!

352
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:45,932
Just a sec, Dad.

353
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:49,398
Okay, be cool. Just be cool.

354
00:21:59,253 --> 00:22:00,083
Okay, Dad.

355
00:22:00,354 --> 00:22:04,222
Rachel, ready or not,
here comes your knight in shining

356
00:22:04,425 --> 00:22:05,687
Oh, no.

357
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:07,856
Don't wait up!

358
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:09,422
Chip!

359
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:12,755
Oh, dear!

360
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:15,228
How do I turn this off?

361
00:22:15,636 --> 00:22:16,762
Press the button.

362
00:22:16,971 --> 00:22:18,905
Which one? Which button? Jack!

363
00:22:19,106 --> 00:22:20,733
The button! The button!

364
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:26,940
I can't believe you did that.

365
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:31,542
Yeah, well....

366
00:23:00,181 --> 00:23:02,513
See? He's her lobster!

367
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:12,621
Dance with him!

368
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,626
Mom, I'm hungry!

369
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,823
Dance with your father.

370
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:21,364
I don't know any of your flashdances,
but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.

371
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:22,829
All right.

372
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,643
-Oh, Jack!
-Oh, Judy!
