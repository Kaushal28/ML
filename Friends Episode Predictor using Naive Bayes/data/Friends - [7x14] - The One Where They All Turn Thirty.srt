1
00:00:05,117 --> 00:00:06,277
Happy birthday!

2
00:00:06,485 --> 00:00:07,679
Happy birthday!

3
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:12,316
Rach, come on.

4
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:13,947
It's your birthday!

5
00:00:14,793 --> 00:00:15,817
Hey....

6
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:20,626
She's not as pretty as
she was when she was 29.

7
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:26,497
Ms. Green wants to estabIish some
ground ruIes before she comes out.

8
00:00:26,705 --> 00:00:30,072
She'd appreciate it if you didn't use
the words ''oId'' or ''downhiII'' ...

9
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:32,800
...or ''They stiII Iook
pretty damn good.''

10
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:38,109
They do.

11
00:00:39,384 --> 00:00:41,181
RacheI, come on out.

12
00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:43,314
Monica made breakfast.

13
00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:44,955
ChocoIate chip pancakes.

14
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,357
We've got presents.

15
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:51,828
Good ones?

16
00:00:52,397 --> 00:00:55,764
They aII came from the Iist
you handed out to us two weeks ago.

17
00:00:56,368 --> 00:00:59,394
Can I keep the presents
and stiII be 29?

18
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:03,875
Come on, Rach, turning 30
is not that big a deaI.

19
00:01:04,242 --> 00:01:07,040
ReaIIy? Is that how you feIt
when you turned 30?

20
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:09,270
Why, God, why?

21
00:01:09,948 --> 00:01:13,475
We had a deaI.
Let the others grow oId, not me!

22
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:26,227
You know, I'm stiII 29 in Guam.

23
00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:29,892
Hey, 30 is not that oId.

24
00:01:30,068 --> 00:01:32,832
Do you know how oId the Earth is?

25
00:01:34,573 --> 00:01:36,040
Late 30s?

26
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:40,004
You guys, is it just me?
Am I overreacting?

27
00:01:40,212 --> 00:01:44,876
No, it's not just you.
My 30th birthday sure wasn't much fun.

28
00:01:45,617 --> 00:01:47,141
And now ChandIer!

29
00:01:49,154 --> 00:01:51,054
We're aII getting so oId.

30
00:01:51,256 --> 00:01:53,816
Why are you doing this to us?

31
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,157
The One Where They AII Turn Thirty

32
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,130
You're in a great pIace in your Iife.
You have an amazing job, good friends.

33
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:42,364
Your roommate's a soap opera star.

34
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:44,471
Your character is in a coma.

35
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:49,680
I promised myseIf
I wasn't gonna cry at this one.

36
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:54,810
I know my Iife's going pretty weII,
but I see so many peopIe...

37
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:58,454
...who've accompIished their goaIs
before they're 30.

38
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:01,490
Yeah, but you shouIdn't compare
yourseIf to me.

39
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:04,892
-Come on, Phoebe!
-You can do it!

40
00:03:05,864 --> 00:03:07,354
-Come on.
-There you go.

41
00:03:13,872 --> 00:03:17,103
I did it!
One miIe on a Hippity Hop.

42
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:20,906
That's everything I wanted to do
before I was 30.

43
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:24,012
E<i>x</i>cept I wanted to
patch things up with my sister.

44
00:03:24,249 --> 00:03:25,409
Oh, weII. But, yeah!

45
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:31,082
GirIs, this thing is a godsend,
if you know what I mean.

46
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,294
Thirty. Oh, I mean, 30.

47
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:48,496
Monica, you remember mean, oId
Mrs. Kreiger in fifth grade? She was 30.

48
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,768
Let's have some fun.
What do you want to do?

49
00:03:52,944 --> 00:03:54,707
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.

50
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:59,873
Doing nothing on your 30th is better
than doing something stupid, Iike Ross.

51
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:02,947
That was a practicaI purchase.

52
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:05,918
I needed that car for transportation.

53
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:08,557
Okay? I have a chiId.

54
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:11,288
How hot do I Iook in this?

55
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:14,655
Ross, a sports car?

56
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:18,199
WouIdn't it be cheaper
to just stuff a sock down there?

57
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,129
That's not what this is about.

58
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:23,637
I am a sports car enthusiast.

59
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,572
-I've aIways been into cars.
-What's the horsepower?

60
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,377
I don't know, but Iook how shiny!

61
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:38,086
-I can't beIieve you bought this.
-ReaIIy. God, Ross, what were you thinking?

62
00:04:38,256 --> 00:04:41,157
I know it's reaIIy shaIIow,
but part of me wants him again.

63
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:44,056
WeII, get in Iine, missy.

64
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:46,424
So can I have a ride, stud?

65
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:48,096
Hop in.

66
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:53,063
Get ready for the
smoothest ride of your Iife.

67
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:18,760
Damn it.

68
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:22,495
Okay, who's ne<i>x</i>t?

69
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:29,897
I am gonna do something today. I'm
not just gonna sit around Iike some oId Iady.

70
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:32,474
I want to get something pierced.

71
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:36,010
Like my nose or my tongue or something.

72
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:37,943
ReaIIy? Because that hurts.

73
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,013
So what?
The way I see it--

74
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:41,719
Son of a bitch!

75
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:46,283
Look, I know what
you're going through.

76
00:05:46,491 --> 00:05:49,756
I'm totaIIy freaked out
about turning 25.

77
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:55,096
Get out of my apartment.

78
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:58,592
Rach, I think that you're doing great.

79
00:05:58,837 --> 00:06:01,635
Let's face it,
no one handIes this weII.

80
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:03,770
Least of aII you.

81
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:08,473
-Why, what did you do?
-Weren't you asked to Ieave, sonny?

82
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,181
Put that back on.
Monica wiII be here any minute.

83
00:06:17,422 --> 00:06:19,583
But it hurts my Joey's appIe.

84
00:06:22,093 --> 00:06:26,826
For the Iast time, it's not named
after each individuaI man.

85
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:34,529
You've done a wonderfuI job with
this party, ChandIer. Everything's so IoveIy.

86
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:36,297
WeII, not as IoveIy as you.

87
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,999
I can't beIieve you have a
30-year-oId daughter.

88
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:44,045
And I can't beIieve you have
a tu<i>x</i> that's 30 years oId.

89
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:49,444
It's oIder than that. Ross was actuaIIy
conceived right near this tu<i>x</i>edo.

90
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:54,548
Everybody hide! I saw her.
She's coming.

91
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:57,324
Everybody down!

92
00:06:58,163 --> 00:06:59,755
Crap.

93
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:08,430
Everybody stay here.
I'II find out what's going on.

94
00:07:10,475 --> 00:07:13,273
Hey, you got the door open!

95
00:07:15,046 --> 00:07:17,241
Hey, are you drunk?

96
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:18,675
No.

97
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:22,179
Okay.

98
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,823
Okay.

99
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,593
See, I was a IittIe nervous
about turning...

100
00:07:32,864 --> 00:07:34,229
...30.

101
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,228
So the busboys took me out
for some drinks.

102
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,067
Might want to puke on you Iater.

103
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,547
Here's the thing. We've thrown
a very formaI surprise party for you.

104
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:53,650
-Your friends are in there, and your parents.
-No!

105
00:07:53,885 --> 00:07:54,909
-Yes! Yes!
-No.

106
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,351
Oh, no! My parents have never
seen me drunk.

107
00:07:58,757 --> 00:08:00,088
That they know of.

108
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:05,257
We'II get you some coffee.
They'II never know that you're drunk.

109
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:07,954
-You promise?
-I'II take care of it.

110
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,225
I Iove you so much.

111
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:14,504
Okay, we have to do something
about your breath.

112
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,806
What about your breath?

113
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:20,902
That's stiII yours.

114
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:25,514
Now remember,
it's a surprise party.

115
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,082
So when you go in, act surprised.

116
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:30,647
Ready?

117
00:08:37,962 --> 00:08:39,259
Surprise!

118
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,131
Okay, forward. Forward.

119
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:48,498
Stop!

120
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,633
Okay, back-- Stop!

121
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:54,976
Okay, for-- Stop!

122
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,772
Stop! Stop!

123
00:08:57,248 --> 00:09:00,217
Ross, just forget about it.
The guy's got you totaIIy wedged in.

124
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,450
-Is this yours?
-No, it's mine! It's mine.

125
00:09:07,992 --> 00:09:10,654
Dude, you so need this car.

126
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:15,061
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

127
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,063
I'II break into this minivan,
put it in neutraI.

128
00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:21,101
You push it forward
so Ross can drive out of the spot.

129
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:24,204
AII right. Here we go.

130
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:31,710
HauI ass!

131
00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:45,885
Happy 30th birthday! Here.

132
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:49,966
It's for the chiId in you.
And the woman.

133
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:51,929
Happy 30th!

134
00:09:52,137 --> 00:09:53,934
Right. Why do you keep saying that?

135
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:56,604
Because it's our 30th birthday.

136
00:09:56,841 --> 00:10:00,208
Yeah, no, we're not 30.
We're 31 . Okay.

137
00:10:01,045 --> 00:10:02,410
Wait.

138
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:06,041
Oh, it's you.

139
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:07,946
Yeah. What?

140
00:10:08,153 --> 00:10:10,212
Yeah, we're not 30. We're 31 .

141
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,381
That's what it says
on my birth certificate.

142
00:10:14,592 --> 00:10:16,150
You have a birth certificate?

143
00:10:16,427 --> 00:10:19,294
I got a big bo<i>x</i> of famiIy stuff
when my mom died.

144
00:10:19,964 --> 00:10:21,261
Our mom.

145
00:10:21,432 --> 00:10:22,626
Right. Okay.

146
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:28,463
-Do you have mine?
-No, I soId it to a Swedish runaway.

147
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:32,641
Oh, my God.

148
00:10:33,578 --> 00:10:35,671
Oh, my God, we are 31 !

149
00:10:35,947 --> 00:10:37,437
Yeah.

150
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:41,282
I just Iost a whoIe year of my Iife.

151
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,781
Okay.

152
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:46,780
-Your middIe name is PameIa?
-Yes.

153
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:50,017
I never knew mine.
Do you remember what it is?

154
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:52,388
Yes. Phoebe.

155
00:10:53,631 --> 00:10:57,431
-That's my first name.
-Right. Okay. Then, no.

156
00:11:01,172 --> 00:11:04,039
We made it across the room.
You're doing great.

157
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:05,533
What's going on?

158
00:11:05,777 --> 00:11:07,335
Monica's a IittIe drunk.

159
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:09,670
Yeah! I Iove drunk Monica.

160
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:14,447
Oh, she's so much more fun
than reguIar Monica.

161
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:19,782
She doesn't want her parents to know.

162
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:23,350
AII right, aII right.
Here's what we'II do.

163
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:27,520
I'II get twice as drunk,
then no one wiII even notice her.

164
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,296
-Drunk Phoebe's mean.
-Okay, you watch your tone with me!

165
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:39,108
What's going on?

166
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:41,238
Monica's wasted.

167
00:11:41,446 --> 00:11:44,040
Maybe that wiII Iiven up this party.

168
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:47,115
WiII you just heIp her get changed?

169
00:11:47,452 --> 00:11:50,785
Taking care of a drunk, naked woman
seems Iike a job for Joey.

170
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:57,727
This one's from me.

171
00:11:57,962 --> 00:12:00,590
It wasn't on your Iist,
but it's reaIIy fun.

172
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,994
A scooter.

173
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,931
Stick to the Iist.

174
00:12:09,574 --> 00:12:12,634
AIways stick to the Iist.

175
00:12:13,344 --> 00:12:15,778
No, no, I Iove it. Thank you.

176
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:18,772
Open ours ne<i>x</i>t! Open ours ne<i>x</i>t!

177
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:21,474
Now that you're a coupIe,
we don't get two gifts?

178
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:24,813
For my Iast birthday,
you gave me a hug.

179
00:12:25,723 --> 00:12:27,816
Read the card! Read the card!

180
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:33,961
''Happy birthday, Grandma.

181
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:38,963
It's better to be over the hiII...

182
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:41,764
...than buried under it.

183
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:47,936
AII our Iove, Monica and ChandIer.''
That's funny.

184
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:50,545
No, no. That was a joke.

185
00:12:50,782 --> 00:12:53,546
I know, I get it. It's funny.

186
00:12:53,785 --> 00:12:55,753
Because you're not a grandma.

187
00:12:55,953 --> 00:12:59,480
To be a grandma, you have to
be married and have chiIdren.

188
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:04,185
I don't have any of those things.
That's why it's so funny.

189
00:13:04,796 --> 00:13:06,195
I'm just gonna go....

190
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:13,566
AII you had to do was buy the card.

191
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,402
Hey, Iook who's back.
It's the birthday girI.

192
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,344
How's the birthday girI feeIing?

193
00:13:27,318 --> 00:13:30,810
WeII, I feeI fine, but I think
you're bumming out the rest of the kids.

194
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:38,685
It was stupid to get upset about
not having a husband and kids.

195
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,194
AII I reaIIy needed was a pIan.

196
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,395
See, I want three kids.

197
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:48,662
And you want to have them aII at the
same time and have them for your brother.

198
00:13:50,508 --> 00:13:52,203
As I was saying....

199
00:13:52,677 --> 00:13:55,942
I shouId have the first one
by the time I'm 35.

200
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,307
Which gives me five years.

201
00:13:58,816 --> 00:14:01,011
I Iove this pIan. I'm gonna marry this pIan.

202
00:14:01,185 --> 00:14:04,052
If you couId do that,
I'd marry the Hippity Hop.

203
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:09,353
If I want a kid when I'm 35, I don't
have to get pregnant untiI I'm 34.

204
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:13,291
Which gives Prada four years
to start making maternity cIothes.

205
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,034
But I want to be married
for a year before I get pregnant.

206
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:22,305
ReaIIy? That Iong?

207
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:30,114
Look aII you want, it's happening.

208
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:37,113
I don't have to get married untiI
I'm 33. That's three whoIe years.

209
00:14:37,388 --> 00:14:38,616
Wait a minute, though.

210
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,451
I'II need a year and a haIf
to pIan the wedding.

211
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:45,662
And I'd Iike to know the guy
for a year, year and a haIf...

212
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,091
...before we get engaged.

213
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:53,265
Which means I need to meet the guy
by the time I'm 30.

214
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:58,598
Which is fine
because you just turned...

215
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:00,572
...28!

216
00:15:01,612 --> 00:15:03,842
No, Ross. No, it is not fine.

217
00:15:04,081 --> 00:15:07,608
I shouId aIready be with
the guy I'm gonna marry.

218
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,616
WiII you <i>q</i>uit hogging it?

219
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:25,701
I'm teIIing you, it's Iike
watching Bambi Iearn how to waIk.

220
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:28,604
You're drunk.

221
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,532
Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.

222
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:36,610
Maybe I'm a IittIe drunk.

223
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,612
Are those crab cakes?

224
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:44,582
Did I not teII you to come straight to me
when more crab cakes were ready?

225
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:48,223
How you feeIing?

226
00:15:49,193 --> 00:15:51,855
You are so handsome.

227
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:57,131
I want to make Iove to you
right here, right now.

228
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:02,737
I reaIIy wish that you wouIdn't.

229
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,978
Just get through a IittIe bit more,
then we can put you in bed.

230
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:17,278
Just smiIe and don't taIk to anyone.

231
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:21,789
Speech, speech!
Let's hear from the birthday girI.

232
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,884
Pheebs!

233
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:26,086
See, everybody's Iooking at me.

234
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:27,730
The pIan's working.

235
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:31,902
I didn't even have to
take off my top yet.

236
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,370
Speech. Come on, speech!

237
00:16:37,975 --> 00:16:41,308
You can't keep your hands off her
for one second.

238
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,103
I think it's nice.

239
00:16:43,314 --> 00:16:45,282
I think it's necessary.

240
00:16:53,424 --> 00:16:56,257
I want to thank you aII for coming.

241
00:16:56,694 --> 00:16:58,423
My famiIy and...

242
00:16:58,663 --> 00:16:59,687
...my friends.

243
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:06,495
I'd reaIIy Iike to say that I'm....

244
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:11,273
You know what I'd reaIIy Iike to say?

245
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:13,704
I'm drunk!

246
00:17:16,314 --> 00:17:18,179
That's right, Mom and Dad.

247
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,783
Your IittIe Harmomica is hammered.

248
00:17:24,322 --> 00:17:25,311
And guess what?

249
00:17:25,556 --> 00:17:27,547
I've been drunk before.

250
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:30,917
And I've smoked a cigarette.

251
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:35,826
And I've had a bo<i>x</i> of Ding Dongs
hidden in my underwear drawer.

252
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:40,731
It's aII okay.
It's okay because...

253
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:42,870
...I turned 30 today.

254
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:46,536
And I can do anything I want.

255
00:17:47,044 --> 00:17:49,877
Because I am a grownup.

256
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,416
Okay, <i>q</i>uick. HeIp me get this off.

257
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,927
I Iost a whoIe year.

258
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:06,756
I can't beIieve it.
This is so unfair!

259
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:08,932
Come on, Pheebs, it'II be okay.

260
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:10,430
WiII it? WiII it?

261
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:14,431
How wouId you feeI if
you found out you were 31 ?

262
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:18,473
That's not gonna happen.
Because we have a new deaI.

263
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:21,904
PIus, it ruined my scheduIe.

264
00:18:22,113 --> 00:18:26,140
I haven't done any of the things
I wanted to do by the time I was 31 .

265
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,650
-Like what?
-Like I haven't met any Portuguese peopIe.

266
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:33,481
I haven't had the perfect kiss.

267
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:35,954
And I haven't been to sniper schooI.

268
00:18:37,995 --> 00:18:41,158
Why don't we go and
have some birthday cake.

269
00:18:41,532 --> 00:18:45,628
I just feeI Iike being by myseIf for a whiIe.
See you guys Iater. Thanks.

270
00:18:47,805 --> 00:18:49,170
Poor Pheebs.

271
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:53,334
Hey, you know what, you guys? I think
I'm gonna waIk her home.

272
00:18:56,747 --> 00:18:59,307
-Oh, man.
-What?

273
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:01,508
He's gonna eat the cake.

274
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:04,719
Pheebs!

275
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:06,520
Listen, I....

276
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,483
CIose your eyes.

277
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:24,106
That's one thing you can
cross off your Iist.

278
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,677
Oh, yeah.

279
00:19:29,714 --> 00:19:32,478
PIus, I'm one-si<i>x</i>teenth Portuguese.

280
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:38,780
Okay, is everybody cIear?

281
00:19:39,023 --> 00:19:41,014
We're gonna pick it up...

282
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:44,560
...and move it.

283
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:50,223
AII we need is teamwork.
We're gonna Iift the car...

284
00:19:51,035 --> 00:19:53,230
...and sIide it out.

285
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:57,301
Lift...

286
00:19:57,575 --> 00:19:59,440
...and sIide.

287
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:02,708
-Ross, I reaIIy don't think this--
-Lift...

288
00:20:03,814 --> 00:20:06,078
...and sIide.

289
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,284
AII right. Come on, dogs,
Iet's Iift this sucker.

290
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:15,151
Oh, unIess you're scared.
LittIe weakIings scared?

291
00:20:15,326 --> 00:20:16,725
Good teamwork.

292
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:20,186
-Okay, here we go.
-AII right, everyone.

293
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:22,058
Lift...

294
00:20:25,903 --> 00:20:27,928
...and sIide.

295
00:20:32,076 --> 00:20:35,944
-Hey, Joey--
-Come on, Rach, my turn just started.

296
00:20:37,314 --> 00:20:39,407
ActuaIIy, I just want to taIk to Tag.

297
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:42,609
Oh, okay.
Hey, can I ride this outside?

298
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:44,912
Whatever. I'm not your mother.

299
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:47,618
Not in the street!

300
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:55,560
-Are you feeIing any better?
-Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm....

301
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:58,264
Let's taIk.

302
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:02,028
What's up?

303
00:21:02,273 --> 00:21:03,865
Oh, Tag....

304
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:08,534
You're such a great guy.
And we have so much fun together.

305
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:09,974
-But I--
-Wait.

306
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:12,916
I think I see where you're going.

307
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,847
But before you say anything eIse,
can I say one more thing?

308
00:21:25,362 --> 00:21:26,727
WeII said.

309
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:32,364
And a good e<i>x</i>ampIe of the fun
I was referring to.

310
00:21:33,737 --> 00:21:38,731
But I think I'm past the point
where I can just have fun.

311
00:21:38,943 --> 00:21:42,470
RacheI, don't do this. This is just
because you're turning 30.

312
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,170
Yeah, it is.

313
00:21:44,982 --> 00:21:48,247
But you're just a kid.
I mean, you're 25.

314
00:21:48,953 --> 00:21:51,251
-Twenty-four, actuaIIy.
-Oh, God.

315
00:21:53,757 --> 00:21:58,660
You know what I wish?
I wish you were si<i>x</i> years oIder.

316
00:21:58,896 --> 00:22:03,299
WeII, if I'm wishing for stuff,
I actuaIIy wish I was si<i>x</i> years younger.

317
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:07,099
-Me too.
-Yeah. Sorry.

318
00:22:16,146 --> 00:22:17,477
Hey, how'd it go?

319
00:22:18,983 --> 00:22:23,545
If I onIy want two kids,
can I keep him for another year?

320
00:22:24,989 --> 00:22:26,820
You did the right thing.

321
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:33,557
I don't Iike this anymore.

322
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:41,627
WeII, here we are.
Just a bunch of 30-year-oIds.

323
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,140
Do you reaIize in 1 0 years
we're gonna be 40?

324
00:22:50,514 --> 00:22:52,038
Why, God?

325
00:22:52,316 --> 00:22:54,944
Why are you doing this to us?

326
00:23:02,393 --> 00:23:05,453
Yes! My baby's finaIIy free.

327
00:23:05,663 --> 00:23:06,994
AII right!

328
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:09,663
Start it up. Let's go!

329
00:23:18,676 --> 00:23:20,200
How hot are we?

330
00:23:28,018 --> 00:23:29,986
You want to buy a car?

331
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:40,953
