1
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:10,034
Hey, you guys ever wonder
why they call it "Thanksgiving"?

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:16,142
Okay. Hey, Monica, you're doing
Thanksgiving next week, right?

3
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:19,513
Because Carol's taking Ben
to her parents' place in Florida.

4
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:23,247
Okay, okay.
I'll make Thanksgiving dinner.

5
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,414
You don't have to beg.

6
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,583
I didn't beg.
I just asked once.

7
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:30,756
You could beg, you know.

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,330
Monica said
I could make dessert this year.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,991
-You're gonna cook something?
-Hey, I cook.

10
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:39,195
Offering people gum is not cooking.

11
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,273
Are you sure Monica said
you could cook this year?

12
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,639
I remember her saying in two years.
You said in two years, right?

13
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,279
No, I promised her.

14
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:52,316
Are you sure you want to start out with
something as big as Thanksgiving dinner?

15
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:55,648
I mean, maybe you wanna try
a little Thanksgiving breakfast?

16
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,188
Maybe a Thanksgiving snack?

17
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,292
Come on, you guys,
I can do this.

18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,621
Remember, I made those
peanut butter cookies.

19
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,990
What are you guys so worried about?
Cooking is easy.

20
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,727
You just follow the recipe.

21
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,931
If it says, "boil two cups of salt,"
you just boil two cups of salt.

22
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,111
The One Where Ross Got High

23
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,072
Okay, great. Bye.

24
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,049
Guess who's coming
to Thanksgiving dinner?

25
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,914
Sidney Poitier?

26
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,580
I miss Rachel.

27
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,347
My parents.

28
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,926
Great, they haven't seen the place
since I moved in.

29
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,528
If you could not mention that
we live together, that'd be great.

30
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,029
I was thinking we'd eat around 4.

31
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,536
Why can't I tell them
we live together?

32
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,637
They don't know we're dating.
Should we eat in the kitchen?

33
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,739
Why haven't you told them?

34
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,706
Well, I was going to. I really was.

35
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,107
But then somewhere,
just out of nowhere, I didn't.

36
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,543
Why not? Wouldn't they be happy?

37
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:36,084
So, dinner in the kitchen around 4.
I'll see you then.

38
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,779
Why wouldn't they be happy?

39
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,615
Well, because...

40
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,723
mainly...

41
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,893
they don't like you.

42
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,497
-I'm sorry.
-What? Why? Why?

43
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,193
Maybe because you used to be aloof...

44
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:53,463
or that you're sarcastic
or that you joke around...

45
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,437
or that you throw your clothes
on the couch.

46
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,134
Is this why they don't like me
or you don't like me?

47
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,812
I know I should have told them.
I shouldn't care what they think.

48
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,006
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,311
It'll be okay because when
they come over, I will be charming.

50
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,150
I will make them love me,
then we'll tell them.

51
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,451
Will that work?

52
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,130
I can be pretty charming, babe.
I won you over, didn't l?

53
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,959
I don't think you'll ever get
my parents that drunk.

54
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,441
Hey. Oh, good, Ross.
Your parents like me, right?

55
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,609
Yes, of course they like you.

56
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,311
Monica told me they don't.

57
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,174
Yeah, they don't like you.

58
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,338
Do you know why?

59
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:41,453
Maybe it's because you're sarcastic
or maybe it's because you..

60
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,652
If people don't know,
they shouldn't just guess!

61
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,455
Another Thanksgiving
with nothing to give thanks for.

62
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,562
Maybe I give thanks
for you shutting up, huh?

63
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,834
Maybe I give thanks by taking
my PlayStation to my place.

64
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,866
Maybe I love you.

65
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,272
Hey, guys.

66
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:06,002
No, I don't want
to play video games, Joey!

67
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,283
Are you guys going
to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?

68
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,440
Yeah, why?

69
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,144
Me and my friends are
doing Thanksgiving uptown.

70
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,218
I thought you might like to come.

71
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,082
For real?

72
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,789
You should go to Chandler's.
None of us can cook.

73
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,461
We'll just drink all day.

74
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,528
We go to yours!

75
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:32,061
We have to stop across the hall
because it's my sister.

76
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,536
But, you know, actually,
growing up with a sister was nice...

77
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,039
because it helped me
understand women.

78
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,905
Yeah, you should tell
your friends that.

79
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,006
Okay.

80
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:51,123
How you got three women to marry you,
I'll never know.

81
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,597
Hey, Mon, look.
I'm melting butter.

82
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,766
That's great, Rach. You now have
the cooking skills of a hot day.

83
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,504
Phoebe, check it out!
For my dessert...

84
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,236
I'm making a traditional
English trifle.

85
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:16,211
Wow. That sounds great!
And what are you making, Monica?

86
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,544
In case Rachel's dessert is
so good that I eat all of it...

87
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,987
and there's none left
for anybody else!

88
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,415
Nothing.

89
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,785
Nothing?

90
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,419
No, sweetie. I trust you.

91
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,964
If I mess this up,
there's nothing else for dessert?

92
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,291
You won't mess it up.

93
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:40,399
I love that. You really
have faith in me. Thank you.

94
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,598
Question: How do you know
when the butter is done?

95
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:47,107
It's done about two minutes
before it looks like that.

96
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:56,149
-The food smells great, Mon.
-And the place looks so nice.

97
00:05:56,422 --> 00:06:01,485
-Hey, happy Thanksgiving, everybody!
-Happy Thanksgiving!

98
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,390
-Well, this has been great.
-See you.

99
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,621
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

100
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,725
Where you going?

101
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:12,871
We did say we'd stop by this little
thing Joey's roommate is having.

102
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,605
Oh, Janine,
the really hot dancer girl?

103
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,542
Some would say she's attractive, yes.

104
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,914
Who else is going to be there?

105
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,139
Her friends.

106
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,442
Her dancer friends?

107
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,312
Yes! All right?

108
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,512
All of her hot dancer friends
are gonna be there...

109
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,384
and they'll be drinking and dancing
and we really want to go!

110
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,563
Dude, we were good.

111
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,763
You're not going. You said
you'd eat here and you'll eat here.

112
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,937
Yeah, and leaving us
to go see hot dancer girls...

113
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,106
is not very Thanksgiving-y.

114
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,905
Oh, but it is.

115
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:53,545
It's like the first Thanksgiving when
the Indians and Pilgrims sat down.

116
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,214
Then the Indians taught
the Pilgrims...

117
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,680
...what it meant to be hot
in the New World!

118
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,883
Fellas, I really think
you should stay here.

119
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,319
You're just jealous
because you can't go.

120
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,917
That is so not true.

121
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,760
-Hello, everybody!
-Hi!

122
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,000
Hi, Dad. Mom.

123
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,239
Look! Look who it is!
It's Chandler!

124
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,270
Oh, yes, of course.
Hello, Chandler.

125
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,005
Mr. and Mrs. Geller,
you look wonderful.

126
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,978
It is great to have you here.
Let us take your coats.

127
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,852
Whoa, it snowing out there?

128
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:36,946
No.

129
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,356
Monica, all this food looks wonderful.

130
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,397
You should do this for a living.

131
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,908
Okay, I have dandruff.
There's no need to laugh and point.

132
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,701
Chandler was laughing at your joke.

133
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,573
My joke wasn't funny.

134
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,710
Chandler laughs at everything.

135
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,182
That's one of the great things about him.

136
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,516
Rach, I just remembered.

137
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,852
I had a dream
about Mr. Geller last night.

138
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:15,925
Really?

139
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,028
I dreamt that he saved me
from a burning building...

140
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,323
and he was so brave and so strong.

141
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,365
And it's making me look at him
totally differently.

142
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:29,730
He used to be just
"Jack Geller, Monica and Ross' dad."

143
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:33,275
Now he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."

144
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,618
I don't know. To me,
he'll always be "Jack Geller...

145
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,083
walks in while you're changing."

146
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:49,358
You know, Dad, Chandler is one
of Ross' very best friends.

147
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,894
Yes, I know.

148
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,459
Ross sure is a great guy.

149
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,691
I've always felt that
how a man turns out...

150
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,698
is a reflection on his father.

151
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:02,498
I always thought that too.
Tell me, what does your father do?

152
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,069
He's a headliner of a...

153
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,144
gay burlesque show.

154
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,818
You're killing us.
Will you serve the dessert already?

155
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,615
There's drunken dancers a-waiting!

156
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,919
Look at it. Isn't it beautiful?

157
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,457
Yeah. What is it?

158
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,957
It's a trifle.
It's got all these layers.

159
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,391
First there's a layer
of ladyfingers, then jam...

160
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:31,330
then custard,
which I made from scratch...

161
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,402
then raspberries,
more ladyfingers...

162
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,665
then beef sauteed
with peas and onions...

163
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,476
then a little bit more custard...

164
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,142
then bananas and then
I put whipped cream on top.

165
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,649
What was the one right before bananas?

166
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,891
The beef.
Yeah, that was weird to me too.

167
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,392
But then I thought,
"Well, there's minced-meat pie."

168
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,156
That's an English dessert.

169
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,665
These people just put
strange things in their food.

170
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,996
Can I borrow rum from your place?

171
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,366
Yeah, sure.

172
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,735
While I'm gone,
don't you sneak a taste.

173
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,778
Beef in a dessert?

174
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,274
No, no, no. There is no way.

175
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,648
I know. And only one layer of jam?

176
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,991
What is up with that?

177
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,154
Oh, my God.

178
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,331
The pages are stuck together.

179
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,693
Chandler!

180
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,835
Oh, my God. She made
half an English trifle and...

181
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,679
half a shepherd's pie!

182
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,610
Man, now she's gonna start all over.

183
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,685
We're never gonna get to introduce
the hot girls to the New World.

184
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,917
No, no, we will.
We just won't tell her she messed up.

185
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,161
Just let her serve
the beef-custard thing?

186
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,199
Yeah. It'll be like
a funny Thanksgiving story.

187
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,501
Vomiting stories are funny, I guess.

188
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,698
Joey. God, your
apartment is, like, 100 degrees.

189
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,467
Did it make you want
to walk around in your underwear?

190
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,401
No.

191
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,142
Still not hot enough!

192
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,518
Rachel. Okay, look at him.

193
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,085
Look at those strong hands.

194
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,917
Oh, what I wouldn't give
to be that can of condensed milk.

195
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,761
Chandler was just saying
how beautiful your sweater is.

196
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,662
Thank you. I just bought it.

197
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:48,431
Yes, well, it's very beautiful and
it's cream-colored and tight and...

198
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:54,540
I don't mean tight. It's not tight.
Not that I was looking at...

199
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,306
What's the matter with him?

200
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,916
I think he's stoned again.

201
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,615
What?

202
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,312
I need to talk to you.

203
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,699
I think I might know why
my parents don't like you.

204
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,763
Why?

205
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,561
Okay, remember we were young.

206
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:21,634
Spring break, sophomore year,
I got high in my bedroom...

207
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,068
and my parents walked in
and smelled it...

208
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,474
so I told them that you had gotten
stoned and jumped out the window.

209
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,282
Why did you do that?

210
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:35,318
I don't know. Yours was the first
name that popped into my head.

211
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,454
I didn't think it'd matter.

212
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,779
How could it not matter?

213
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,559
How was I to know
we'd be friends after college...

214
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,785
and you'd be living with my sister?

215
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,758
What about the
"friends forever" stuff?

216
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,530
I don't know. I was all high.

217
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:58,905
Mom and Dad sent me to find out
if you were trying to get Ross stoned.

218
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:04,376
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot
in college, and he blamed it on me!

219
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,183
I can't believe you!

220
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:10,912
We haven't told them we're together
because they hate me, so fix this.

221
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:15,116
Okay, okay, I'll tell them
it wasn't Chandler who got high.

222
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,886
Now, who should I say it was?

223
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:23,298
You! It's not like it's a big deal.
You don't still do it or anything.

224
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:27,870
All right. Now, who should I say
tricked me into doing it?

225
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,910
Nobody. You're gonna go out there
and tell them exactly what happened.

226
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,874
-Really?
-Yes!

227
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,111
Okay.

228
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,341
Wait, is there anything else
I should know?

229
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,247
No.. Oh, yeah....

230
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,555
You microwaved a bunch
of my dad's records.

231
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,787
Why?

232
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:53,489
Evidently, you weren't very good
at handling your high.

233
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:05,475
Dad, please don't pick
your teeth out here.

234
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,611
And if you're gonna put your feet up..

235
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,370
Leave him alone!

236
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,046
Will you hurry up?

237
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:17,221
Did you not hear me when I told you
that Janine's friends are dancers?

238
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,323
And that they're gonna
be drinking a lot?

239
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:24,989
No, I did. But tell me again
because it's so romantic.

240
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,795
You're whipping so slow.
Do it faster!

241
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,126
I don't want to make any mistakes!

242
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,305
If I screw it up,
everybody's gonna be like:

243
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:37,635
"Oh, remember that Thanksgiving
when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"

244
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:43,478
Just let me worry about making it,
and you just worry about eating it.

245
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,147
Oh, I am.

246
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:50,778
-If you don't tell them, then I will.
-Okay. Fine.

247
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,118
Ross, can I talk to you for a second?

248
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,153
Can it wait? I have
to tell my parents something.

249
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,853
No, it can't? Okay.

250
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:07,169
We have to tell Rachel
she messed up her dessert.

251
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,603
What? What is with everybody?

252
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,469
It's Thanksgiving, not...

253
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,768
Truth Day!

254
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:18,146
Look, when everyone eats
that banana-meat thing...

255
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,910
they'll all make fun of her.
Do you want that?

256
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,553
We'll just get everyone
to act like they like it.

257
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,758
That way, no one makes fun of her...

258
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,258
and we still get to go
to sweet-potato pie.

259
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,297
Dude, they're not objects.

260
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,929
Just kidding. I'll talk to them.
You distract her.

261
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,865
Hey, Rach, can I talk to you
outside for a sec?

262
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,007
Okay.

263
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,143
What's up, Ross?

264
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,047
So....

265
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,953
Thanksgiving.

266
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:04,288
The holiday season is upon us.

267
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,966
And...

268
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,362
you look nice today.

269
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,899
-Oh, no. No, Ross, don't do this.
-What?

270
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:20,509
I don't think us getting back
together is a good idea.

271
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,916
I thought this might happen today.

272
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,346
I know the holidays can be rough...

273
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,750
and it's probably hard
for you to be alone right now.

274
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,083
You're alone.

275
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,250
No, I live with Phoebe.

276
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,430
I mean, you're alone-alone.

277
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:44,292
And it's just not the time
for us. I'm sorry.

278
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,800
Oh, well.
Can't blame a guy for trying.

279
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,038
And if anyone needs help
pretending to like it...

280
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,273
I learned some things in acting
class. Try rubbing your stomach.

281
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,446
Or saying, "Mmm."

282
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,948
Smiling.

283
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,956
I'm not gonna pay
for those acting classes anymore.

284
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:16,158
Rachel, there you are.
Let's serve that dessert already!

285
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:20,565
Joey, you have to stop rushing me.
You don't get any dessert.

286
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:21,898
Really?

287
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,403
No, just kidding.
I would never do that to you.

288
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,443
Okay, everybody, it's trifle time.

289
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:33,310
So, Rach, this is a traditional
English trifle, isn't it?

290
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:34,949
-It sure is.
-Wow.

291
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,281
So did you make it
with beef or eggplant?

292
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:41,059
-Beef.
-I can't have any. I don't eat meat.

293
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,865
Monica, I want you
to have the first taste.

294
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,461
Really?

295
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,632
Wait, you only got whipped cream.

296
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,034
You gotta take a bite
with all the layers.

297
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,873
You dropped a pea.

298
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,780
Well?

299
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,925
It's good.

300
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,069
Really? How good?

301
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,297
It's so good that I feel selfish...

302
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,806
about being the only one
who's eating it.

303
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,502
I think we should have everyone
taste how good it is.

304
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,839
Especially Ross.

305
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:48,285
This is so good that I'm gonna
go enjoy it on the balcony.

306
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:54,423
So that I can enjoy the view
whilst I enjoy my dessert.

307
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,661
I've gotta call my friend...

308
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,530
and tell her how good
this is from Monica's room.

309
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,103
I'll help dial.

310
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,641
I'm gonna go into the bathroom...

311
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,848
so I can look at it
in the mirror as I eat it.

312
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,780
What was that all about?
Does it not taste good?

313
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,217
-Let me try it.
-No, no!

314
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,954
All gone!

315
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,659
So good.

316
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,998
Maybe Chandler has some left.

317
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,798
It tastes like feet.

318
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,542
I like it!

319
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,172
Are you kidding?

320
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,981
What's not to like? Custard, good.

321
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,382
Jam, good. Meat, good.

322
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:56,216
So a bird just grabbed it...

323
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,692
and then tried
to fly away with it...

324
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,431
and then just dropped it
on the street?

325
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,934
If it's any consolation,
before the bird dropped it...

326
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,234
he seemed to enjoy it.

327
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,169
Rachel, come here.

328
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,875
I was taking my Thanksgiving nap
and I had another dream.

329
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:23,111
-Do I want to hear this?
-I don't know, let's see.

330
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,524
I dreamt we were getting married...

331
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:29,591
and he left because
he had to go fight a fire.

332
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:33,356
So I went to a nightclub
and I saw him making out with a girl.

333
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,432
Oh, my God, he dream-cheated on you!

334
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,766
But then Jacques Cousteau came...

335
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,371
and he kicked his ass
for betraying me.

336
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,200
So cool!

337
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,741
Then he took me diving
and introduced me to his sea horse...

338
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:51,416
who was coming on to me.
Please, that is not gonna happen.

339
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:57,283
Boy, I'm glad I wore
the big belt today.

340
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,749
Five minutes ago, a line like that
would have floored me.

341
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:06,959
But now, nothing. Well, not nothing.
I am still a woman.

342
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,303
Ross? Let's go.

343
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,069
Oh, yeah.
About telling Mom and Dad...

344
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,105
I was thinking about
maybe writing a letter.

345
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,505
That's it. You've had your chance.

346
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:26,013
Mom, Dad. Ross smoked pot in college.

347
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,486
You are such a tattletale!

348
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,853
Mom, Dad...

349
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,830
you remember that time
you walked in my room...

350
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,826
and smelled marijuana?

351
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,000
Yes.

352
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,436
I told you it was Chandler...

353
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:52,040
who was smoking the pot but...

354
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,313
it was me. I'm sorry.

355
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:57,639
It was you?

356
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,386
And Dad,
Chandler didn't melt your records.

357
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,616
Ross did.

358
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,346
-Is that true?
-And Dad...

359
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,618
you know that mailman
that you got fired?

360
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:12,730
He didn't steal your Playboys.
Ross did.

361
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:21,137
Well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break
the porch swing. Monica did!

362
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,400
Ross hasn't worked
at the museum for a year!

363
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,746
Monica and Chandler
are living together!

364
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:37,779
Ross married Rachel in Vegas!
And got divorced! Again!

365
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,625
I love Jacques Cousteau!

366
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:48,456
I wasn't supposed
to put beef in the trifle!

367
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,402
I want to go!

368
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:58,540
That's a lot of information
to get in 30 seconds.

369
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:02,944
All right. Joey, if you want
to leave, just leave.

370
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:08,948
Rachel, no, you weren't supposed
to put beef in the trifle.

371
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,155
It did not taste good.

372
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,684
Phoebe, I'm sorry...

373
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:19,125
but I think
Jacques Cousteau is dead.

374
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,732
Monica, why you felt
you had to hide the fact...

375
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,666
that you're in an important
relationship is beyond me.

376
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:29,805
And we kind of figured
about the porch swing.

377
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,003
Ross.

378
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,337
Drugs?

379
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,581
Divorced again?

380
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,547
What happened, son?

381
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,716
I got tricked into all those things.

382
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:50,957
Chandler, you've been
Ross' best friend all these years...

383
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:54,027
stuck by him
during the drug problems...

384
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:59,134
and now you've taken on
Monica as well.

385
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:02,635
Well, I don't know what to say.

386
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,739
You're a wonderful human being.

387
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,310
-Thank you!
-No.

388
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,378
Thank you!

389
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:17,650
Monica and Ross, I don't know what
I'm gonna do about the two of you.

390
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,617
I'll talk to them.

391
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,697
You guys, it was bananas...

392
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,299
cream and beef!

393
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:35,004
I just cannot believe that you ate
that so that I wouldn't feel bad.

394
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:38,472
Well, actually, I didn't eat mine.
It's still in the bathroom.

395
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:39,666
No, I ate that.

396
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,506
And we left ours in Monica's bedroom.

397
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:47,014
Nope, got it and got yours too.

398
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,511
Chandler, are you gonna stick
with that bird story?

399
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,090
It was a big bird.
Swooped right in there.

400
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,225
-Hi.
-Oh, Janine.

401
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,591
-It's not over, is it?
-Yeah.

402
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:04,030
We all got depressed.
The holidays and everything, we're alone.

403
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,965
Yeah, well, at least you have Joey.

404
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,265
But Ross is really alone.

405
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,667
Well, you're always welcome here.

406
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,209
This is my mom and my dad.

407
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,074
-This is Janine.
-Nice to meet you.

408
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,978
-I think we've already met.
-Really?

409
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:23,018
I live across the hall.
You walked in on me when I was changing.
