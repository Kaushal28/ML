1
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:08,438
"We've got 3 minutes till it blows.
We won't make it!"

2
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:11,633
"You've got to get out of here!
Save yourself!"

3
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:14,811
"I won't leave you."

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,452
"Don't worry about me.
I'm a robot. I'm just a machine!"

5
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,790
-"No, you're not. Not to me."
-Oh, my God.

6
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,987
-What?
-I am extremely talented.

7
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,653
-Yeah. You're great.
-Yeah.

8
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:34,823
-Okay, let's take it from..
-No, I mean, I was really acting my ass off.

9
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,665
I thought I was pretty good, too.

10
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,669
Yeah, you're solid. You're just no me.

11
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,468
You know what?
I think that's enough for now.

12
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,271
I don't want to be over-rehearsed.

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,313
Fine. I'll do it without you!

14
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,409
I don't need you or anybody else!

15
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,883
I'm gonna make it on my own!

16
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,354
You'll see! You'll all see!

17
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,622
The One With Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

18
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,627
So what are you auditioning for?

19
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,098
It's a new TV show.

20
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,764
I'm up for the part of Mac,
Machiavelli, or "Mac"!

21
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,974
I'm a detective and I solve crimes
with my robot partner.

22
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,547
He's a computerized humanoid...

23
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,879
electronically enhanced
secret enforcer.

24
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,544
Or "C.H.E.E.S.E."

25
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:08,123
-So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.?
-That's the title!

26
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:13,397
They lucked out
that the initials spell "cheese."

27
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,124
That is lucky.

28
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,004
So Joey, if you get this,
you're gonna be, like...

29
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,866
the star of your own TV show.

30
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:25,511
I mean, you'll be like the "Big Cheese"
or the "Big Mac." Hey, you love those!

31
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,240
Don't get your hopes up.
It probably won't happen.

32
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,110
Why would you say that?

33
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,343
Well, I mean, come on, guys.
My own TV show?

34
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,318
-I don't know if I'm good enough.
-I am.

35
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:42,355
What are you talking about?
You're a terrific actor.

36
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:46,693
-You really think so?
-How can you even ask that question?

37
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,799
-She's pretty.
-Yeah. And she's really nice too.

38
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,098
She taught me all about
how to work with cameras...

39
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:57,037
and "smell the fart" acting.

40
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,077
-I'm sorry. What?
-Excuse me?

41
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,041
It's like you got so many lines
to learn so fast...

42
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,186
sometimes you need time
to remember your next one.

43
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:13,456
So while you're thinking of it, you
take this pause where you look intense.

44
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,594
You know, like this:

45
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,963
Okay.

46
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,427
Here's my scene! Here's my scene!

47
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:26,799
Mrs. Wallace? I'm Dr. Drake Ramorey,
your sister's surgeon.

48
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,241
You sister is suffering from a...

49
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:39,779
Well, Eva, we've done
some excellent work here.

50
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:46,486
And I would have to say
your problem is quite clear.

51
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,156
All you want is a tinkle

52
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,264
What you envy's a schwang

53
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,895
A thing through which you can tinkle

54
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,001
Or play with or simply let hang

55
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,574
I play Al Pacino's butt.

56
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:07,835
All right?

57
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:11,848
He goes into the shower and then,
I'm his butt.

58
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,542
-Oh, my God.
-Come on, you guys.

59
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:18,088
This is a movie and Al Pacino's in it,
and that's big!

60
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:22,159
It's terrific. You deserve this.
After years of struggling...

61
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,957
you've finally cracked your way
into show business.

62
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:33,031
Okay, fine, make jokes. I don't care.
This is a big break for me.

63
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,639
-No, you're right, it is.
-Yeah.

64
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,435
So, you gonna invite us
to the big opening?

65
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,941
All right, I'm out of here. Wish me luck.

66
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:48,109
Good luck, good luck
We all wish you good luck

67
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,255
Yeah, whatever.

68
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,086
Wow, if I could dance,
I'd be a triple threat.

69
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,436
It's your turn.

70
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,302
Oh, are we playing this?

71
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,132
How'd the audition go?

72
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,543
Terrible. I messed up every word.
I shouldn't even be an actor.

73
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:20,913
Wait. Are you pretending it didn't
go well, but it really did go well?

74
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,286
-Yeah, did I fool you?
-Totally!

75
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,923
-So it did go well?
-Amazingly well!

76
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,565
-Great!
-It's down to me and two other guys.

77
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,893
And they're really good.

78
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,903
One's from those allergy commercials
who's chased by flowers.

79
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,733
Oh, I love that guy!

80
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,802
What are you doing?

81
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,706
What am I doing?

82
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:52,248
I'm so nervous, you know?
The callback is tomorrow at 5:00.

83
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:57,287
-I feel like my head's gonna explode.
-Well, it is overdue.

84
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:01,416
-Don't worry. You'll be fine.
-But it's so much pressure.

85
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:05,757
What you guys do is different.
I don't know if you'd understand.

86
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,733
Yeah, we don't have pressure
at our jobs.

87
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:14,896
I know what time it is, but I'm looking
at the wee-ness and I'm not happy.

88
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,469
Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.

89
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,705
-Is it dirty?
-Don't worry, I'll wash it.

90
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,041
Don't. I like it dirty.

91
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,318
That's your call.

92
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,821
So what are you going to do next?

93
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,492
I thought I'd cut up the tomatoes.

94
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,958
Are they firm?

95
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,363
-They're all right.
-You sure they haven't gone bad?

96
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,163
You sure they're not very, very bad?

97
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,943
-No, really. They're okay.
-You gonna slice them real nice?

98
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:56,340
Actually, I was gonna
do them julienne.

99
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,215
I'm out of here.

100
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,082
I'm quitting. I just helped
an 81-year-old woman put on a thong...

101
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,314
and she didn't even buy it.

102
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,122
I'm quitting. That's it.
I'm talking to my boss right now.

103
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,387
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

104
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,662
Bye. Call me when you
get this message.

105
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,267
Well, what happened?

106
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:20,565
Well, he came in for a massage,
and everything was fine until...

107
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,566
Oh, my God.

108
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,938
And all of a sudden,
his hands weren't the problem anymore.

109
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,418
-Was it?
-Boy Scouts could've camped under there.

110
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,390
You ate my sandwich?

111
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,125
It was a mistake.
It could happen to anyone.

112
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,530
Really?

113
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,791
Now calm down.

114
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,131
Come look in my office.
Some of it may still be in the trash.

115
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,700
-What?
-Well, it was quite large.

116
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,969
I had to throw most of it away.

117
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,876
You threw my sandwich away?

118
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,616
My sandwich?

119
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,753
My sandwich!

120
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,748
It's just, I want this part so much.

121
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:17,253
If I don't get this part, I'm never gonna eat
macaroni and cheese again.

122
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,023
I didn't say that. That doesn't count.

123
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,130
Come on, guys.
It's not like I moved to Europe.

124
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,308
I just moved across the hall.

125
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,704
And we would have you over all the time...

126
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:35,574
if it weren't for Monica's allergies.

127
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,782
You're right, I could never lie to you.

128
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,385
She hates you.

129
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,090
Should I get that?

130
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,661
Hello? No, Joey's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

131
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:56,727
Yeah, okay. So the audition's
been moved from 5:00 to 2:30?

132
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,904
Okay, great. Bye.

133
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,772
-Aren't you dressed yet?
-Am I naked again?

134
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,944
We're meeting my parents
in 15 minutes.

135
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,885
I was just talking to the guys.
Look at them.

136
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,184
Is it okay if they come visit?

137
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,828
What about my allergies?

138
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,726
Right. Your allergies.

139
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,459
All her. She hates you.

140
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,315
Yes! All right.

141
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,751
How cool would it be if you could watch
a life-size version of this?

142
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:54,757
-I mean, how crazy would that be?
-As crazy as soccer?

143
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,322
Hello?

144
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,661
What are you talking about?
The audition's at 5.

145
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,671
Well, nobody told me.

146
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,470
Who'd you talk to?

147
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,576
Never mind.

148
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,951
You mean you didn't get it from this?

149
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:25,988
-The allergy guy got the part. Thanks.
-Maybe we can fix it.

150
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,921
Maybe we can send him
some big flowers and scare him!

151
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:34,498
How could you do this? This could've
turned my career around.

152
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:38,033
I messed up, okay?
I'm sorry. I really messed up.

153
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,603
Why'd you answer my phone?

154
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,004
-I have a machine!
-Which I bought for you.

155
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,978
Taught you how to use it.
You thought it was a copier.

156
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,273
If there was anything I could do,
I'd do it.

157
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,249
Everybody's allowed
one mistake, right?

158
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,355
He could have gotten me a VCR
or golf clubs.

159
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,687
But no, he has to get me
the "Woman Repeller."

160
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,595
The eyesore from
the "Liberace House of Crap!"

161
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,063
-It's not that bad.
-Easy for you to say.

162
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:12,067
You don't have to sport a reject
from the "Mr. T" collection.

163
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:16,199
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry!
I do! I do!

164
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,400
I pity the fool that...

165
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,912
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I were talking and...

166
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,483
one thing led to another and....

167
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,477
And what? Did you sleep with her?

168
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:33,489
-No! No, I just kissed her.
-What? That's even worse!

169
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,261
-How?
-I don't know! But it's the same!

170
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:40,860
I have no excuses.
I was over the line.

171
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,432
Over the line?

172
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,832
You're so far past the line
you can't even see it!

173
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,029
The line is a dot to you!

174
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,402
I'm not saying you should
magically forgive me.

175
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:55,177
But you're not perfect.
You've made errors in judgment.

176
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,537
Name one!

177
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,541
What happened?

178
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,520
Man! He promised
he wouldn't take the chairs!

179
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:08,783
How were you locked in?
And where the hell's all of our stuff?

180
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,286
This guy came to look at the unit...

181
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,898
and he didn't think
it was big enough to fit a man.

182
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,599
So you got in voluntarily?

183
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,101
I was trying to make a sale!

184
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,205
If I ever run into him again,
know what I'll do?

185
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,105
Bend over?

186
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,202
There's Lori.

187
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,817
Remember, no trading.
You get the pretty one, I get the mess.

188
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,886
-Hi, Joey.
-Hey.

189
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,989
Well, well. Look what you brought.

190
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,057
And what did you bring?

191
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,895
She's checking her coat.

192
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,398
Joey, I'm gonna go wash
the cab smell off my hands.

193
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,903
Will you get me a white Zinfandel
and a glass of red for Janice.

194
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,303
Janice?

195
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:08,614
Oh, my God!

196
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,750
Joey's tailor took advantage of me.

197
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,217
What?

198
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,927
No way. I've been going
to the guy for 12 years.

199
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,962
You said he'd do my inseam...

200
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,933
then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was...

201
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,297
What?

202
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,701
Cupping.

203
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,511
That's how they do pants!

204
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:40,575
-Isn't that how a tailor measures?
-Yes, yes, it is. In prison!

205
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,621
I said name one!

206
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:58,426
-I can't believe I did this.
-Stop beating yourself up.

207
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:02,232
People make mistakes.
These things happen.

208
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:06,471
There aren't any messages
you've forgotten to give me?

209
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,347
Apparently, you're not very good at it.

210
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,646
-Do you think he'll forgive me?
-Of course.

211
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,253
The important thing
is that you forgive yourself.

212
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,220
-You know what, I kind of have.
-Already?

213
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,951
That was pretty bad what you did.

214
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,059
He will forgive you.

215
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:28,757
I like to bring a pad with me when
I answer the phone, okay?

216
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:33,234
-You didn't see how mad he was.
-I'm sure he'll forgive you.

217
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:37,364
We've all been there. You fight,
you make up. That's how it works.

218
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,477
It took two people to break up
this relationship!

219
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,704
Yeah! You and that copy girl...

220
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,850
which yesterday you took
responsibility for!

221
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,020
I didn't know what I was taking
responsibility for.

222
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,416
-I didn't finish the letter.
-What?

223
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,752
-I fell asleep.
-You fell asleep?

224
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,722
It was 5:30 in the morning.

225
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:03,595
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.

226
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,831
Front and back!

227
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:13,910
And by the way?
Y-O-U, apostrophe R-E means, "you are."

228
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,343
Y-O-U-R means "your."

229
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:19,783
I can't believe I thought
of getting back together with you.

230
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,680
We are so over!

231
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:24,852
Fine by me!

232
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,856
And just so you know,
it's not that common...

233
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,930
it doesn't happen to every guy,
and it is a big deal!

234
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,390
I knew it!

235
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,936
-You had no right to go out with him.
-That's ridiculous..

236
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,399
-You sold me out!
-I did not!

237
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:47,203
-You did! You sold me..
-Would you let me talk?

238
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,377
Did you just flick me?

239
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,251
Well, you wouldn't let me finish and..

240
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,152
Stop it!

241
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,852
-Stop.
-Stop.

242
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,290
-All right. No, let's not do this.
-No!

243
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,455
-Happy thoughts.
-No!

244
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,725
-Happy thoughts.
-No!

245
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,166
Okay, now I'm gonna kick some ass!

246
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,583
All right. Now, I will let go
if you both stop.

247
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,018
-Fine.
-Fine.

248
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,688
There we go.

249
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:36,694
You know what? If we were in prison,
you guys would be my bitches.

250
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,731
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.

251
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:51,432
You hide my clothes?
I'm wearing everything you own.

252
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,641
Oh, my God!

253
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:59,309
Look at me, I'm Chandler!
Could I be wearing any more clothes?

254
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,885
Maybe if I wasn't going commando.

255
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:11,819
I tell you, it's hot with all this on.
I'd better not do any lunges.

256
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,476
Joey?

257
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:10,213
Got you the Joey special! Two pizzas!

258
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,452
Hello? Damn it!

259
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:19,721
Hello?

260
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:24,193
No, Joey's not here right now,
but I can take a message. I think.

261
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:28,732
He's still got a chance for the part?
That's great news!

262
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:33,435
Well, no, obviously not for the actor
who was mauled by his dog.

263
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,738
That's great.
I'll give Joey the message.

264
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,439
Yes!

265
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:40,375
Okay.

266
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,184
Mac...

267
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,550
audition...

268
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,358
at 2:00.

269
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,025
Allergy...

270
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,824
actor...

271
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,556
attacked.

272
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,938
By dog...

273
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,740
not...

274
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,600
flowers.

275
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:17,654
-Tell me you got the message.
-What message?

276
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:21,417
The actor playing Mac couldn't do it.
They needed you at 2.

277
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,788
What? It's 6:00!

278
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,396
Look! I wrote it on the board!

279
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:29,260
I wrote it down,
then went looking for you!

280
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,299
I went to Ross's, the coffee house...

281
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,301
I went to any place
they make sandwiches!

282
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,809
-I can't believe this, Chandler!
-I'm sorry.

283
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:43,504
-I don't know what to say!
-You might say congratulations!

284
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:47,446
I saw the board, I went to the audition,
I got the part!

285
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,787
Was that funny? I was worried.

286
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,252
-I'm sorry.
-That fake-out thing is just mean.

287
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,917
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

288
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,461
Well, that's good.

289
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,431
Because you didn't!
And I'm incredibly happy for you!

290
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:04,967
That's mean!

291
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,396
-You had me going!
-We could do this all day.

292
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,439
Yeah, you're right.

293
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,570
Let's talk about what a huge star
I'm gonna be.

294
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,976
You're gonna be huge!
I'm gonna hug you!

295
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,013
-You hug me!
-All right.

296
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,813
-Do we do this too much?
-I think so.

297
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,984
-Yeah. Get off me.
-Yeah.

298
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,117
"C.H.E.E.S.E.,
I'm not leaving without you.

299
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,525
Route your backup power source
through your CPU."

300
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:11,135
"l can't! My circuits are fried!
They're fried, I tell you!"

301
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,440
"Then I'll carry you!"

302
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,734
"That'll be a neat trick..."

303
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,304
"when you're dead!"

304
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,140
You don't have to yell.

305
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:30,446
There was just an explosion.
My hearing would be impaired.

306
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,217
I thought you were great.

307
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:36,121
For a minute, I was like,
"Where'd Ross go?"

308
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,224
Thank you. And that first scene
where you meet Mac...

309
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,333
-Yeah?
-Oh, my God. I mean...

310
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:44,828
And you know what?

311
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:48,473
That's enough for today.
Thanks for your help.

312
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,239
-Holding us back.
-Totally.
