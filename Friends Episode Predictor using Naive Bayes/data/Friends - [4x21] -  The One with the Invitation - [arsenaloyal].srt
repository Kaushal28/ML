1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,400
All of a sudden,
so much is happening.

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,105
I know.
Ross is getting married.

3
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:12,106
Phoebe's making people.

4
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:15,214
-Everybody's doing stuff.
-We just sit here.

5
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,781
If I died,
people would know I was here...

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,611
...only by the ass print
on this chair!

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:26,086
-What are we doing?
-Wasting our lives.

8
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,318
I meant for lunch.

9
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:33,161
We have to do something.
Something huge!

10
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,097
We could climb Mt. Everest.

11
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:39,895
Not something stupid.
Something huge!

12
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,233
I saw an ad for this video.

13
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:45,137
People climb that thing every day.
We could totally do that!

14
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:49,176
Why not?
I mean, it's just climbing.

15
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,214
-It's just steep!
-Yeah.

16
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:56,347
We're going! It'd be nice
to leave an ass print on Everest.

17
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,614
What's up?

18
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,624
-We're gonna climb Mt. Everest.
-Yeah, baby!

19
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,556
I looked into that.

20
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:09,292
Yeah, but it costs like $60,000,
and, you know, you could die.

21
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,234
And you would die.

22
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,766
We could get that Everest video.

23
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,572
We could do that
without risking our lives at all.

24
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,576
While we're at the video store,
we could rent Die Hard!

25
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,519
I just remembered.

26
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,283
That Everest thing is only available
through mail order.

27
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,854
So you'll stay here
and hang out with me?

28
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,667
But one of these days...

29
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,200
...we'll get off our butts
and rent Die Hard again!

30
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,531
The One with the lnvitation

31
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:41,725
That was fast. It usually takes me
hours to get Ben to go down for his nap.

32
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,830
He's such a sweetheart.
Do you know what he said?

33
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:49,196
-Good night, mommy.
-That's because he has lots of mommies.

34
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:54,303
Yeah, in fact, it's kind of become
his word for "woman".

35
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,443
So does your uncle Nathan
get an invite or not?

36
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,637
Oh, God!
Nobody likes him.

37
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:05,976
He's so cheap. He'd never fly
to London in a million years.

38
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,346
Invite him!

39
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,189
Did I do these neat enough?

40
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,356
Yeah, they're fine.

41
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,193
We'll say that Ben addressed them.

42
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,657
You invited Rachel then?

43
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,492
Sure, why not?

44
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,166
Really?

45
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:29,141
I wouldn't be comfortable having
any of my old lovers there.

46
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,436
Do you think
we shouldn't invite her?

47
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,409
You know I absolutely adore Rachel.

48
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:39,448
It's just that I thought
it might be awkward for you.

49
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,183
But it's absolutely your decision.

50
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,021
-More tea?
-Sure.

51
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,514
Earl Grey?

52
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,758
Fine, invite whoever you want.

53
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:59,998
I don't want to be single, okay?
I just want to be married again.

54
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,341
And I just want a million dollars!

55
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:13,041
Oh God, Monica. Thank God!

56
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,554
This is Rachel.
Another Lincoln High survivor.

57
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,055
This is Chandler.

58
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,420
Phoebe.

59
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:22,752
Joey.

60
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,758
-Do you remember Ross?
-Sure.

61
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,732
Back in high school...

62
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,405
...I had a major crush on you.

63
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:35,730
I knew.

64
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,337
You did?

65
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,180
I figured you thought
I was Monica's geeky brother.

66
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,414
I did.

67
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,415
Listen, do you think

68
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:52,124
Try not to let my intense
vulnerability become a factor.

69
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,127
Would it be okay
if I asked you out sometime?

70
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,430
Maybe.

71
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,904
Okay, maybe I will.

72
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,200
See, I see...

73
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,638
...big passion in your future.

74
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,636
-Really?
-I do.

75
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:18,212
Ross, you're so great.

76
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,119
It's never gonna happen.

77
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,898
I have a question.

78
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,436
Actually, it's not
so much a question.

79
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,163
It's more of a general wondering...

80
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,441
...ment.

81
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,141
Well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to....

82
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,919
Yes, yes.

83
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,276
That's right.

84
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,682
Look!

85
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,617
What?

86
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,654
Top of the world looking

87
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,921
Down on creation

88
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:09,464
And the only explanation I can find

89
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:15,536
Listen, missy! If you want this cart,
you'll have to take me with it!

90
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,878
-Did you see that?
-You were incredible!

91
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,709
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

92
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,284
I could not have done this
without you.

93
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,892
More clothes in the dryer?

94
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,292
I'm fine.

95
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,197
You had no right to tell me
you had feelings for me.

96
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,066
I was doing great with Julie
before I found out.

97
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:53,972
I was doing great too. It's not
easy for me to see you with Julie.

98
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,875
I don't need this right now.

99
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,842
It's too late.

100
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,020
I'm with somebody else.
This ship has sailed!

101
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,689
All right, fine!
Go ahead and do that.

102
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,257
I don't need your stupid ship!

103
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:59,400
This is the first time I'm doing
something I care about.

104
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:03,206
I'm doing something
that I'm actually good at.

105
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,814
If you don't get that

106
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:09,053
I get that, but I'm tired
of your answering machine.

107
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,722
I don't know what to do.

108
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:12,948
Neither do l!

109
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,585
Is this about Mark?

110
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:17,384
Oh, my God!

111
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,427
Okay, it's not.

112
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,397
I can't keep having this
same fight over and over again.

113
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,264
You're making this too hard!

114
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,633
I am?
What do you want me to do?

115
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,777
I don't know. Look, maybe
we should just take a break.

116
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,947
You're right. Let's cool off.

117
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,810
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.

118
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,316
A break from us.

119
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:51,828
-Why are we rushing?
-The girlfriend I told you about.

120
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,091
She wants to get back
together with me.

121
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,257
I found it!

122
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,595
That's so great for you guys!

123
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:02,798
-Good luck with your girlfriend.
-Thank you.

124
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,877
-You got my message?
-You are right on time.

125
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,519
Can I be your girlfriend again?

126
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,213
You can very much.

127
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,960
I want you to leave.
Get out!

128
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,028
I want to talk about this.

129
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,497
All right, how was she?

130
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,668
-What?
-Was she good?

131
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:37,865
Don't answer!

132
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:43,579
You wanted to talk about it.
How was she?

133
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,906
She was....

134
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,747
-She was not good, not good.
-Nothing compared to you.

135
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:51,645
She was different.

136
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,384
Good different?

137
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,728
Nobody likes change.

138
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,697
Just stop!

139
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,628
The way you owned up to everything.

140
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,204
It's just showed me
how much you've grown, you know?

141
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,578
I mean, my mom never thought
this would work out.

142
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,943
She was all,
"Once a cheater, always a cheater."

143
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,391
I just wish we hadn't lost
those four months.

144
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:31,392
But if time was what you needed
just to gain a little perspective.

145
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:37,229
We were on a break!

146
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,505
You seem to really like her.

147
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,446
What do I do?
We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.

148
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,550
No commitment.

149
00:10:56,155 --> 00:11:00,785
That girl just spent the entire evening
talking to your friends...

150
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,460
...asking to hear stories about you...

151
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,323
...Iooking through
Monica's photo albums.

152
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,659
You don't do that
if you're just in it for two weeks.

153
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,496
You think?

154
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:16,234
You've got 14 hours until
she has to be at the airport.

155
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,807
And you're sitting here
in a hallway...

156
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,242
...with a 28-year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.

157
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,081
-You're right.
-Yeah.

158
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,657
This is so amazing!

159
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,133
My brother's getting married
and in London!

160
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,363
It's so romantic.

161
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,700
Hey, pretty smart!

162
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:52,935
Tissue paper.

163
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,680
You're at the wedding.
You have to cry.

164
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,281
Handkerchief?
No, I got my invitation.

165
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,243
Isn't this adorable?

166
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,049
Ross let Ben address mine.

167
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,127
Did you get your invitation
to Ross' wedding?

168
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,289
No.

169
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,366
Don't worry, I get to bring a guest.
We'll show him.

170
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,530
I'm so jealous you're all going.

171
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,902
I never knew you can't fly
in your third trimester.

172
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,201
I didn't, either.

173
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,070
I knew that.

174
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,246
So I didn't know that.
But you should see your faces.

175
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,406
What's up?

176
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,080
Just hanging out.

177
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,426
What's this?
Ross' wedding invitation?

178
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,122
Maybe that's the one
we should have hidden.

179
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:51,030
No, you guys, come on.
You don't have to do that.

180
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,034
I'm happy for him.

181
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,934
I am. I really

182
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,575
I'll work on it.

183
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,767
I'm sorry.

184
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,942
You're going to come, though,
aren't you?

185
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,776
I don't know.

186
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,622
This isn't one of those
"lf she doesn't come, we don't come"?

187
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,381
-I bought my ticket.
-You're not even invited.

188
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,488
You know what would be real weird?
If you weren't there.

189
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,926
-Just say you'll think about it.
-I'll think about it.

190
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,599
-Who's this from?
-That's Ross'.

191
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,442
Oh, my God!

192
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:39,845
He remembered.

193
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,276
Remembered what?

194
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:45,418
It was months ago.
We were walking by this antique store.

195
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,185
I saw this and told him
it was like one my grandmother had...

196
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,760
...when I was a little girl.

197
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,158
I can't believe he remembered!

198
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,891
This must've cost a fortune.

199
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,295
I can't believe he did this.

200
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,165
Remember when he fell in love
with Carol...

201
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,466
...and got her
that expensive crystal duck?

202
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:05,801
What did you just say?

203
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,983
Oh, my God!

204
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,427
Flight number 457
from Beijing now arriving.

205
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,655
Oh, my God!

206
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,701
-We were in school together.
-We haven't seen each other since.

207
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:35,703
I land in China.
Guess who's in charge of the dig?

208
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,033
Julie!

209
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,144
Isn't that great?

210
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,979
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

211
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,420
That is so sweet!

212
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,921
No, you hang up.

213
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,719
No, you

214
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,166
One, two, three.

215
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,598
You didn't hang up!

216
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,738
She didn't hang up either.

217
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,402
Okay, no. No, you hang up.

218
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,910
You!

219
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,114
Ross, hi.

220
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,581
It's Rachel.

221
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:29,393
I'm just calling to say
that everything's fine.

222
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,862
And I'm really happy for you...

223
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,198
...and your cat.

224
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,894
Obviously, I am over you.

225
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,233
I am over you.

226
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:48,469
And that, my friend,
is what they call closure.

227
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,046
I got a message from you.

228
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,753
Oh, my God!
Hang up the phone!

229
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,989
Give me the phone!

230
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,830
You're over me?

231
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,465
Oh, God.

232
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,564
You're over me?

233
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,433
When were you...

234
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,338
...under me?

235
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,744
Basically...

236
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,975
...Iately, I've....

237
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,584
I've sort of had feelings for you.

238
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:33,751
I need to lie down.

239
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,629
He broke up with Julie!

240
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,360
Go hug her, for God's sakes!

241
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,160
-Really?
-Really.

242
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,702
It's always been you, Rach.

243
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,202
Oh, God.

244
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,117
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to work tonight.

245
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,454
That's okay.

246
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,520
You're worth the wait.

247
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,853
And I don't just mean tonight.

248
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,052
Oh, God!

249
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,517
Honey.

250
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,352
That's okay.

251
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,885
No, you just rolled over
the juice box.

252
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:53,636
Did you say anything to Rachel about
me and the girl from the copy place?

253
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,570
I'm sorry.

254
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,742
Was I not supposed to?

255
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,242
You ended it!

256
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:10,411
Because I was mad at you.
Not because I stopped loving you.

257
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,784
You still love me?

258
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:20,531
What does this mean?
Do you want to get back together?

259
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,761
Maybe.

260
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,695
I don't know.

261
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,967
I just, I feel....

262
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:42,478
I can't believe I even thought of
getting back together. We're so over!

263
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,151
Fine by me!

264
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,919
And hey! Just so you know,
it's not that common.

265
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:54,792
It doesn't happen to every guy,
and it is a big deal.

266
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,598
I knew it!

267
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,376
Rachel's coming up.
Doesn't she look pretty?

268
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,984
Oh, my God!

269
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,212
This is us getting ready
for the prom.

270
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,114
We don't have to watch this.

271
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,281
Yeah, we do!

272
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,618
Come on!

273
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:26,358
-Get a shot of Monica.
-How do you zoom out?

274
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,395
There she is!

275
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:33,036
Shut up!
The camera adds 10 pounds.

276
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,832
So how many cameras
are actually on you?

277
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,872
Dad, turn it off!

278
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,372
It is off.

279
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,069
Right, Ross?

280
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,913
Looking good, Mr. Kotter!

281
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:55,216
I can't go to my prom without a date.
It's too late.

282
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,725
If you're not going,
then I don't want to go either.

283
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,965
I have a wonderful idea.

284
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,396
You should take Rachel to the prom.

285
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,364
We've seen enough.
Let's turn it off.

286
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,663
-I want to see!
-Fine, I'm not going to watch.

287
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,033
Come on, kid. Let's go.

288
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,906
Are you handsome!

289
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,703
Let's show them!

290
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,385
-Okay, Dad.
-Rachel, ready or not.

291
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,087
Here comes your knight in shining

292
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,821
Oh, dear!

293
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,757
How do I turn this off?

294
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,161
I can't believe you did that.

295
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,770
Yeah, well....

296
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,590
See? He's her lobster!

297
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,961
No.

298
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,406
You're really not going?

299
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,873
It's just going to be too hard.

300
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,470
You know, I mean...

301
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,544
...it's Ross.

302
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,809
How can I watch him get married?

303
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,417
It's just for the best.
You know? It is.

304
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,352
Plus somebody's got
to stay here with Phoebe.

305
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,357
She's going to be pretty big by then.

306
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,156
She'll need someone
to help her tie her shoes.

307
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,994
Drive her to the hospital
if she goes into labor.

308
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,561
You don't have a car.

309
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,706
And your license expired.

310
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,706
There's so much to do,
and I have so little time!

311
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,349
Check this out.

312
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:04,010
There's a place you can go
to rent videos of all the museums.

313
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:07,055
"It's almost as good as being there."

314
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:10,987
It's better! You can't go to a museum
in your underwear.

315
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,395
You could, but just the one time.

316
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,662
We could get videos
of the sights...

317
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,431
...get a VCR in our hotel room
and never have to go outside!

318
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:29,537
-lf we do that, we've got to rent Die Hard.
-I bet the British version is good!
