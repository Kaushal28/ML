1
00:00:03,168 --> 00:00:07,768
-It's not fair. It's my money.
-I know, but it's what Bread wanted.

2
00:00:08,168 --> 00:00:10,836
-Ok, which one is she?
-That's Bread's widow.

3
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:14,068
-Why she didn't upset?
-Because she just find out and cut the wire.

4
00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:23,068
-Didn't she find out she can't define the money.
-No.

5
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,037
-Oh, Drake.
-I'm sorry, Amber.

6
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:31,831
It's like Brad to have
to have the last word.

7
00:00:32,842 --> 00:00:34,400
Sorry I'm late.
What happened?

8
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:35,769
We wanna see the end.

9
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:37,440
I want you, Drake.

10
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:38,873
I know you do.

11
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,242
But we can never
be together that way.

12
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:42,781
What?

13
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:45,044
There's something I never told you.

14
00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:48,085
I'm actually your half-brother.

15
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:54,962
So what happens next?

16
00:00:55,364 --> 00:00:58,663
I get the medical award
for separating the Siamese twins.

17
00:00:58,868 --> 00:01:03,202
Then Amber and I go to Venezuela
to meet our other half-brother, Ramon...

18
00:01:04,407 --> 00:01:08,207
...where I find the world's
biggest emerald. It's really big.

19
00:01:08,411 --> 00:01:10,242
But it's cursed.

20
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:11,776
So cool!

21
00:01:12,048 --> 00:01:13,811
God, that is good TV!

22
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:18,211
The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies

23
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:05,294
Pheebs, play with me!

24
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:07,999
This game is grotesque!

25
00:02:08,236 --> 00:02:12,138
Twenty armless guys joined
at the waist by a steel bar...

26
00:02:12,474 --> 00:02:15,466
...forced to play soccer forever?

27
00:02:15,977 --> 00:02:18,070
Hello? Human rights violation!

28
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:21,108
Don't feel so bad.
After playing...

29
00:02:21,316 --> 00:02:25,275
...I break out the plastic women
and everybody has a good time.

30
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:29,016
Why don't you play with your roommate?

31
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:32,626
He's not a big fan of foosball.

32
00:02:32,827 --> 00:02:35,591
Are we not getting along
with the new boy?

33
00:02:35,797 --> 00:02:39,699
No, he's all right. He spends
most of his time in his room.

34
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:42,436
That's because you haven't
gotten to know him.

35
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,262
Let's remedy that, shall we?

36
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,674
-We don't need to.
-lt'll be fun!

37
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:50,941
What was that?

38
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:56,682
I thought it'd be fun if we had
beers and got to know each other.

39
00:02:57,185 --> 00:02:58,049
All right.

40
00:02:58,286 --> 00:02:59,947
Oh, good! Okay.

41
00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:04,649
Oh, no! I have to go,
because I'm late for...

42
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,986
... my Green Eggs and Ham
discussion group.

43
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,832
Tonight, it's "Why he would not
eat them on a train."

44
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,661
-Have fun! Bye!
-That was so lame.

45
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:16,200
I know.

46
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,470
Okay, talk to him.

47
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:27,247
So you think that Speed Racer guy
gets a lot of tickets or...?

48
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:32,819
That's good.
So who broke up with who?

49
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:34,146
I broke up with her.

50
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:37,916
She actually thought Sean Penn
was the capital of Cambodia.

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,659
When everybody knows that
the capital of Cambodia is....

52
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,529
It's not Sean Penn.

53
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:48,867
I got a funny one.

54
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:53,597
My last girlfriend, Tilly.
We're eating breakfast, right?

55
00:03:53,807 --> 00:03:56,207
I made these pancakes.
Like, 50 pancakes.

56
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,470
All of a sudden,
she turns to me and says, "Eddie...

57
00:03:59,713 --> 00:04:01,613
... I don't wanna see you anymore."

58
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:04,749
It was literally like she had
reached into my chest...

59
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:08,318
... ripped out my heart
and smeared it all over my life!

60
00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:12,423
There was this incredible abyss
and I'm falling.

61
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:16,390
I keep falling and
I don't think I'm ever gonna stop!

62
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:22,725
That wasn't such a funny story.

63
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,807
And a crusty old man
Said I'll do what I can

64
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:32,409
And the rest of the rats
Played maracas

65
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:37,277
That's it! Thanks! Good night.

66
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,147
Phoebe's got another job, right?

67
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,253
Great set tonight, Pheebs.

68
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:45,619
I know.

69
00:04:46,627 --> 00:04:47,958
We should get going.

70
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:51,494
We should too.
I've got patients at 8 in the morning.

71
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:53,963
You know how we always stay
at your apartment?

72
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:56,432
I thought tonight
we'd stay at my place.

73
00:04:56,971 --> 00:04:59,132
I don't know.
I don't have my jammies.

74
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,005
You don't need them.

75
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:05,103
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.

76
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:07,974
Shut up. I'm happy.

77
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:12,849
Oh, this is so nice!
I have to make a speech.

78
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:18,185
Of all the guys that Monica has
been with, and that is a lot...

79
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:22,722
...I like you the best.

80
00:05:23,397 --> 00:05:26,059
Thank you, Pheebs.
That's very sweet.

81
00:05:26,634 --> 00:05:27,726
You hear that?

82
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:31,493
She likes me best. And apparently,
there have been a lot.

83
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:34,399
Not a lot.

84
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:37,143
Phoebe's kidding. Phoebe's crazy.

85
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,677
Phoebe's dead.

86
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,379
I'm looking for Eddie Manoick.

87
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:52,254
He's not here right now.
I'm Chandler.

88
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:55,360
Can I take a message or....
Or a fish tank?

89
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,723
Thanks.

90
00:05:57,265 --> 00:05:58,596
Come on in.

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,058
I'm Tilly.

92
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:09,169
I gather by that "Oh,"
he told you about me.

93
00:06:09,377 --> 00:06:12,210
Yeah, your name came up...

94
00:06:12,446 --> 00:06:15,938
...in a conversation that
terrified me to my very soul.

95
00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:18,716
He's kind of intense.

96
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,718
Yes! Hey, can I ask you,
is Eddie a little...

97
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:22,854
A little what?

98
00:06:23,057 --> 00:06:24,581
...bit country?

99
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:30,581
You know, a little rock and roll.

100
00:06:32,995 --> 00:06:34,360
Come on in, you roomie!

101
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:36,895
Hello, Tilly.

102
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:39,533
Eddie, I just came by
to drop off your tank.

103
00:06:40,035 --> 00:06:41,935
That was very thoughtful of you.

104
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:43,661
It's very thoughtful.

105
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,534
Well, okay then.

106
00:06:50,246 --> 00:06:52,214
I'm gonna go. Bye.

107
00:06:56,685 --> 00:06:57,777
So we getting a fish?

108
00:06:58,587 --> 00:06:59,747
You had sex with her.

109
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:05,686
Check it out, check it out!

110
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:10,058
Soap Opera Digest!
That's one of my favorite digests!

111
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:14,024
Page 42! Page 42!

112
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:19,802
"New Doc on the Block,
Days of our Lives Joey Tribbiani."

113
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:21,737
Cool picture!

114
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:23,972
Oh, I look good.

115
00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:28,981
Is this true? That you write
a lot of your own lines?

116
00:07:29,618 --> 00:07:31,108
Well, kind of, yeah.

117
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:35,322
Remember last week
when Alex was in the accident?

118
00:07:35,557 --> 00:07:37,354
The line in the script was...

119
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,995
... "If we don't get this woman
to a hospital, she's going to die."

120
00:07:41,297 --> 00:07:44,266
But I made it, "If this woman
doesn't get to a hospital...

121
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:46,400
...she's not gonna live."

122
00:07:48,003 --> 00:07:51,461
Oh, okay.
I see what you did there.

123
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:58,002
Aren't you afraid the writers will be
kind of mad when they read this?

124
00:07:59,748 --> 00:08:04,082
I never thought about the writers.
The scripts just come to my house.

125
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:08,354
But you know what?

126
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,991
This makes me look good,
which makes the show look good...

127
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:15,924
...which makes the writers look good.
So how could they be mad?

128
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:19,458
Makes up most of his lines.

129
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:20,930
Son of a....

130
00:08:23,872 --> 00:08:25,669
Write this, jerk-weed.

131
00:08:25,874 --> 00:08:27,603
I fall down an elevator shaft?

132
00:08:27,843 --> 00:08:30,812
What does this mean?
I fall down an elevator shaft?

133
00:08:31,013 --> 00:08:34,471
I don't know.
I just bring the scripts.

134
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:39,454
They can't kill me!
I'm Francesca's long-lost son!

135
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:41,346
Right.

136
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:43,658
Could you sign?

137
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:46,827
No! No way! I'm not signing that!

138
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:50,294
I don't think that will affect
the plot of the show.

139
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:53,728
How can they do this to me?

140
00:08:56,705 --> 00:08:59,071
All right, I'm just gonna go.

141
00:08:59,842 --> 00:09:00,866
Sorry.

142
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:09,208
Well, it wasn't that many guys.

143
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:12,353
If you consider how many guys
there actually are...

144
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:14,552
...it's a very small percentage.

145
00:09:15,324 --> 00:09:18,054
It's not that big a deal.
I was just curious.

146
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:19,988
-Good night.
-Good night, Richard.

147
00:09:20,229 --> 00:09:22,060
Good luck, Mon.

148
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:26,530
Before I tell you, you tell me
how many women you've been with.

149
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:29,569
Two.

150
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:32,166
Two? Two?

151
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:35,402
How is that possible? I mean...

152
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:37,704
... have you seen you?

153
00:09:39,848 --> 00:09:41,213
I mean, what can I say?

154
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,614
I was married to Barbara for 30 years,
my high-school sweetheart.

155
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:47,788
Now you. That's two.

156
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:49,947
Two it is.

157
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,223
Time for bed.
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

158
00:09:54,296 --> 00:09:55,957
No, wait a minute now!

159
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:57,927
Come on, it's your turn.

160
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,963
Oh, come on!

161
00:10:01,236 --> 00:10:04,933
You know, I don't need the
actual number. Just a ballpark.

162
00:10:06,442 --> 00:10:09,468
Okay, it is definitely
less than a ballpark.

163
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:16,649
I am so glad
I'm not Monica right now.

164
00:10:16,952 --> 00:10:18,613
Tell me about it.

165
00:10:18,887 --> 00:10:21,447
So what's your magic number?

166
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:28,559
Come on, you know everyone
I've been with. All both of them.

167
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:31,497
Well, there's you.

168
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:33,730
Better not be doing these in order.

169
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:39,301
Billy Dreskin, Pete Carny.

170
00:10:39,842 --> 00:10:40,968
Barry.

171
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:43,107
Paolo.

172
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:46,471
Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.

173
00:10:48,317 --> 00:10:51,912
Honey, are you jealous of Paolo?

174
00:10:52,154 --> 00:10:55,749
I'm so much happier with you
than I ever was with him.

175
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,983
-Really?
-Oh, please!

176
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,252
That Paolo thing was
barely a relationship.

177
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,157
All it really was
was just meaningless, animal sex.

178
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:14,004
Okay, you know, that sounded
so much better in my head.

179
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,440
I didn't sleep with
your ex-girlfriend.

180
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:20,877
That's exactly what someone
who slept with her would say.

181
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:24,277
This is nuts! Crazy!
She came over for two minutes...

182
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,681
...dropped off a fish tank and left!

183
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:27,886
Where's Buddy?

184
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:29,287
Buddy?

185
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,156
My fish, Buddy.

186
00:11:32,227 --> 00:11:34,491
There was no fish
when she dropped it off.

187
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,391
This is unbelievable!

188
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:41,125
You sleep with my ex-girlfriend,
insult my intelligence by lying...

189
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,304
...then you kill my fish?
My Buddy?

190
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:45,332
I didn't kill your fish!

191
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:47,370
Look, Eddie

192
00:11:50,812 --> 00:11:53,007
Would you look at what I'm doing?

193
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:55,016
Now that can't be smart.

194
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:01,579
So we're just gonna
take this guy right off you...

195
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:04,314
...and put him here in Mr. Pocket.

196
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:07,692
Tangelo?

197
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:21,233
That's it? That's the giant number
you were afraid to tell me?

198
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,569
Well, that's not bad at all.

199
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:26,508
You had me thinking it was,
like, a fleet.

200
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,974
You're okay with it?

201
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:30,913
Oh, honey, I'm fine.

202
00:12:35,657 --> 00:12:37,488
Okay, about that two.

203
00:12:37,926 --> 00:12:38,984
What?

204
00:12:39,194 --> 00:12:40,183
All right.

205
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:42,255
What about my two?

206
00:12:42,464 --> 00:12:45,126
It just seems like
a really small number.

207
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:46,358
Right.

208
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:51,806
Don't you have a lot
of wild oats to sow?

209
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:56,808
Or is that what you're doing with me?
Oh, my God! Am I an oat?

210
00:12:57,713 --> 00:12:59,476
Honey, you are not an oat.

211
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:03,482
I don't know, I guess
I'm just not an oat guy.

212
00:13:03,686 --> 00:13:05,654
I've only slept with women I love.

213
00:13:06,255 --> 00:13:08,018
You've only slept with two people.

214
00:13:13,028 --> 00:13:14,017
Right.

215
00:13:22,037 --> 00:13:24,096
You know I love you too, right?

216
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:26,668
Now I do.

217
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:35,108
Ross, please listen to me.

218
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:38,343
You are so much better for me
than Paolo ever was.

219
00:13:38,587 --> 00:13:41,613
You care about me, you're loving,
you make me laugh.

220
00:13:41,924 --> 00:13:44,358
If I make you laugh, here's an idea.

221
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:46,686
Invite Paolo to have
a romp in the sack...

222
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:49,955
...and I'll stand in the corner
and tell knock-knock jokes!

223
00:13:53,469 --> 00:13:56,529
What we have is special!
All Paolo and I ever had was

224
00:13:56,772 --> 00:13:57,932
"Animal sex"?

225
00:14:01,276 --> 00:14:02,937
So what are you saying?

226
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:06,113
There's nothing between us
"animal" at all?

227
00:14:06,382 --> 00:14:10,250
There's not even,
like, a little animal?

228
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:12,078
Not even, like...

229
00:14:12,454 --> 00:14:13,716
...chipmunk sex?

230
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,223
Try to hear me, okay?

231
00:14:20,462 --> 00:14:22,555
I'm not gonna lie to you.

232
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:26,464
-lt was good with Paolo.
-Knock-knock.

233
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:31,672
But what you and I have
is so much better.

234
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:36,274
We have tenderness,
we have intimacy, we connect.

235
00:14:36,478 --> 00:14:37,945
You know? I swear.

236
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,273
This is the best...

237
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:43,178
... I have ever had.

238
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:45,683
Until now.

239
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,920
Richard told me he loved me.

240
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:57,256
-Oh, my God!
-I know!

241
00:14:57,499 --> 00:14:58,830
Honey, that's great!

242
00:14:59,034 --> 00:15:00,262
I know!

243
00:15:00,469 --> 00:15:02,164
-I just can't find
-Top drawer.

244
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:05,033
-Hurry.
-Why? You need one too?

245
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:08,942
Found them!

246
00:15:13,615 --> 00:15:14,513
There's only one.

247
00:15:17,853 --> 00:15:21,721
We'll be right there.
We're just trying to decide something.

248
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:43,209
-They're trying to decide something.
-Good. Good, good.

249
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:53,749
So was your mustache
Did it used to be different?

250
00:16:00,863 --> 00:16:03,855
How do you, you know,
keep it so neat?

251
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:06,698
I have a comb.

252
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,371
-What is that?
-A mustache comb.

253
00:16:13,575 --> 00:16:14,906
Thank you.

254
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:20,112
Okay, I will do your laundry
for one month.

255
00:16:22,684 --> 00:16:24,345
I will, I will, I will....

256
00:16:24,553 --> 00:16:27,215
I will clean the apartment
for two months.

257
00:16:27,456 --> 00:16:31,722
I'll give this to you now, if you
tell me where we keep the dustpan.

258
00:16:41,537 --> 00:16:43,095
So were you in Nam?

259
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:53,095
We are both adults here.
We must got some way to solve this.

260
00:16:53,743 --> 00:16:55,938
-Rock, paper, scissors?
-Gotcha.

261
00:16:56,546 --> 00:16:58,275
One, two, three.

262
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:00,038
Yes!

263
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,577
Fine. Go have sex.

264
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:08,421
No! You have got it completely wrong!

265
00:17:08,624 --> 00:17:11,491
John Savage was Deer Hunter,
no legs.

266
00:17:11,727 --> 00:17:14,594
Jon Voight was Coming Home,
couldn't feel his legs.

267
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:18,960
You've got it totally the other way
around, my friend. Jon Voight

268
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:20,999
-Honey?
-What?

269
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:30,442
Shall we?

270
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:32,079
It's not gonna happen.

271
00:17:32,348 --> 00:17:35,613
They're doing it tonight.
We can do it tomorrow.

272
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:41,853
In the future, if I could see
the schedule beforehand....

273
00:17:45,628 --> 00:17:47,425
So when I woke up this morning...

274
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,758
... he'd stolen all the insoles
out of my shoes!

275
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:52,099
Why?

276
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:56,169
He thinks I slept with his
ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.

277
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:58,202
Why would you kill his fish?

278
00:18:01,644 --> 00:18:04,272
Because sometimes
after you sleep with someone...

279
00:18:04,513 --> 00:18:06,879
...you have to kill a fish.

280
00:18:09,018 --> 00:18:10,383
Chandler, honey...

281
00:18:10,653 --> 00:18:11,779
... I'm sorry.

282
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:14,320
Can we watch Joey's show now, please?

283
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:16,347
Wait. He's not here yet.

284
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,117
He knows what happens.

285
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:22,530
I'm fine about my problem now,
by the way.

286
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:26,963
Amber...

287
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:30,003
...I'll always be there for you...

288
00:18:30,206 --> 00:18:32,367
...as a friend and as your brother.

289
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:34,499
Oh, Drake.

290
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:36,508
Hard day, huh?

291
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:39,214
First the medical award, now this?

292
00:18:39,682 --> 00:18:41,980
Some guys are just lucky, I guess.

293
00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:46,382
Dr. Ramoray, report to
first floor Emergency stat.

294
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:49,715
Well, then...

295
00:18:50,926 --> 00:18:52,655
... I guess that's me.

296
00:18:55,097 --> 00:18:58,999
Anyone else need to go on the elevator?
Dr. Horton? Dr. Wall?

297
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:01,735
They only said you.

298
00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:06,531
Oh, okay. All right.

299
00:19:06,842 --> 00:19:07,706
I love you.

300
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:09,335
Yeah, whatever.

301
00:19:10,746 --> 00:19:11,770
Oh, no!

302
00:19:12,014 --> 00:19:13,345
Drake, look out!

303
00:19:17,953 --> 00:19:20,251
-Did they just kill off Joey?
-No!

304
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:24,420
Now maybe.

305
00:19:25,961 --> 00:19:29,055
Come on! Open up!
We want to talk to you!

306
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:30,698
I don't feel like talking!

307
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:32,696
Come on! We care about you.

308
00:19:33,035 --> 00:19:37,131
-We're worried about you.
-And some of us really have to pee!

309
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,800
I'm sorry, Joey.

310
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,416
Listen, sorry about your death.
That really sucks.

311
00:19:49,118 --> 00:19:52,417
-We came over as soon as we saw.
-How could you not tell us?

312
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:56,421
I don't know. I was kind of hoping
no one would ever find out.

313
00:19:57,827 --> 00:20:00,921
Well, maybe they could find
a way to bring you back.

314
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:06,265
They said that when they found my body,
my brain was so smashed in...

315
00:20:06,502 --> 00:20:10,097
...that the only doctor
who could've saved me was me.

316
00:20:11,907 --> 00:20:14,137
It's supposed to be
some kind of irony.

317
00:20:16,112 --> 00:20:17,807
But Joey, you're gonna be fine.

318
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:21,449
You don't need that show.
It was just a dumb soap opera.

319
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,813
This was the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

320
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,682
Yes! I was going to incorporate that.

321
00:20:29,158 --> 00:20:32,252
Here's Monica.
She'll have something nice to say.

322
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:37,321
I straightened out your shower curtain
so you won't get mildew.

323
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:40,362
What? To me, that's nice.

324
00:20:41,837 --> 00:20:43,771
It'll be okay. You know that.

325
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:46,000
No, I don't.

326
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:50,642
It's like you work
your whole life for something...

327
00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:52,973
...and you think
that when you get it...

328
00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:55,547
...it'll never be
as good as you thought.

329
00:20:55,818 --> 00:20:57,513
But this so was.

330
00:20:57,953 --> 00:20:59,477
It changed everything.

331
00:20:59,722 --> 00:21:02,885
Like, the other day,
I got this credit card application...

332
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:05,456
...and I was pre-approved!

333
00:21:07,997 --> 00:21:11,364
I've never been pre-approved
for anything in my life!

334
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:13,125
I'm sorry, man.

335
00:21:13,335 --> 00:21:16,634
I don't know if this'll mean
anything to you...

336
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:19,467
... but you'll always be
pre-approved with us.

337
00:21:20,743 --> 00:21:22,404
That means nothing to me.

338
00:21:29,985 --> 00:21:31,816
Pecan sandy? Just made them.

339
00:21:33,489 --> 00:21:34,854
Yeah, all right.

340
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:37,490
Are these raisins?

341
00:21:38,961 --> 00:21:39,791
Sure, why not?

342
00:21:47,202 --> 00:21:48,533
Listen, Eddie.

343
00:21:50,172 --> 00:21:52,640
I've been thinking about
our living situation.

344
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:54,741
Why are you smiling?

345
00:21:55,177 --> 00:21:58,340
I got a little surprise.
Look. There's a new fishy.

346
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:00,412
I named him...

347
00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:03,174
... Chandler, you know, after you.

348
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:15,091

349
00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:18,865
No, that's a Goldfish cracker.

350
00:22:20,736 --> 00:22:22,397

00:22:26,575 --> 00:22:28,440
Okay, good night.

352
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:31,778
You big freak of nature!

353
00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:00,402

-Oh, man.

354
00:23:01,443 --> 00:23:03,934
-Let's never speak of this.
-You got it.
