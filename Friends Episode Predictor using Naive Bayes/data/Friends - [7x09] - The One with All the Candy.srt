1
00:00:05,117 --> 00:00:07,517
-I'm ready.
-You sure?

2
00:00:07,819 --> 00:00:10,481
Let me just straighten out
your heImet there.

3
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:14,352
-Thanks, Daddy.
-No, no. One daddy, two mommies.

4
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:19,053
-AII right, it's aII yours.
-Okay, okay.

5
00:00:19,298 --> 00:00:21,061
There you go, there you go.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,259
Wow, Ben's first big-kid's bike.
This is so e<i>x</i>citing!

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,404
Oh, yeah, I remember mine.

8
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:30,130
It was my si<i>x</i>th birthday.
I went to the park...

9
00:00:30,342 --> 00:00:33,800
-...and I got on it, and it bent.
-Yeah.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,474
-I never had a bike of my own.
-What?

11
00:00:37,683 --> 00:00:39,480
We didn't have a Iot of money.

12
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:42,415
But the girI across the street
had the best bike.

13
00:00:42,654 --> 00:00:47,057
It was pink, and it had rainbow-coIored
tasseIs hanging off the handIes...

14
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:50,295
...and a beII
and this big, white wicker basket...

15
00:00:50,529 --> 00:00:53,521
...with those
pIastic daisies stuck on.

16
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:56,330
That sounds Iike my first bike.

17
00:00:57,803 --> 00:00:59,566
My dad gave me his oId one.

18
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:02,900
-Did the girI ever Iet you ride it?
-No.

19
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:05,508
But she gave me the bo<i>x</i>
that it came in.

20
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:09,105
It had a picture of the bike
on the front.

21
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:13,615
So I wouId sit on it, and my stepdad
wouId drag me around the backyard.

22
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:16,046
That is so unfair.

23
00:01:16,388 --> 00:01:19,255
Not reaIIy, I got
to drag him around too.

24
00:01:20,192 --> 00:01:22,387
The One With AII the Candy

25
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:04,731
Hey, what are you guys doing?

26
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,029
Making candy for the neighbors.

27
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:08,530
I'm sorry, who?

28
00:02:10,075 --> 00:02:12,168
I'm gonna hang
a basket on the door.

29
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:15,346
When the neighbors waIk by,
they can take a piece.

30
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:19,239
-But we don't know the neighbors.
-I do.

31
00:02:19,418 --> 00:02:22,353
There's, Iet's see,
the guy with the mustache...

32
00:02:22,554 --> 00:02:25,887
...smokes-a-Iot Iady,
some kids I've seen...

33
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:30,151
...and a red-haired guy
who does not Iike to be caIIed Rusty.

34
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:33,928
Oh, I know that guy.
He aIso doesn't Iike it when you say:

35
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,329
''Back off, Howdy Doody. I'm engaged.''

36
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,367
You got hit on by Firebeard?

37
00:02:40,572 --> 00:02:43,268
See, this is e<i>x</i>actIy why
I'm making this candy.

38
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:45,443
We can get to know our neighbors.

39
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:48,010
WouIdn't it be easier
if we just moved?

40
00:02:50,649 --> 00:02:52,844
Good morning!

41
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:56,418
-Somebody's in a good mood.
-WeII, why shouIdn't I be?

42
00:02:56,621 --> 00:02:59,613
I have great friends.
I have a wonderfuI job--

43
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:02,851
Where you can make out
with your assistant.

44
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:04,255
It's not a big deaI.

45
00:03:04,463 --> 00:03:08,490
We stayed up aII night creating a pIan
so that us dating won't be a probIem.

46
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:10,497
Oh, yeah? What's the pIan?

47
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:17,170
We-- We are not...

48
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:20,110
...going to Iet it...

49
00:03:20,312 --> 00:03:21,973
...be a probIem.

50
00:03:22,914 --> 00:03:26,008
It took you aII night
to come up with that pIan?

51
00:03:26,218 --> 00:03:28,652
WeII, you know,
we did other stuff too.

52
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:31,077
Did you two...?

53
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:33,849
Oh, I don't sIeep with guys
on the first date.

54
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:36,720
-Matt Wire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wise--
-Anymore!

55
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:47,035
Hi, Tag, I have a conference caII
today, is that correct?

56
00:03:47,272 --> 00:03:50,298
-Yes, at 4.
-Okay, thank you, that'II be aII.

57
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:53,000
Wait, wait.

58
00:03:56,615 --> 00:03:59,049
Did you see that?
He had no idea...

59
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:01,777
...there was something
going on between us.

60
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,152
-I'd better get back to my desk.
-Okay, hard worker.

61
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,157
I'II put that in your evaIuation.

62
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:19,265
-My what?
-You've been here for two months now.

63
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:23,167
And your boss is re<i>q</i>uired to hand in
a performance evaIuation.

64
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:27,243
But you know, there is one thing
that I have yet to evaIuate.

65
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:38,212
-Are you serious?
-No, I've just aIways wanted to do that.

66
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,755
Can you heIp me cIean this up?

67
00:04:45,597 --> 00:04:48,430
-I'm e<i>x</i>cited to see if anyone ate my candy.
-Me too!

68
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,727
-You don't have to do that.
-Thanks.

69
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,101
The basket is totaIIy empty!
The neighbors ate it aII!

70
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:56,774
WeII, either that or....

71
00:04:56,975 --> 00:05:00,570
No. Not even Joey couId eat that much.

72
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:03,475
LittIe refresher, popcorn shrimp night.

73
00:05:04,482 --> 00:05:05,540
Joey!

74
00:05:07,752 --> 00:05:08,776
Yeah?

75
00:05:08,987 --> 00:05:12,115
-Did you eat aII the neighbor candy?
-That was the pIan.

76
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:15,589
When I got to it,
there was onIy a few pieces Ieft.

77
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:17,921
They've come by aII day.
They Iove it.

78
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:20,758
They Iove my candy?

79
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:23,991
-Oh, man, I gotta go make more.
-Hey, Mon.

80
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:29,196
Make some more Iasagna too. Something
might have happened to a chunk of it.

81
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:32,272
Ross, the neighbors ate aII my candy.

82
00:05:32,477 --> 00:05:34,069
Mine stoIe my newspaper.

83
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,837
It's Iike a crime wave.

84
00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:42,213
Pheebs, you got a second?

85
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,580
Sure.

86
00:05:44,322 --> 00:05:46,722
Ever since you toId me
about that bike...

87
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:49,153
...I couIdn't stop thinking about it.

88
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:53,058
I mean, everyone shouId have
a first bike, you know? So....

89
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:59,735
Oh, my God, Ross!

90
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:01,869
-You Iike it?
-I Iove it!

91
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,370
-Yeah?
-Oh, oh, God--

92
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:06,634
And I Iove you.

93
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:08,512
Not that way.

94
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:11,442
But the bike got you a Iot cIoser.

95
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:13,780
WeII, take it downstairs.

96
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:15,883
You know, give it a test drive.

97
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:18,248
Okay. Oh, my God.

98
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:20,623
My first bike!

99
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:23,918
Thank you for the best present
I've ever gotten.

100
00:06:24,562 --> 00:06:26,052
You're weIcome.

101
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,494
Oh, and ChandIer's about to cry.

102
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:33,829
Am not.

103
00:06:34,906 --> 00:06:38,342
Hey, dude, it's okay. It kind of...

104
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,808
...got to me a IittIe too.

105
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,447
I'm just so gIad I couId make her happy.

106
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:46,009
Thanks. I'm gIad I'm not aIone on this.

107
00:06:46,184 --> 00:06:48,379
-Yeah, you are.
-Yeah, you are.

108
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:53,583
Who is that?

109
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:55,916
Don't worry, I'm brave.

110
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:58,459
I-- I am brave.

111
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:01,794
No, no, no, no!

112
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:05,331
Can you teII me who is there, pIease?

113
00:07:06,438 --> 00:07:09,100
My name's Gary. I Iive upstairs.

114
00:07:11,443 --> 00:07:12,740
-Hi.
-Hi.

115
00:07:12,944 --> 00:07:16,175
-Do you know what time it is?
-It's candy time.

116
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:19,976
My roommate says they taste
Iike IittIe drops of heaven.

117
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:22,050
Oh, pIease.

118
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,218
Did you hear that?
''LittIe drops of heaven.''

119
00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:28,349
Four a.m.

120
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:30,787
So can I get some candy?

121
00:07:31,062 --> 00:07:35,260
I am sorry, but some of us
have to get up earIy and go to work.

122
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:39,032
He does not know
that I am not ''some of us.''

123
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:42,535
-He can hear me, can't he?
-Yeah.

124
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:46,300
I'm sorry, but I'II put some out
in the morning.

125
00:07:46,511 --> 00:07:48,877
Okay, I'II swing by Iater.

126
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:50,978
You Iive in this buiIding?

127
00:07:52,183 --> 00:07:54,048
Seems Iike I'd remember you.

128
00:07:57,255 --> 00:07:59,120
Night, Gar.

129
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,295
Is there anybody in this buiIding
that does not hit on you?

130
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:07,693
Smokes-a-Iot Iady.

131
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,465
Oh, wait, that is not true.

132
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,878
So did you read your evaIuation yet?

133
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,416
No, it was marked ''confidentiaI.''

134
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:29,676
I just sent it to human resources.

135
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:36,959
PIease, you're kidding, right?
I wrote that one as a joke for you.

136
00:08:37,228 --> 00:08:39,059
A joke they wouId appreciate?

137
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:41,630
I'm thinking, no.

138
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,703
-What did you say?
-I said you were a good kisser...

139
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:51,239
...and that I Iiked your
teeny, tiny tushy.

140
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,405
No, not my tushy.

141
00:08:54,612 --> 00:08:55,738
It gets worse.

142
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,107
About your initiative, I wrote:

143
00:08:58,316 --> 00:09:01,649
''He was abIe to unhook my bra
with minimaI supervision.''

144
00:09:02,954 --> 00:09:07,516
Under probIems with performance,
I wrote, ''Dear God, I hope not.''

145
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:12,187
And then-- And then I drew
a IittIe smiIey face.

146
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:15,628
And then a smaII pornographic sketch.

147
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:27,711
That is so sweet of you
to get Phoebe that bike.

148
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:30,210
When I heard the story,
I aImost cried.

149
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:31,972
AImost cried, huh?

150
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,582
Hear that, ChandIer? ''AImost'' cried.

151
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,085
Hey, you cry every time
somebody taIks about <i>Titanic</i>.

152
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:41,857
Those two had onIy each other.

153
00:09:43,094 --> 00:09:44,527
She reaIIy Iikes it, huh?

154
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:47,323
Oh, yeah. I saw her
waIking it down the street.

155
00:09:47,532 --> 00:09:50,592
She had these fIowers in the basket.
It was so cute.

156
00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:53,599
I saw her this morning,
waIking it by the park.

157
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:56,531
Wait, she was waIking the bike?

158
00:09:56,741 --> 00:09:58,402
Both times?

159
00:09:59,677 --> 00:10:01,872
-Hey, Pheebs.
-Oh, hi!

160
00:10:02,113 --> 00:10:05,913
-Hey, so you enjoying the bike?
-Oh, so much.

161
00:10:06,618 --> 00:10:11,715
Pheebs, you do know how
to ride a bike, don't you?

162
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,083
Of course.

163
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:18,261
Can we see you ride it?

164
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:20,086
Okay.

165
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:36,046
See?

166
00:10:42,153 --> 00:10:44,951
I toId you not to get
invoIved with your assistant.

167
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:48,523
There's no such thing as a secret
when it comes to affairs.

168
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,519
Did you hear that, ChandIer?

169
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:53,697
No such thing.

170
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,096
What happened? I'm just eating candy.

171
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:03,704
Maybe it's not that bad. They might
not take it the way I meant it.

172
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:07,639
AbsoIuteIy, you know?
Because ''tushy'' can mean both ass...

173
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:09,402
...and good worker.

174
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:13,309
I just gotta get the thing back.

175
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:15,553
Rach? That sketch you mentioned?

176
00:11:15,753 --> 00:11:18,381
Might it have Iooked
a IittIe Iike this?

177
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,553
Oh, my God, Joey!

178
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,760
-What is the matter with you?
-God!

179
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:30,391
This IittIe taIent came in handy
before I couId afford porn.

180
00:11:35,573 --> 00:11:40,010
Hi, I'm sorry. I know it's
after-hours, but I reaIIy need candy.

181
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:43,371
I'm sorry, I can't heIp you.
See? RuIes are ruIes.

182
00:11:43,581 --> 00:11:46,573
PIease, I have peopIe coming
from out of town today.

183
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:49,651
-I toId them aII about your candy.
-You're kidding.

184
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,913
Out-of-towners, huh?
What did you teII them?

185
00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:56,525
I toId them your candy
was absoIuteIy indescribabIe.

186
00:11:56,794 --> 00:12:01,754
Some peopIe have said it's ''IittIe
drops of heaven.'' But whatever.

187
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,359
-PIease, can't you heIp me out?
-Hey, ChandIer, do we know that Iady?

188
00:12:06,571 --> 00:12:10,598
Isn't she the woman who Iives
beIow you and has se<i>x</i> reaIIy Ioud?

189
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:13,037
AII right, I'II do it just this once.

190
00:12:13,311 --> 00:12:16,576
-But you can't teII anyone.
-PIease, just give it to me.

191
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:18,942
Yeah, that's her.

192
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:21,775
-Thank you.
-UnbeIievabIe!

193
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:24,420
I can't beIieve that sign didn't work.

194
00:12:24,622 --> 00:12:27,614
You know what wouId work?
Stop making candy.

195
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,856
But they Iike it.

196
00:12:30,695 --> 00:12:32,128
You mean they Iike you.

197
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:34,522
Maybe.

198
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:38,097
Is that why you became a chef,
so peopIe wouId Iike you?

199
00:12:38,303 --> 00:12:42,364
You want to taIk about getting
peopIe to Iike you, huh, funny man?

200
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:55,314
Just remember everything
I taught you, and you'II be fine.

201
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,283
Okay? Here we go.

202
00:12:57,488 --> 00:12:59,388
Ready, set--

203
00:12:59,557 --> 00:13:02,458
Wait, this seat
is reaIIy uncomfortabIe.

204
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:05,821
Maybe before we start
we shouId just get another one.

205
00:13:06,064 --> 00:13:09,465
Perhaps Iike an airpIane seat,
or a beanbag chair!

206
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:14,565
You can't get out of this.
You have to Iearn how to ride a bike.

207
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:17,673
Why? Why do I have to Iearn?

208
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:23,079
-WeII, in case of an emergency.
-What kind of emergency?

209
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:27,741
WeII, what if a man comes aIong
and puts a gun to your head and says:

210
00:13:27,952 --> 00:13:30,614
''You ride this bike or I'II--

211
00:13:30,922 --> 00:13:33,322
I'II shoot you.''

212
00:13:33,758 --> 00:13:36,090
I wouId ring the beII to distract him.

213
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:39,957
Then I wouId knock the gun away
with a Chinese throwing star.

214
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:44,363
Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike...

215
00:13:44,635 --> 00:13:48,435
...and, hey, I'II hoId you up
and push you. Okay?

216
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:51,334
You won't Iet go?

217
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:52,806
-No.
-You swear?

218
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,272
I swear.

219
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:57,945
-Okay.
-Come on.

220
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:02,510
AII right, here we go. AII right?

221
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,778
-AII right.
-AII right?

222
00:14:03,988 --> 00:14:05,979
FeeI good?
AII right, try pedaIing.

223
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,353
That's it, you're doing great.
Yes, take controI.

224
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:11,858
Yes, yes, yes!

225
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:16,098
Oh, no!

226
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:19,132
You swore!

227
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:24,034
-I just thought you were doing so weII.
-I am shocked. Shocked!

228
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:31,137
It's a Iegitimate Iearning techni<i>q</i>ue.

229
00:14:32,283 --> 00:14:33,648
Wow.

230
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:46,558
Hey, there's some peopIe outside
asking about candy.

231
00:14:46,864 --> 00:14:50,197
They'II just have to wait, won't they?
I onIy got two hands!

232
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:53,762
-Need some heIp?
-No, you don't know the system.

233
00:14:53,971 --> 00:14:56,462
I don't need nobody messing
with the system!

234
00:14:57,308 --> 00:15:01,369
By the way, the week before your
wedding, you may not see a Iot of me.

235
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:13,720
Oh, heIIo, Iiar.

236
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:20,028
Look, I'm reaIIy sorry
I Iet go of the bike.

237
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:22,323
I couId've been kiIIed, you know.

238
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:26,099
I know, I know.

239
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:29,969
But can we pIease try it again?

240
00:15:30,241 --> 00:15:32,573
I mean, you were so cIose, Phoebe.

241
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:35,337
WeII, I wouId Iove to...

242
00:15:36,113 --> 00:15:39,344
...but the bike got stoIen
and the poIice have no suspects.

243
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,087
-Phoebe.
-What?

244
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:52,026
What the heII?

245
00:15:53,531 --> 00:15:54,589
You know what?

246
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:57,927
If you won't Iearn how to ride,
then I'm sorry...

247
00:15:58,135 --> 00:16:00,160
-...I have to take it back.
-What? Why?

248
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:03,739
Because it's....

249
00:16:04,642 --> 00:16:08,009
It'd be Iike you having this guitar...

250
00:16:08,246 --> 00:16:10,009
...and never pIaying it.

251
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:13,148
Okay, this guitar wants to be pIayed.

252
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:16,478
And this bike wants to be ridden.

253
00:16:16,754 --> 00:16:18,984
And if you don't ride it...

254
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:23,284
...you're kiIIing its spirit.

255
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:26,660
The bike...

256
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:29,260
...is dying.

257
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:37,798
AII right. If you care enough
to make up that Ioad of crap, okay.

258
00:16:38,175 --> 00:16:39,699
Great, great.

259
00:16:42,146 --> 00:16:44,171
You're making the bike very happy.

260
00:16:44,382 --> 00:16:45,644
Okay, Ross.

261
00:16:48,553 --> 00:16:50,384
PIease don't die!

262
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:56,549
To get the evaIuation
before they see it...

263
00:16:56,761 --> 00:17:01,323
...we gotta get into ZeIner's office.
He doesn't get in untiI 1 0.

264
00:17:01,532 --> 00:17:05,559
But his assistant, Betty, comes in
earIy to eat breakfast at her desk.

265
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:09,035
-That's kind of sad.
-Yeah, weII, Betty's kind of sad.

266
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,206
Which is why I beIieve I can Iure
her away with these chocoIates.

267
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:16,872
WhiIe I distract her, you go in.

268
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:18,446
-Got it.
-Let's roII.

269
00:17:20,017 --> 00:17:22,247
HeIIo, RacheI. You got a minute?

270
00:17:22,453 --> 00:17:25,786
Yeah, sure, Mr. ZeIner.
For you? Anything. Minute.

271
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,821
Okay, great.

272
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:29,651
Abort the pIan.

273
00:17:30,461 --> 00:17:33,123
ActuaIIy, I'd Iike to speak
to both of you.

274
00:17:33,564 --> 00:17:34,792
Okay.

275
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,360
WeII, can we get you anything,
Mr. ZeIner? Maybe some chocoIates.

276
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:44,670
No, thanks,
but I'II give these to Betty.

277
00:17:46,677 --> 00:17:49,373
So I read your evaIuation of Tag.

278
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:52,980
Or to use his fuII name,
Tag ''Sweet Cheeks'' Jones?

279
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:56,980
Is something going on with you two?

280
00:17:58,489 --> 00:18:02,619
Oh, my God,
can you imagine if there was?

281
00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:07,956
I mean, what wouId happen e<i>x</i>actIy?

282
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:11,624
WeII, I'd be forced to fiIe a report.

283
00:18:11,836 --> 00:18:14,532
I'd have to consuIt
with the IegaI department.

284
00:18:14,772 --> 00:18:18,037
And your future at the company
wouId be in jeopardy.

285
00:18:19,176 --> 00:18:20,768
-WeII--
-Mr. ZeIner....

286
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:23,640
I fiIIed in that evaIuation.

287
00:18:23,848 --> 00:18:25,179
-Oh, no--
-Yeah, yeah.

288
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:27,440
I thought it wouId be funny.

289
00:18:28,653 --> 00:18:31,554
You wrote that you have a cute tushy?

290
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,787
Yes. I have a weird sense of humor.

291
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:39,552
And I'm kind of strangeIy
proud of my butt.

292
00:18:40,998 --> 00:18:43,228
It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.

293
00:18:43,868 --> 00:18:46,564
What is this drawing?
I can't figure it out.

294
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:50,104
It's upside down, you gotta--
It doesn't matter.

295
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:54,000
It's not Iike I don't have
a sense of humor.

296
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:57,806
HeII, I even enjoy a naughty Iimerick
every now and then.

297
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:02,078
There's a time and a pIace.

298
00:19:04,121 --> 00:19:06,817
UnIess you have a Iimerick right now.

299
00:19:09,427 --> 00:19:13,158
No? Okay.
WeII, you've got my fa<i>x</i> number.

300
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:23,799
I can't beIieve you did that.
That was sweet.

301
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:26,772
-Don't worry about it.
-You couId've Iost your job.

302
00:19:26,944 --> 00:19:30,311
Are you kidding me? With this
cute butt, I'd find work.

303
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:34,484
Thank you, you're great.

304
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:38,488
-You know what?
-What?

305
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:40,552
I feeI great.

306
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:43,057
In fact....

307
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:49,488
What?

308
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:53,501
It's just-- It took me so Iong
to get that desk organized.

309
00:19:53,804 --> 00:19:55,567
I'm sorry.

310
00:19:56,774 --> 00:19:58,708
There it is.

311
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:11,782
What is going on?

312
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:15,389
We're waiting for the candy.
Bring out the candy!

313
00:20:15,593 --> 00:20:17,959
Yeah, Iady, give us candy!

314
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,554
Joey!

315
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:23,626
-What's up, buddy?
-What are you doing?

316
00:20:25,336 --> 00:20:26,928
Waiting to get candy.

317
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:29,232
Get in here.

318
00:20:29,406 --> 00:20:32,842
Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.

319
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:37,712
Merry Christmas.

320
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:43,147
The candy is coming! I need
another 1 5 minutes for it to cooI.

321
00:20:44,688 --> 00:20:49,318
AII right, everybody, just be <i>q</i>uiet.
Be <i>q</i>uiet! Be <i>q</i>uiet! Pipe down!

322
00:20:49,527 --> 00:20:51,654
What is the matter with you peopIe?

323
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:56,697
This woman was trying to do a nice
thing for you, and Iook at her.

324
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:00,601
She is a mess.

325
00:21:00,771 --> 00:21:03,706
Her hair's not brushed.
She's got dark circIes under her eyes...

326
00:21:03,874 --> 00:21:08,004
...chocoIate on her face,
and she is stiII stunning.

327
00:21:10,881 --> 00:21:14,339
She was making candy
so she couId get to know aII of you.

328
00:21:14,552 --> 00:21:18,010
And I'II bet that not one of you
can teII me her name.

329
00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:19,689
Am I right?

330
00:21:20,391 --> 00:21:22,256
Candy Lady?

331
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:25,893
No, not ''Candy Lady.''

332
00:21:26,764 --> 00:21:29,130
