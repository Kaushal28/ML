1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,593
I'm getting my nails done!

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:07,032
You said it was going to be fun.

3
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,739
Which it kind of is.

4
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:14,046
You said there would be guys.
There are no guys.

5
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,144
There's one right over there.

6
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,447
That's a mailman!

7
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,044
That's our mailman!

8
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,847
Hi, how are you....

9
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:31,720
Don't worry. This doesn't
make you any less of a guy.

10
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,725
That does.

11
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,468
What am I sitting on?

12
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:43,269
What was this woman scratching
when this broke off?

13
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:45,610
You know who had nails like that?

14
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:46,834
Oh...

15
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,239
...my...

16
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:49,972
...God!

17
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,980
The One with All the Rugby

18
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,598
Joey, let me ask you a question.

19
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,236
What does this light switch do?

20
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,871
Nothing.

21
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,372
Did it drive you crazy
to not know?

22
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,601
I know what it did.
Nothing.

23
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:57,110
They put it there for something.
How can you not care?

24
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,714
Like this.

25
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,445
Here's another question.

26
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,692
What does the silver
knob on the toilet do?

27
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,188
It flushes it.

28
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:12,524
Since you know, when you come over,
would you use it?

29
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,732
-Hello.
-Hey.

30
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,806
-Oh, my God. Wow.
-Guess who we saw today?

31
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,245
-Janice!
-ls this amazing?

32
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,944
-How have you been?
-Well, I'm divorced.

33
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,448
Oh, wow.

34
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,986
I'm riding the alimony pony.

35
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,921
And there it is.

36
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,891
I just came up to say "hi."

37
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,262
Sweetie, I'll see you later.

38
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,094
I'll see you tonight.

39
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,668
-Bye.
-Bye.

40
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,169
-Bye.
-Bye.

41
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,064
I can't stand the woman!

42
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,941
What?
I thought you were crazy about her!

43
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:03,843
But you know all those annoying
things she did before?

44
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,813
Her voice, her laugh
and her personality?

45
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,212
They're all back!

46
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,585
And she's picked up, like,
nine new ones!

47
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,760
Why'd you bring her here?
There's people here!

48
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,263
Don't worry.
I'm taking care of it.

49
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,492
You are not!
You never break up with her.

50
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,327
I don't have to break up.

51
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,371
We're not involved.
I'll do a preemptive strike.

52
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,509
I'll end it with her
before it starts.

53
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,941
My ass is, like, frozen!

54
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,115
Try sticking it in the freezer
for 20 minutes.

55
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,344
I'm telling you!

56
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,461
I can't believe
you walk alone here at night.

57
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:58,003
-You hear such stories about New York.
-It's not that bad.

58
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:01,139
I mean, l, for one,
feel perfectly safe.

59
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:03,867
Help! Help!

60
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:07,672
No, no, Ross!

61
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,848
These are friends from home.

62
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,540
Liam, Devon, this is Ross.

63
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,586
-Hi, mate.
-How are you, man?

64
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,323
That was a good one, huh?
"Help! Help!"

65
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:20,982
How are you?

66
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,526
I've been meaning to ring you
ever since I arrived...

67
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,460
...but I've been rather busy.

68
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,931
We have not seen each other
since that U2 concert.

69
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,333
Oh, my God. You're right.

70
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,905
Actually, the last time we saw
each other was the next morning.

71
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,236
Oh, Liam!

72
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,104
Oh, Liam.

73
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,080
So were you guys playing soccer?

74
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,413
Or should I call it "football"?

75
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,184
We were playing rugby.

76
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,723
In fact, we're playing tomorrow.
You're welcome to play.

77
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,794
Ross play rugby?
I don't think so.

78
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,966
What's so funny?

79
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:06,361
Well, you're American, to start with.
You don't have rugby here.

80
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:12,571
Well, we didn't have freedom
here until 1776 either, so....

81
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,542
So, good!
We'll see you at the park at two.

82
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,215
Cheers!

83
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,894
Oh, boy! I just love to sing.

84
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,729
Yes, I know you do.

85
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,659
The reason people complained...

86
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:38,233
...was because they paid to hear
the actor sing "Old Man River."

87
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:39,960
Look at us!

88
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:44,735
Who would've thought Cupid had
a station at 14th Street Nails?

89
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,010
Okay, we have to talk.

90
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:53,483
I'm just getting out of
a very serious relationship.

91
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,813
I know. And I'm just
getting out of a marriage.

92
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,753
Talk about "meant to be."

93
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,259
Right. But I think this
is happening too soon.

94
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,090
Oh, too soon, too schmoon!

95
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:11,270
Face it, I'm not letting you
get away this time.

96
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,630
I hear you!

97
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,865
But...

98
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,339
...unfortunately...

99
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,170
...my company...

100
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,713
...is transferring me overseas.

101
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,278
Oh, no!

102
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,544
Where to?

103
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,881
To Paris?

104
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,615
No, not Paris.

105
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,522
To London? Rome? Vienna?

106
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,720
Barcelona?

107
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,660
Could you just stop talking
for a second?

108
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,730
Yemen.

109
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,400
That's right. Yes!
I'm being transferred to Yemen!

110
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:51,901
When?

111
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,737
I don't know exactly.

112
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:59,213
Well, I will just have to
soak up every ounce...

113
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,083
...of Chandler Bing until
that moment comes.

114
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,918
But I do know it's sometime tomorrow.

115
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,090
-Done?
-Yep!

116
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,228
What's up?

117
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,266
This switch is
driving me crazy.

118
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,939
I turned it off
and checked every outlet.

119
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:26,201
Four don't work, which means
one is controlled by the switch.

120
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:30,007
So I plugged things in the outlets
that make noise.

121
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,845
That way, when I turn it on,
I just follow the noise.

122
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,519
Bet I stopped listening first.

123
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:42,123
You know, you also could
have used lamps...

124
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,794
...and followed the light.

125
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,098
Yeah, well, I'm using noise.

126
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,391
So, everybody ready?

127
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,798
Here we go!

128
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,643
Something. I hear something.
Where is it?

129
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,747
It's coming from Joey!

130
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,622
Oh, my God! That's so freaky!
Turn him off!

131
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,799
Could we put on the news?
It might be raining.

132
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:33,443
Hold on. I'm watching
this rugby thing on ESPN.

133
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,513
I'm man enough to play this sport!

134
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:40,946
You're not even man enough to
get the channel that carries the sport.

135
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,583
Hey there, Ross!

136
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,259
Janice.

137
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:54,190
You know, you really didn't
have to help me pack.

138
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,664
When you said all you'd be doing
before you leave is packing...

139
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,339
...you really didn't
leave me much choice.

140
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,101
I thought I did,
but I guess I did not.

141
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,604
What's going on?

142
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:12,347
I'm packing, you know,
because I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.

143
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,878
Thanks for telling me!

144
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,490
I'm going to be pretend-moving
to Yemen. To get rid of her.

145
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:23,784
Good one!

146
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,899
Yemen! That actually sounds
like a real country!

147
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:34,097
I'll show you how to roll your
underwear and stuff it in your shoes.

148
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,569
It's a space-saver.

149
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,639
I do that because
it makes me look taller.

150
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,975
Come on!

151
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,018
-Joey, trade lives with me.
-Nope.

152
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,683
Ross, I can't believe
you said you'd play.

153
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:52,983
This is brutal!

154
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,749
I can handle it.

155
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:59,590
Please, Ross. You got hurt
playing badminton with my dad.

156
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,991
That's because your mom's dog
kept looking at me.

157
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,864
Look! Right here,
it's called a "scrum."

158
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,508
It's like a huddle.

159
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,268
And is a hum like a scruddle?

160
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,082
Ross, they're going kill you!

161
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,880
Why are you doing this, anyway?

162
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,549
You should've seen the guy
she used to date.

163
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,882
He's like "Joe Rugby"!

164
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,357
You're kidding! And he plays rugby?
That's funny!

165
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,525
Oh, I see. You did that.

166
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:40,467
She thought the very idea of me
playing rugby was hilarious.

167
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,197
So I'll show her
how tough I really am.

168
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,044
I'm sorry.
You are a tough guy.

169
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,546
The toughest paleontologist I know.

170
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,716
Ross can take care of himself.
It's not like he's Chandler.

171
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,389
Thanks.

172
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,620
Don't worry about me.

173
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:04,384
I'll just look energetic
and stay away from the ball.

174
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,566
I'll be that guy,
right outside the circle.

175
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,066
Maybe there was a dog
looking at him.

176
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,146
Stay away from that guy
and that guy...

177
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:32,289
...and that one.
Dude, they're all huge!

178
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,451
They're no bigger than me.

179
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:40,688
You're closer to you. So you look
bigger to you from where you are.

180
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,733
I'm going to go say "hello."

181
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,135
I kind of liked it.

182
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,040
I know what to do.

183
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,582
I've got to go Red Ross.

184
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,349
You know, Red Ross?

185
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,851
Totally don't know.

186
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:09,357
That time we were in line
for Dances With Wolves...

187
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:13,258
...and that guy cut in front of us
and I just lost it?

188
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,991
Screamed at him, turned all red!

189
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,096
Red Ross!

190
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,070
You'll see!

191
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,005
Liam, do me a favor.

192
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,408
Go easy on Ross.
It's his first time.

193
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,341
You don't say?

194
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,120
Good luck, babe.

195
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,154
Come on, get in here!

196
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:47,988
Come on!

197
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,477
Come on, get in the bloody scrum!

198
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,110
Ross, get in!

199
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,049
Joey!

200
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,659
You're not going to believe it!
Joshua came in today, and guess what?

201
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,231
He asked you out?

202
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,404
But I showed him some cuff links,
and I felt his pulse.

203
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,873
Saucy!

204
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,871
-What are these?
-Electrical plans for the building.

205
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,882
Okay, should I be scared?

206
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:43,019
I know that switch does something.
I got these from City Hall.

207
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,986
I just paid $25
and waited for three hours.

208
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,591
Wow! If only more people knew!

209
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,633
All right, do you understand any of this?

210
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:00,135
No, I don't understand any
of this electrical stuff.

211
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,207
All right, does this look like a switch?

212
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,865
I don't know.

213
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,636
-ls this wiring?
-I don't know.

214
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,706
That looks like a bunny though.

215
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:24,059
You really didn't have to
take me to the airport.

216
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,322
Oh, please.
Every moment is precious.

217
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,535
Besides, someone had to ride
with your luggage.

218
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:34,001
And your friends don't seem to care
that you're leaving.

219
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,434
We're not that close.

220
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:41,608
Okay. So I guess this is goodbye then.

221
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,246
Oh, no!

222
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:47,510
It's not goodbye. I'm not leaving
till you get on that plane.

223
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,121
Okay. Well, I guess
it's just "wait here" then.

224
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,454
I need a fake ticket to Yemen.

225
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:58,785
One ticket?

226
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,857
I just need a pretend ticket.

227
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,103
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

228
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,239
Okay, what would you give a kid
to play with?

229
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,704
Are you traveling with a child?

230
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,840
No.

231
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,116
She'll think I'm
handing you a credit card.

232
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:22,150
But what I'll really hand you
is a library card.

233
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:28,253
A ticket to Yemen is $2100,
and we don't take library cards.

234
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,328
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

235
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,455
Do you have to stay?

236
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,863
American Express?

237
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,972
I can't believe they're doing that!
I told them to go easy on him!

238
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:55,813
No offense, but sometimes it's hard
to understand you, with the accent.

239
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,853
That's just halftime.
There's more.

240
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:03,650
Did you see me?

241
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,364
I was pretty good.
That is one fun game!

242
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,327
Do me a favor?
Grab me some water?

243
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:11,658
Thanks!

244
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,970
I think I'm dying.
I really do.

245
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,266
Poor baby!

246
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,206
Tell my son that I love him.

247
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,943
Excellent!
Got to have some more fun!

248
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,808
They are killing you.

249
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,577
That's not true.

250
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,650
She's right.
You have to stop!

251
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,915
No! I'm not stopping.
I'm Red Ross!

252
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:37,323
Dude, you go back out there,
you'll be Dead Ross.

253
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,724
I'm not quitting.
I'm going to finish this game.

254
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,935
If you insist on it,
at least let me help you.

255
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:48,105
It's no place for a woman.
Those guys will grab anything!

256
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:53,938
That's not it. I just know a few
things that can help you inflict pain.

257
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,736
I like that.

258
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,475
Listen closely.

259
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,742
Devon has got a weak ankle.

260
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,010
One swift kick and he'll back off.

261
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,915
Bad ankle. Got it!

262
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:08,321
And that big bloke with the beard?
He's got a trick hip.

263
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,821
And David over there,
he doesn't wear a cup.

264
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,423
I could use that.
Trick hip, no cup. Okay!

265
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:20,435
And Liam's got bad knees. Hit him right
and he'll go down like a lamp.

266
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,367
But Liam's on my team.

267
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,610
-I don't care. Just get him!
-Go and get him!

268
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,346
I am going back in!

269
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,977
Red Ross! Yeah!

270
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:44,886
What are these?

271
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:48,395
Just some pictures
I made and hung up.

272
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,863
I thought they'd brighten up the place.
Don't they?

273
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,598
No, don't.

274
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:04,012
There's no hole there.
I just really like that picture.

275
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,017
Oh, my God! Look at this!

276
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,690
But there is a wire there!
It's connected to something!

277
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,759
I don't care! The wires have
come loose in your head!

278
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,259
If I could follow the wire,
I'd find out what it did.

279
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,455
And did you?

280
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:22,691
No.

281
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,862
It disappears behind there.

282
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:29,239
For a minute, I thought
it went downstairs.

283
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,334
Say hello to Mrs. Catrokis.

284
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,948
-Hello, darling.
-Hello, Mrs. Catrokis.

285
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,980
Hey, Mrs. Catrokis, do you know Kenny?

286
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,285
You have got to be kid Wow!

287
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,921
Are you sure you
don't want a doctor?

288
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:54,131
No, that'll just bring me down!

289
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:58,596
This was great! I was great!
This was a great day!

290
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,068
I'm buying everyone coffee.

291
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,967
Just grab my wallet.
It's in my pocket.

292
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,642
No, not you.

293
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,642
Your eye's still popping out.
I'll go get some ice.

294
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,477
Ice, yeah!
I'm so in the mood for ice.

295
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,580
You were amazing out there.

296
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,647
I kind of was, wasn't l?

297
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:20,881
Oh, my God!

298
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:24,790
I made a man twice my size cry!

299
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,165
I haven't done that since I was four and
I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.

300
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,171
You really enjoyed yourself,
didn't you?

301
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,897
Are you kidding?
I hurt three huge men.

302
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,009
I gave a guy a bloody nose!

303
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,337
I'm not proud of it...

304
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:43,813
...but I really am!

305
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,251
And it's all because of you.

306
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:52,148
-Wonderful, amazing you.
-I think you've got a concussion.

307
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,949
No, I'm serious.
Thank you.

308
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,163
You're welcome.

309
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,197
I'm sorry.
Did that hurt you?

310
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:03,492
It's worth the pain.

311
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,435
You know what? It's not.

312
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:16,804
This is the final boarding call
for flight 664 to Yemen.

313
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,213
Well, I guess I gotta go.

314
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,349
My Bing-a-ling.

315
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,190
I'll wait for you.

316
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,486
How long will you be gone?

317
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:36,231
Well, just until we find
an energy source to replace fuel.

318
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,036
I'll write you every day.

319
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,467
15 Yemen Road, Yemen.

320
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,169
Okay. Goodbye.

321
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:10,168
Janice! There you are!
I had to have one last kiss.

322
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,827
And also, you said you'd leave
after I got on the plane!

323
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,269
No. I want to see you take off.

324
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,445
Well, then I guess
I'm going to Yemen.

325
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,182
I'm going to Yemen!

326
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,951
When we get to Yemen,
can I stay with you?

327
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:39,527
All right. The super couldn't
figure out what it did.

328
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:43,132
The $200-an-hour electrician
couldn't figure out what it did.

329
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,395
I've had seven
pretty serious shocks.

330
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,829
I give up.

331
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,975
Thank God.

332
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,071
I guess Joey was right.

333
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,775
It does nothing.

334
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,185
See?

335
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,589
I'm doing it!
I am totally doing it!

336
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,200
I lost it.
