1
00:00:02,114 --> 00:00:06,073
So your first sexual experience
was with a woman?

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:09,581
l was 1 5.
lt was my best friend, Ruth.

3
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:12,188
And we got drunk
on that hard cider.

4
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:15,188
And then suddenly,
we were making out.

5
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:17,250
Tell it again.

6
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:21,821
Seriously.

7
00:00:24,903 --> 00:00:28,634
ls that woman capable of talking
about anything else but sex?

8
00:00:28,974 --> 00:00:33,274
Yeah, sure. Earlier she was
talking about geography.

9
00:00:33,712 --> 00:00:38,115
She was listing the countries
she's done it in.

10
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:41,052
l think we all
learned something.

11
00:00:42,654 --> 00:00:44,918
Hey, you guys. Look what l found!
Look at this.

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,354
That's my mom's writing.
Look.

13
00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:51,292
''Me and Frank and Phoebe,
graduation, 1 965.''

14
00:00:51,463 --> 00:00:55,263
-Do you know what that means?
-That you're actually 50?

15
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:58,434
That's not me, Phoebe.
That's her pal Phoebe.

16
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:01,004
According to her high-school
yearbook, they were BFF.

17
00:01:02,808 --> 00:01:06,005
-Best Friends Forever.
-That's great!

18
00:01:06,178 --> 00:01:10,410
l know! She probably has all kinds
of stories about my parents.

19
00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:12,379
And she might even know
where my dad is.

20
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:14,519
l looked her up.
She lives by the beach.

21
00:01:14,686 --> 00:01:16,586
Maybe this weekend
we can go to the beach.

22
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:18,120
Yeah, we can!

23
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,418
-Shoot, l can't go. l have to work.
-That's too bad.

24
00:01:22,094 --> 00:01:23,755
Big fat bummer.

25
00:01:25,297 --> 00:01:27,765
So, great! Tomorrow we're
gonna drive out to Montauk.

26
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:30,333
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!

27
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:34,631
The One At the Beach

28
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:22,813
Joey will be right down.
He's looking for his mask.

29
00:02:22,988 --> 00:02:24,979
-A swim mask?
-No, his gorilla mask.

30
00:02:26,558 --> 00:02:29,425
He wears it in the ocean
to scare off the fish.

31
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:33,788
Would you look at them?

32
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,090
l'm never gonna find
a boyfriend again.

33
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:39,635
l'm gonna die an old maid.

34
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:42,103
You're not gonna die an old maid.

35
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:44,868
Maybe an old spinster cook.

36
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:50,648
-Thanks.
-Besides, worse comes to worse...

37
00:02:50,816 --> 00:02:53,011
...l'll be your boyfriend.

38
00:02:56,054 --> 00:02:57,078
Yeah, right.

39
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:02,259
Why is that so funny?

40
00:03:02,427 --> 00:03:04,554
You made a joke, right?

41
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,164
So l laughed.

42
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:10,998
A little too hard.

43
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,663
What am l,
not boyfriend material?

44
00:03:14,372 --> 00:03:16,431
No. You're Chandler.

45
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:20,876
You know. Chandler!

46
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:24,580
Okay, so we've established
my name and hit me.

47
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:28,209
But theoretically, say we weren't
friends. Say it's a blind date.

48
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:33,016
l show up at your door, and l'm,
like, ''Hey, nice to meet you.''

49
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:38,489
l'd probably be scared of a guy
using a fake voice.

50
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:41,426
Hey. Good!
You bought food.

51
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,091
No, just my luggage.

52
00:03:51,176 --> 00:03:53,406
l am having the best karma this week.

53
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:55,705
First, l find this woman
who knew my parents...

54
00:03:55,881 --> 00:03:58,873
...then my client with the fuzzy back
gives me his beach house.

55
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,883
What about that bike
messenger you hit?

56
00:04:02,053 --> 00:04:04,419
l wasn't talking about his karma.

57
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,816
Hey, check out the hat!

58
00:04:11,696 --> 00:04:13,994
Wait a minute, l know that hat.

59
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,158
l was taken aboard that hat.

60
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:21,130
They did experiments on me.
l can't have children!

61
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,738
Seriously, where did you get the hat?

62
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,377
Ross gave it to me.

63
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:29,309
-l think she looks good.
-Thank you.

64
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:31,745
Did he buy it for you...

65
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:33,111
...or win it for you?

66
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:37,153
Excuse me,
my fashion-impaired friends...

67
00:04:37,322 --> 00:04:39,347
...l'm here to tell you
that hats are back.

68
00:04:39,524 --> 00:04:43,255
And this time, they've ganged up
and formed one giant superhat.

69
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:50,459
Go, go, go!

70
00:04:50,635 --> 00:04:52,899
Now everybody wants to be
under the hat!

71
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:02,376
What's with all this sand?

72
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:05,107
Bob said there might be flood damage.

73
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:07,513
Either that, or he has
a really big cat.

74
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:11,314
You know what this reminds me of?

75
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:14,089
Why couldn't l be your boyfriend?

76
00:05:15,493 --> 00:05:17,620
Are you still on that?

77
00:05:17,796 --> 00:05:20,321
-Would you let it go already?
-Thank you, Joey.

78
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:22,659
But you'd go out with me, right?

79
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:26,565
No. lt's the same as with Chandler.
We're friends.

80
00:05:26,738 --> 00:05:29,673
Let's say that we were
the last two guys on the planet...

81
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:32,901
...and you had a gun to your head.
Which one would you pick?

82
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:35,808
Which one of you
has the gun to my head?

83
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:41,684
Well, yes.
lt's kind of an unusual house.

84
00:05:41,853 --> 00:05:45,721
lt has three beautiful bedrooms
and no baths.

85
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:49,017
But, you know,
the ocean is right there.

86
00:05:49,828 --> 00:05:50,886
Knock, knock, knock.

87
00:05:51,062 --> 00:05:53,394
Hang on a second.
Come in, come in.

88
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:55,590
So think about it and call me back.

89
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:59,667
-Are you Phoebe Abbott?
-Yes.

90
00:05:59,838 --> 00:06:03,171
Surprise, Phoebe Abbott!
l'm your best friend's daughter!

91
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:06,942
You're lrwin's daughter?

92
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:09,443
No. l mean your old best friend.

93
00:06:09,614 --> 00:06:10,603
Here.

94
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:14,309
-Lily? From high school? Remember?
-Oh, God, Lily.

95
00:06:14,486 --> 00:06:17,182
Yes. Of course l remember Lily.

96
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:21,382
-Then you must be--
-Phoebe, Phoebe.

97
00:06:23,161 --> 00:06:25,459
She named me after you, l guess.

98
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,526
Wow. Well.
Look, there's Frank!

99
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,830
Yeah! Yes! Yes, yes!
That's my dad. That's Frank!

100
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:35,939
l'm sorry l'm getting all flingy.

101
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:38,632
Take it easy.
lf you want, there's cookies.

102
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,643
-Or sangria! l could make sangria!
-No, no!

103
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,440
Sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.

104
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:50,314
Anyway, l've been
looking for my father.

105
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:54,953
-Have you heard from him or seen him?
-No, l'm sorry.

106
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:59,085
l guess l lost track of everybody
after high school.

107
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:04,968
Well, so tell me everything
about my parents. Everything.

108
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:08,367
Well, you know,
we were always together.

109
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,067
-The other kids had a nickname for us.
-What was it?

110
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:13,733
The Three Losers.

111
00:07:14,546 --> 00:07:16,639
Poor Lily.

112
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:22,317
l heard about what happened. That
must have been just terrible for you...

113
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:25,012
...losing your mother that way.

114
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:27,957
Yeah, no, it was great.

115
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,931
You know what a really good
rainy-day game is?

116
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:43,973
-What?
-l mean, naked game.

117
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:47,204
-We should totally play strip poker.
-No!

118
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,744
Are you crazy?

119
00:07:48,913 --> 00:07:52,474
Come on. When you go away,
you have to play. lt's, like, a law.

120
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:54,450
Well, it's not a law.

121
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:58,214
As long as it stays attached to that
tax reform bill, it never will be!

122
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:01,286
-All done.
-Thank you.

123
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:03,984
Okay. Who's next?

124
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:06,452
No!

125
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:09,297
No way!

126
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:13,665
Come on, please. l'm bored.
You let me do it once before.

127
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:21,275
Well, if that's the rule
this weekend....

128
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:26,208
-Get away.
-Take it like a man. Come on!

129
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:29,143
Big bullies!

130
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:46,328
-How are we doing?
-Bored and bored.

131
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:50,340
You know what naked card game's
never boring?

132
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:51,497
No!

133
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:55,074
So, what's Phoebe like?

134
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,046
l'm kind, caring and sweet.
What's Monica like?

135
00:09:00,118 --> 00:09:02,678
No, the other Phoebe.
The one you went to see?

136
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:05,515
l think she knows where my dad is!

137
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,749
-Cool!
-Well, where is he?

138
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:10,861
She was pretending she hasn't
heard from him in years...

139
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:12,997
...but l found this picture
on her fridge.

140
00:09:13,164 --> 00:09:15,894
lsn't this what he would
look like now?

141
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:20,662
-Totally familiar.
-Oh, yeah!

142
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:22,468
Why would she lie to you?

143
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,041
We're having dinner tomorrow night,
so l figured she'll tell me then.

144
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:28,475
Maybe she just wanted
to give him time...

145
00:09:28,646 --> 00:09:30,944
...to buy me presents.
l don't know.

146
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,643
-So you're all bored?
-Yes.

147
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:38,220
l'll close my eyes
and point to someone.

148
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:42,018
Whoever l point to has to come up with
something fun, and we have to do it.

149
00:09:42,193 --> 00:09:44,525
Okay! Fan out! Fan out!

150
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:49,992
You know, we could just do this!

151
00:09:54,472 --> 00:09:57,703
We all have to play strip poker?

152
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:02,042
Why, all of a sudden,
do you wanna play strip poker?

153
00:10:02,213 --> 00:10:05,910
l think because of margaritas
three, four and nine.

154
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:10,816
Strip Happy Days Game?

155
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:16,291
l couldn't find cards, so it was this
or Strip Bag-of-old-knitting-stuff.

156
00:10:16,995 --> 00:10:18,553
Done.

157
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:25,297
''Fonzie gives you two thumbs up.
Collect two cool points.''

158
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:30,034
lf you get five points, you get to make
someone take off one item of clothing.

159
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,802
lt hasn't happened yet,
but we're all very excited.

160
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:35,206
Okay, come on.

161
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,240
Daddy needs a new pair
of electromagnetic microscopes...

162
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,613
...for the Prehistoric Forensics
department.

163
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:50,651
Okay. ''Take Pinky Tuscadero
up to lnspiration Point.

164
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:53,126
Collect three cool points.''
Yeah!

165
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:55,129
Which gives me five.

166
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,394
And let's see, who is gonna
lose their clothes?

167
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,563
l think l pick our strip poker
sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.

168
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:08,542
All right, relax. lt's just a shoe.

169
00:11:11,282 --> 00:11:15,651
''Your band is playing at Arnold's.
Collect three cool points.''

170
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,258
Which means l have five,
and that means l get Joey's boxers.

171
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:28,760
Fine. Gang up on me.

172
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:31,868
l got you all
right where l want you.

173
00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:34,034
Come on! Take them off!

174
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:35,866
Actually, it's kind of cold.

175
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,498
How about l keep my boxers on
and give you a peek at the good stuff?

176
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:42,141
All right,
l'm gonna make more margaritas.

177
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:45,305
What are you doing?
Trying to get me drunk?

178
00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:48,077
l'm just making margaritas.

179
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,247
Think l'll help her out.

180
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:57,052
-What is going on here?
-What?

181
00:11:57,228 --> 00:11:59,753
-You're painting his toenails.
-Come on!

182
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:01,796
-Chasing him around the room.
-Please!

183
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:04,332
He's totally flirting with you too.

184
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,329
He is, isn't he?

185
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:11,968
l don't know. Maybe it's just
being here at the beach together...

186
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:14,236
...l don't know,
but it's like something--

187
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:21,710
-Hi, Bonnie.
-Hi.

188
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:24,787
My boss let me off early,
so l took the train.

189
00:12:24,956 --> 00:12:26,355
What are you guys doing?

190
00:12:26,524 --> 00:12:29,084
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game.

191
00:12:30,094 --> 00:12:32,119
Cool! l'll catch up!

192
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:41,803
So you still don't think...

193
00:12:41,973 --> 00:12:44,407
...l'm boyfriend material?

194
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,209
l saw you checking me out
during the game last night.

195
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,243
You didn't even
take off your pants.

196
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,782
Well, lucky for you.

197
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,180
-What?
-l don't know.

198
00:12:57,822 --> 00:13:02,088
Well, is everybody else having
just the best time?

199
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:04,523
Joey's asleep.

200
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:17,704
After he passed out, we put the
sand around him to keep him warm.

201
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:24,375
Well, l assume the happy couple
isn't up yet?

202
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:26,813
Did you guys hear them last night?

203
00:13:26,984 --> 00:13:28,849
l don't know what
they were doing, but...

204
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,386
...sea turtles actually
came up to the house.

205
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:35,792
Good morning.

206
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,587
-How'd everybody sleep?
-Great.

207
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:39,855
-Like a log.
-Us too.

208
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,155
l'm going for a walk.

209
00:13:48,806 --> 00:13:51,741
Good morning.
Nice breasts by the way.

210
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:04,216
Hey, what happened to you?

211
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:07,847
Nothing. l just felt like
hanging out and reading.

212
00:14:08,493 --> 00:14:12,691
The water was so great. We jumped
off this pier and my suit came off.

213
00:14:14,265 --> 00:14:15,698
Sorry l missed that.

214
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:18,068
Joey and Chandler sure are funny.

215
00:14:20,371 --> 00:14:22,896
l brought back half the beach
in my hair.

216
00:14:23,074 --> 00:14:25,099
lt was so much easier
when l shaved my head.

217
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:32,312
You know, l gotta tell you...

218
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:35,316
...l just loved your look
when you were bald.

219
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:37,884
Really?

220
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:40,751
l think about shaving it
all off again sometimes.

221
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:42,920
-Really?
-Yeah.

222
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:45,258
You definitely should do that.

223
00:14:46,364 --> 00:14:48,559
-You know what? l should do it!
-Yeah!

224
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:51,566
You know what? Thank you.
You are so cool.

225
00:14:51,736 --> 00:14:53,863
Stop. Go on.

226
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:56,768
-Now go shave that head.
-All right.

227
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:07,677
-l know l've asked you this before.
-A hundred times before!

228
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:13,490
-How am l not right for you?
-l don't know.

229
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:15,626
l like guys like Richard.

230
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:18,591
Or Pete,
before he went insane.

231
00:15:18,763 --> 00:15:21,823
l don't know.
Just somebody more mature.

232
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:24,559
So l'm not mature enough for you?

233
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:26,862
Monica needs somebody more mature.

234
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:35,779
What's the matter?

235
00:15:35,947 --> 00:15:38,848
She canceled.
My namesake canceled on me.

236
00:15:39,016 --> 00:15:42,474
She claims she had to go out of town
suddenly. She's avoiding me.

237
00:15:42,653 --> 00:15:46,214
She doesn't want to tell me where my
father is. She knows but won't tell me!

238
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,585
Pheebs, that sucks.

239
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:52,595
Well, don't
''Pheebs, that sucks'' me yet.

240
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:56,225
-Where are you going?
-She's out of town.

241
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,029
There's gotta be something in her
house that tells me where my father is.

242
00:16:00,204 --> 00:16:02,638
Some people call that
''breaking and entering.''

243
00:16:03,074 --> 00:16:05,941
-Well, are any of those people here?
-No.

244
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,342
Okay. Look,
l'll do something nice, okay?

245
00:16:10,515 --> 00:16:12,676
l'll fill her ice trays. Good?

246
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:16,650
Hey, everybody!

247
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:22,692
Look what you did!

248
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:28,022
-You wanna touch it?
-No, but it's great.

249
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:29,791
Come on, touch it.

250
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:37,538
You can feel all the bones
in your skull.

251
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,580
l was having a little chat
with Bonnie, and guess what?

252
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:57,285
She happened to bring up who was
behind the whole head-shaving idea.

253
00:16:57,461 --> 00:17:00,294
And now, who was it?
That's right. lt was you!

254
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:04,432
That was her idea.

255
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:07,127
l just gave her a nudge.

256
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:09,865
She said you gave her the razor.

257
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:15,106
So anyone up for a midnight dip
in the ocean?

258
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,906
-No, l'm good.
-No, thanks.

259
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:19,641
-Okay, l'll see you in a bit.
-Okay, have fun.

260
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,216
Come on, see?
She doesn't look that bad.

261
00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:28,688
You can see the moonlight
bouncing off her head!

262
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:32,755
-What the hell were you thinking?
-l don't know.

263
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,023
You don't know?
You balded my girlfriend!

264
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:36,325
All right.

265
00:17:38,235 --> 00:17:41,693
Do you think it's easy for me
to see you with somebody else?

266
00:17:41,872 --> 00:17:43,931
You're the one who ended it!
Remember?

267
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:48,135
Because l was mad at you!
Not because l stopped loving you!

268
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,142
-You still love me?
-No.

269
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:55,109
You still love me.

270
00:17:56,153 --> 00:17:58,587
Yeah, so?
You love me.

271
00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:05,419
What does this mean?

272
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:08,326
l mean, do you want
to get back together?

273
00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:11,024
No! Maybe!

274
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:12,793
l don't know.

275
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:22,342
l still can't forgive you
for what you did.

276
00:18:22,513 --> 00:18:25,482
l can't. But sometimes when
l'm with you, l just feel so....

277
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,008
What?

278
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:30,385
l just feel....

279
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:33,888
-l just--
-What?

280
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:35,314
l feel--

281
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,597
No! l don't care!

282
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:50,104
l'm not playing one-on-one strip poker
with you for practice!

283
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:52,435
But l made cards!

284
00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:56,971
Good night.

285
00:18:57,481 --> 00:18:59,415
l'm going upstairs.

286
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,380
-Good night.
-Good night.

287
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:10,056
Wanna play strip poker
for practice?

288
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:29,812
My ass!

289
00:20:08,385 --> 00:20:10,353
No! lt's me! lt's me!

290
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:13,547
-l didn't wanna make any noise!
-Then don't break in!

291
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:17,919
-l'm sorry!
-What are you doing here?

292
00:20:18,462 --> 00:20:22,125
l came to fill your ice-cube tray.

293
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:24,391
What?

294
00:20:27,738 --> 00:20:30,002
Okay, look.

295
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:34,938
l took this picture from your fridge.
l know that this is my father.

296
00:20:35,112 --> 00:20:38,479
This is Frank Buffay, and you were
standing next to him!

297
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:41,474
Now, look, l deserve
to know where l came from.

298
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:44,917
All right? So if you can help me
find my father, then you should.

299
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:47,284
Otherwise, you're just mean.

300
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,890
So just tell me the truth.

301
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:53,824
All right.

302
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:58,329
The man in that picture
is Chuck Mangione.

303
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:02,669
My father is Chuck Mangione?

304
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,274
No, no!
That's just Chuck Mangione.

305
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:07,842
l sold him a house last year.

306
00:21:08,012 --> 00:21:12,108
And l'm very sorry, but l really
don't know where your father is.

307
00:21:12,283 --> 00:21:14,114
And that's the truth.

308
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,654
But you're right.

309
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:22,217
l think that a person should know
where they come from.

310
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:25,452
Which is why l....

311
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:36,137
l'm your mother.

312
00:21:40,744 --> 00:21:44,077
l wanted to tell you
yesterday, but l just...

313
00:21:44,248 --> 00:21:45,909
...felt all floopy, and....

314
00:21:49,086 --> 00:21:51,316
You guys are totally
getting back together.

315
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,956
That's not true. She doesn't
even know what she wants.

316
00:21:54,124 --> 00:21:56,092
Rachel's still mad
about the whole thing.

317
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,559
Then you gotta back away.
You don't need that kind of hurt.

318
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,664
Take it from a guy who's...

319
00:22:01,832 --> 00:22:05,165
...never had a long-term relationship.

320
00:22:05,936 --> 00:22:10,464
l know, but l really want to go
up there and finish that kiss.

321
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,244
The water is great.
You should go in.

322
00:22:15,412 --> 00:22:17,710
No, thanks. l just had an M&M.

323
00:22:17,882 --> 00:22:20,146
Okay.
Well, good night.

324
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:21,784
Good night.

325
00:22:22,686 --> 00:22:25,780
-Don't be too long.
-Okey-dokey.

326
00:22:26,924 --> 00:22:29,392
There is not one hair
on that head.

327
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,190
lt'll grow back, right?
And she's really fun, and she's cool.

328
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:36,299
And l'm finally moving on.

329
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:39,129
Getting over Rachel was so....

330
00:22:40,304 --> 00:22:43,273
l'm finally feeling sane.
And if l go up there...

331
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,431
...and l kiss her....

332
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:48,203
God, l want to kiss her!

333
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:52,247
And it doesn't work out, do l wanna
put myself through that again?

334
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,815
Let me get this straight.

335
00:22:53,984 --> 00:22:58,978
lf you go with Bonnie, you're doing the
smart, healthy thing and moving on.

336
00:22:59,156 --> 00:23:02,592
Right? And if you go with Rachel,
Bonnie's free tonight?

337
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:27,406
Hi there.

338
00:23:29,286 --> 00:23:31,618
That's that weird voice again.

339
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:33,120
Okay.
Let me try it again.

340
