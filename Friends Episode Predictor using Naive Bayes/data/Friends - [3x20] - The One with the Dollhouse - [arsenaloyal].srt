1
00:00:02,381 --> 00:00:04,611
You're telling me
this actress person...

2
00:00:04,783 --> 00:00:08,981
...is the only woman you ever wanted
who didn't want you back?

3
00:00:09,655 --> 00:00:11,418
Oh, my God.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,388
ls this what it's like to be you?

5
00:00:15,193 --> 00:00:18,219
-You're crazy about her, huh?
-You have no idea.

6
00:00:18,397 --> 00:00:22,333
When we're on-stage,
l get to kiss her and touch her.

7
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:24,262
She goes home with the director...

8
00:00:24,436 --> 00:00:27,030
...and it's like somebody's
ripping out my heart.

9
00:00:27,205 --> 00:00:30,800
lt's so great to see you
feeling like this.

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,971
Dad called this morning.

11
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:40,841
Aunt Sylvia passed away.

12
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:44,354
Yes! Yes!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

13
00:00:47,025 --> 00:00:49,892
We were all
pretty shaken up about it.

14
00:00:50,062 --> 00:00:51,427
Am l missing something?

15
00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:54,430
l always thought death was
supposed to be sad, in a way.

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,530
Well, Aunt Sylvia was...

17
00:00:57,736 --> 00:00:59,397
...not a nice person.

18
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:03,905
She was a cruel, cranky old bitch.

19
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:08,441
And l'm sorry she died.
Did Dad say l get the dollhouse?

20
00:01:08,747 --> 00:01:11,875
-You get the dollhouse.
-l get the dollhouse!

21
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:17,380
A house for dolls!
That is so cool.

22
00:01:17,756 --> 00:01:20,247
When l was a kid, l had a barrel.

23
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,020
You had a barrel for a dollhouse?

24
00:01:24,196 --> 00:01:26,664
No, just a barrel.

25
00:01:27,232 --> 00:01:29,325
You know what? You can play
with my dollhouse.

26
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:32,001
-Really?
-Any time you want.

27
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,264
When l was younger, all l wanted
was to play with this dollhouse.

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,603
But no! lt was to be looked at,
never played with.

29
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:42,372
My grandmother used to say
that exact same thing to me.

30
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,484
More of a bathtub-type situation.

31
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:49,314
She did give you one chance.

32
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:53,049
She told Monica she could play with
the dollhouse if she lost 20 pounds.

33
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:57,624
Yeah, well, look who's
losing weight now, Aunt Sylvia.

34
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:01,191
The One With the Doll House

35
00:02:49,214 --> 00:02:52,513
Thanks for lunch.
You didn't have to walk me here.

36
00:02:52,684 --> 00:02:55,050
That's okay. No problem.

37
00:02:57,923 --> 00:03:02,587
You do realize we don't keep the
women's lingerie here in the office.

38
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:05,956
Yes, l realize that.

39
00:03:06,531 --> 00:03:09,432
-Summer catalog.
-That's the stuff.

40
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:13,037
Rachel, l need the Versace invoice.

41
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:15,705
You don't work for me.

42
00:03:15,874 --> 00:03:18,900
Joanna, this is my friend
Chandler Bing. Joanna.

43
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:20,772
Bing? That's a great name.

44
00:03:21,146 --> 00:03:25,014
Thanks. lt's Gaelic for,
''Thy turkey's done.''

45
00:03:26,985 --> 00:03:30,978
-l'm gonna go. Nice meeting you.
-You too.

46
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,821
So, what's wrong with him?

47
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:40,158
Nothing. He's just goofy like that.
l actually hardly notice it anymore.

48
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:45,736
No, no. l mean, is he married
or involved with anyone?

49
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:50,034
He's not married
or involved with anyone.

50
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:53,072
Well, Rachel....

51
00:03:53,245 --> 00:03:55,179
Actually, you know what?
Forget it.

52
00:03:55,847 --> 00:03:58,816
-l'll ask him for you, if you want.
-Would you?

53
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:02,852
Or is it too sad and desperate,
something that Sophie would do?

54
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:06,149
-l am here.
-l know that.

55
00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:10,218
Look at it!

56
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,964
Wallpaper's a little faded.
That's okay.

57
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:15,599
Carpet's a little loose.

58
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:17,257
Hardwood floors?!

59
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:27,144
-lt's so beautiful!
-l know!

60
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,808
So l'm here, ready to play!

61
00:04:30,982 --> 00:04:35,180
l brought a bunch of stuff
for the house, so check it out.

62
00:04:39,057 --> 00:04:40,183
What's this?

63
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:42,826
That's a dog.
Every house should have a dog.

64
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:46,355
Not one that can pee on the roof.

65
00:04:47,632 --> 00:04:53,036
Maybe it's so big because the house
was built on radioactive waste.

66
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:58,509
And is this in case
the house sneezes?

67
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:03,373
No, that's the ghost for the attic.

68
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:08,649
-l don't want a ghost.
-Well, nobody wants a ghost.

69
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:10,987
But you've got one...

70
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:16,025
...because the house is sitting on
an ancient lndian burial ground.

71
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:20,527
Wait a minute. The house
was built on radioactive waste...

72
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,930
...and an ancient
lndian burial ground?

73
00:05:24,102 --> 00:05:26,866
That would never happen.

74
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:31,074
Obviously you don't know much
about the U.S. government.

75
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:37,839
-l need to talk to you.
-Sure. What's up?

76
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:40,477
Oh, sorry. l meant Chandler.

77
00:05:41,786 --> 00:05:43,447
l know.

78
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:48,183
Well, if something comes up....

79
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:55,357
l'm glad you guys are past
that little awkward phase.

80
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:59,534
My boss. Joanna. When you left...

81
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:02,264
...she started asking questions
about you....

82
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,271
Liked what she saw?

83
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:08,542
Dug my action, did she?

84
00:06:08,713 --> 00:06:11,944
Checking out the Chan Chan Man!

85
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:17,145
That was...

86
00:06:17,322 --> 00:06:19,187
...surreal.

87
00:06:19,357 --> 00:06:21,689
What do you think?
Are you interested at all?

88
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,329
Yeah. She seemed cool.
Attractive. l'll do it.

89
00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:30,093
Thank you. This is so great.
She's gonna love me.

90
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:34,230
Dinosaur attack!
Quick, everybody into the house!

91
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:39,402
All right, Phoebe, you know what?
That's it. That's it. All right?

92
00:06:39,577 --> 00:06:42,944
No dinosaurs, no ghosts,
no giant dogs, okay?

93
00:06:43,114 --> 00:06:47,016
They're not the right size, they're
not Victorian and they don't go.

94
00:06:49,688 --> 00:06:51,121
Fine.

95
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,356
Come, dinosaur. We're not welcome
in the house of no imagination.

96
00:06:56,528 --> 00:07:01,090
While we're hovering around the subject,
l just have to say that dinosaurs...

97
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:04,326
...they don't go, ''ruff!''

98
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,298
The little ones do.

99
00:07:15,513 --> 00:07:17,674
-Hey, Kate.
-Morning.

100
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:20,317
l went to that restaurant
you were talking about--

101
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:21,679
Hey, lovely.

102
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:24,253
Come, talk to me for a minute.

103
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:28,986
And l ate the food. lt was good.
l had the fish. Yeah, really good.

104
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:33,762
l'm Lauren. Kate's understudy.

105
00:07:33,932 --> 00:07:36,366
-Joey Tribbiani.
-l know.

106
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:38,399
l'm a big fan of yours.

107
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,435
What?

108
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,173
l used to schedule my classes
so l could watch Dr. Drake Ramoray...

109
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:47,004
...on Days of our Lives.

110
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:50,011
-Get out of here. Really?
-Absolutely.

111
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:53,383
But then they went and dropped you
down that elevator shaft.

112
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:56,850
They gave me the shaft, all right.

113
00:07:57,022 --> 00:07:59,183
You're so funny.

114
00:07:59,357 --> 00:08:01,723
What are you doing after rehearsal?

115
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:05,693
-Want to get a drink or something?
-Well....

116
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:12,132
Yeah. Sure.
A drink sounds great.

117
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:15,830
-Cool. l'll see you then.
-All right.

118
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,313
All right. lt's time to act,
my talking props.

119
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,050
lf you wanna make the
boys' bathroom realistic...

120
00:08:31,222 --> 00:08:34,953
...you're gonna have to put some teeny,
tiny porno magazines behind the toilet.

121
00:08:38,763 --> 00:08:41,027
Look everybody!
Look at my new dollhouse!

122
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:48,597
Look, look!

123
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:53,040
Hey, what's this?

124
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:56,271
lt's a slide instead of stairs.
Look.

125
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,245
Very interesting, Phoebe.

126
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,109
What's this?

127
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:06,815
The licorice room.
You can eat all the furniture.

128
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:12,795
When guests come over, they can
stay on the Tootsie Roll-away bed.

129
00:09:13,832 --> 00:09:16,266
This is the coolest house ever!

130
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:20,393
Does anyone want to join me
in the Aroma Room?

131
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:22,631
-All right.
-l would.

132
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:24,533
Hey, guys? Guys!

133
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:27,109
Did you see my new china cabinet?

134
00:09:30,548 --> 00:09:32,379
Watch. Watch.

135
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:35,211
And. And.

136
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:42,022
Hey, my father's house does that.

137
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:46,189
Okay. How did it go?
Tell me everything!

138
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:47,729
The movie was great...

139
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:52,461
...dinner was great, and there's nothing
like a cool, crisp New York evening.

140
00:09:52,637 --> 00:09:58,132
Of course, l didn't enjoy any of that
because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!

141
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,876
Chandler is fantastic!

142
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:04,070
-What?
-We click! You know how people click?

143
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:08,447
He came by to pick me up, l opened
the door and it was just like, ''click!''

144
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:10,210
Did he tell you?

145
00:10:10,388 --> 00:10:13,152
He's got such a good heart.
Doesn't he have a good heart?

146
00:10:13,324 --> 00:10:17,226
And he's so sweet. He said he'd
call, so put him straight through.

147
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:20,694
-lsn't this great?
-Don't spoil it.

148
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:26,599
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?
What do you say?

149
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:33,177
lt's you.
Just one sec.

150
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:36,746
l'm going to take this call.

151
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:40,351
When l continue, l hope
that there will appear on-stage...

152
00:10:40,518 --> 00:10:44,978
...this magical thing
that in the theater we call...

153
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:48,182
...committing to the moment!

154
00:10:52,363 --> 00:10:54,957
The guy's like a cartoon.

155
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:58,765
-What do you see in him, anyway?
-He happens to be brilliant.

156
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,603
Which is more than l can say
for that sweater you're dating.

157
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:06,409
l'm not interested in her sweater.

158
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:10,207
lt's what's underneath her sweater
that counts.

159
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:15,975
And besides, since when do you care
who l'm going out with?

160
00:11:16,154 --> 00:11:19,123
l don't care.
Why, do you want me to care?

161
00:11:19,691 --> 00:11:22,819
Do you want me
to want you to care?

162
00:11:22,994 --> 00:11:24,757
Do you?

163
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:26,123
What?

164
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:31,325
Okay. l'm afraid to say this,
but let's pick it up where we left off.

165
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:42,173
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?
What do you say?

166
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:44,975
l've got no reason to stay.

167
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:52,148
Stop! Stop it!
You must stop!

168
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:57,061
You are bad actors!

169
00:11:57,228 --> 00:11:59,719
This is a terrible play!

170
00:11:59,897 --> 00:12:02,263
l'll see you in the morning.

171
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:08,102
l can't believe we go on
in a week.

172
00:12:08,273 --> 00:12:10,673
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

173
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:15,945
So since we're getting off early,
do you want to go and paint mugs?

174
00:12:17,448 --> 00:12:19,040
What?

175
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:22,812
At the place l told you about
last night?

176
00:12:23,221 --> 00:12:26,088
Yeah, with the mug-painting.

177
00:12:26,257 --> 00:12:28,817
l was so listening to that.

178
00:12:29,594 --> 00:12:33,462
But you know what?
l need to work on my stuff tonight.

179
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:36,327
Okay.
l'll see you tomorrow.

180
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:43,131
Good night.

181
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:51,809
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, l guess.

182
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:56,185
What are we gonna do
about the scene?

183
00:12:56,354 --> 00:12:57,753
l don't know.

184
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:04,660
Maybe if it had more heat.

185
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:06,558
Well, how do you mean?

186
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:10,963
Adrianne's looking
for a reason to stay, right?

187
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:13,933
Victor can't just kiss her.
He's gotta....

188
00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:16,471
He's gotta really give her a reason.

189
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:19,469
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.

190
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:27,078
Or maybe....

191
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:31,278
Maybe he could grab her,
and lift her up.

192
00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:35,517
Then Adrianne could wrap her legs
around his waist.

193
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:38,592
She could do that.

194
00:13:38,763 --> 00:13:41,493
And claw at his back.

195
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:46,763
Right. Then she could rip off his shirt
and kiss his chest and his stomach.

196
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:50,965
Then he could use his teeth
to undo her dress...

197
00:13:51,142 --> 00:13:52,871
...and bite her!

198
00:13:53,044 --> 00:13:54,978
And then right when the scene ends...

199
00:13:55,146 --> 00:14:00,083
...he could take her
with this raw, animal....

200
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:06,380
Something like that?

201
00:14:06,557 --> 00:14:09,890
Yeah. That's pretty much
what l had in mind.

202
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:33,475
lt's a little early to be drinking.

203
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:38,378
Things finally happened with Kate.

204
00:14:38,556 --> 00:14:40,387
-You're kidding?
-That's great.

205
00:14:40,558 --> 00:14:42,150
lt was so amazing.

206
00:14:42,326 --> 00:14:44,692
After the lovemaking...

207
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:46,921
Oh, my!

208
00:14:47,632 --> 00:14:50,465
...l just watched her sleep for hours.

209
00:14:50,635 --> 00:14:52,569
Just breathing in...

210
00:14:52,737 --> 00:14:53,897
...and breathing out.

211
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:59,209
And then l knew she was dreaming
because her eyes kept going like this:

212
00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:07,846
l'm telling you,
Joanna's got it all wrong.

213
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:11,648
All l said was, ''This was fun.
Let's do it again some time.

214
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:13,882
l'll give you a call.''

215
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:17,858
l wonder why she thinks you're going
to call her?

216
00:15:18,463 --> 00:15:20,522
That's what you say
at the end of a date.

217
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:23,531
You can't just say,
''Nice to meet you. Good night''?

218
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:26,465
To her face?

219
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:29,706
l'm so happy.

220
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,869
lt's the end of the date.
l'm standing there...

221
00:15:33,044 --> 00:15:36,912
...all she's waiting for is for me to say
l'll call her, and it just comes out.

222
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:40,482
l can't help it.
lt's a compulsion.

223
00:15:40,651 --> 00:15:45,554
When a guy says he'll call,
it doesn't mean he's going to call.

224
00:15:45,756 --> 00:15:47,815
This never happened to you?

225
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:50,017
Well, they always called.

226
00:15:50,828 --> 00:15:51,852
Bite me.

227
00:15:58,803 --> 00:16:01,203
-Did he call?
-No, sorry.

228
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:04,705
Why? He said he'd call.
Why hasn't he called?

229
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:08,972
Maybe he's intimidated by really
smart, strong, successful women.

230
00:16:09,146 --> 00:16:12,309
Sophie, will you please
climb out of my butt.

231
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:16,409
Why hasn't he called, Rachel?
Why?

232
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:21,954
Well, maybe he feels awkward
because you are my boss.

233
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:24,617
Awkward?
Why should he feel awkward?

234
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:28,390
The person that should feel awkward
is you. Did you tell him not to call me?

235
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:31,262
lf you're uncomfortable with him
dating someone you work for...

236
00:16:31,435 --> 00:16:33,903
...there are always ways to fix that.

237
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:39,799
Call her. Call her now!

238
00:16:40,645 --> 00:16:43,443
Multiple so many paper cuts.

239
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:47,315
''Why hasn't he called, Rachel?
Why, why? l don't understand!

240
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:48,611
He said he'd call. Why?''

241
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:51,880
l'm telling you, she's flipped out!
She's gone crazy!

242
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,581
Well, give me the phone then.

243
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,593
This isn't funny. She thinks
it's my fault you haven't called.

244
00:16:58,763 --> 00:17:00,230
-You have to call her.
-Look...

245
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:02,798
...you can't call somebody
after this long to say:

246
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:05,959
''ln case you didn't notice,
l don't like you.''

247
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:09,004
-Then you'll have to take her out again.
-No!

248
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:11,232
She's really dull,
and she gets this...

249
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:15,607
...gross mascara-goop thing
in the corner of her eye!

250
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:20,012
l don't care! You're gonna have
to take her out again and end it.

251
00:17:20,184 --> 00:17:22,812
And end it in a way
that she knows it's actually ended.

252
00:17:22,987 --> 00:17:26,889
l don't care how hard it is.
Don't tell her you'll call her again!

253
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:30,289
All right, fine! But it's just
a lunch date. No more than an hour.

254
00:17:30,461 --> 00:17:34,022
From now on, l get my own dates.
l don't want you setting me up again!

255
00:17:34,198 --> 00:17:36,166
That's fine!

256
00:17:36,434 --> 00:17:39,301
-That's just a lot of big talk.
-l know.

257
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,131
l'm in the shower.

258
00:17:57,955 --> 00:18:00,753
Fire! There's a fire! Fire!

259
00:18:34,925 --> 00:18:38,759
l talked to Lauren.
l told her how things were with us.

260
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:41,693
Did you talk to Marshall?

261
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:43,060
About what?

262
00:18:44,368 --> 00:18:46,734
About what happened with us.

263
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:52,798
No, and there's really no reason
why he should find out.

264
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:56,140
So let's not make a big deal
out of it, okay?

265
00:18:57,648 --> 00:18:59,616
What are you talking about?

266
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:02,082
lt was a big deal.

267
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:06,518
You can't tell me last night
didn't mean something to you.

268
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:10,149
l was there.
You're not that good an actress.

269
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:14,621
l was just caught up in the moment.

270
00:19:15,332 --> 00:19:17,630
That's all it was.

271
00:19:18,235 --> 00:19:21,204
Joey, l'm sorry you feel bad, but...

272
00:19:21,372 --> 00:19:25,103
...haven't you slept with a woman where
it meant more to her than it did to you?

273
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:26,265
No.

274
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:30,836
-Hi, Kate.
-Hi, Lauren.

275
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:34,517
-Hi, Lauren.
-Hi, pig!

276
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:43,292
-Sorry l scared you in there.
-lt's okay.

277
00:19:44,295 --> 00:19:45,592
By the way...

278
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:48,926
...l was just checking
the shower massager.

279
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:55,228
l tried to reach you at work.

280
00:19:55,406 --> 00:19:57,840
There's been a fire.

281
00:19:58,008 --> 00:20:01,136
What?
Oh, my God!

282
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:04,108
What happened?

283
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:07,182
We believe it originated here...

284
00:20:08,185 --> 00:20:10,346
...in the Aroma Room.

285
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:13,354
Did everyone get out okay?

286
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:16,687
The giraffe's okay,
and so is the pirate.

287
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:18,621
-What is this?
-No, don't look!

288
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:21,094
You don't want to see
what's under there!

289
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:26,396
The foster puppets!

290
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:35,008
lt's not a big deal. lt's right
here, and it's all the time.

291
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:40,083
Well, thanks again for lunch.

292
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:46,823
-Yes. This was pleasant.
-lt was, wasn't it?

293
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:50,992
-The food there was great.
-Wasn't it?

294
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,057
So take care.

295
00:20:55,432 --> 00:20:57,593
You too.

296
00:20:58,068 --> 00:21:01,060
This was great. l'll give you a call.
We should do it again!

297
00:21:01,238 --> 00:21:03,468
Great. l'm looking forward to it.

298
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:06,974
-Rachel, any messages?
-Sophie's desk.

299
00:21:10,681 --> 00:21:12,842
-Are you gonna call her?
-No.

300
00:21:14,285 --> 00:21:17,777
l'm sorry, okay? l'm weak
and pathetic and sorry.

301
00:21:17,955 --> 00:21:20,890
You are gonna tell her.
You'll tell her now.

302
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:22,821
l'm not gonna call you.

303
00:21:25,262 --> 00:21:26,251
What?

304
00:21:31,802 --> 00:21:35,294
l'm sorry that l said l was going to
when l'm not.

305
00:21:35,472 --> 00:21:40,432
lt's just that l was trying to be nice,
and you don't deserve that.

306
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,441
-l see. l think.
-Look, this has nothing to do with you.

307
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:48,949
And this isn't Rachel's fault.
lt's me.

308
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,316
l have serious problems
when it comes to women.

309
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:57,222
l have issues with commitment,
intimacy...

310
00:21:58,162 --> 00:22:01,131
...mascara goop.

311
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:06,963
l'm really sorry. lt's just that
this isn't going to work out.

312
00:22:09,773 --> 00:22:13,834
Well, this isn't how
l was hoping this would end...

313
00:22:14,011 --> 00:22:17,310
...but l guess l have to appreciate
your honesty.

314
00:22:17,615 --> 00:22:19,879
Yeah. Okay.

315
00:22:21,018 --> 00:22:22,610
So....

316
00:22:25,322 --> 00:22:28,382
This is great. l'll give you a call.
We should do it again!

317
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:36,559
So anyway, Beth,
what l'm saying is...

318
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:40,966
...l should have considered your
feelings before l went home with you.

319
00:22:41,138 --> 00:22:46,474
l've recently learned what it's like
to be on your side of it...

320
00:22:46,644 --> 00:22:48,737
...and l'm sorry.

321
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,408
So do you think
you can forgive me?

322
00:22:53,117 --> 00:22:55,278
Great. Thanks.

323
00:22:55,452 --> 00:22:57,477
Okay. Bye.

324
00:23:05,396 --> 00:23:07,227
Hello, Jennifer?

325
00:23:07,398 --> 00:23:10,128
Hi, Mrs. Laurio.
ls Jennifer there?

326
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:12,462
She's not home, huh?

327
00:23:12,836 --> 00:23:14,861
Well, actually,
l need to talk to you too.

328
