1
00:00:04,316 --> 00:00:06,910
Can l see the comics?

2
00:00:07,085 --> 00:00:09,417
This is the New York Times.

3
00:00:09,588 --> 00:00:12,580
Okay, may l see the comics?

4
00:00:13,325 --> 00:00:15,850
l thought you were taking
Ross to the game.

5
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:19,359
-We are. He's meeting us here.
-No, Rachel's meeting us here!

6
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:21,362
Come on!
They can be in the same room.

7
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:24,525
-You should've been there last night.
-What happened now?

8
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:26,500
Ross was hanging out at our place.

9
00:00:26,672 --> 00:00:30,836
Rachel comes over to borrow
some moisturizer from Chandler--

10
00:00:31,376 --> 00:00:36,575
How hard is it to say ''something''?
Rachel came over to borrow ''something.''

11
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:41,307
Anyway, her and Ross just started
yelling at each other.

12
00:00:41,486 --> 00:00:42,748
Why was he yelling at her?

13
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:44,980
He's the one who slept
with someone else.

14
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:47,489
He says they were on a break
when it happened...

15
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:49,524
...so she should've
forgiven him by now.

16
00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:52,755
He is so unreasonable! God!

17
00:00:52,998 --> 00:00:56,263
Although, l think l understand
what he means.

18
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:58,562
Oh, my God!
This is like 60 Minutes.

19
00:00:58,737 --> 00:01:00,329
At first, you're really mad...

20
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:03,065
...at that pharmaceutical company
for making the drug.

21
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:06,176
And then, you just feel bad
for the people...

22
00:01:06,345 --> 00:01:09,007
...because they needed
to make their hair grow.

23
00:01:09,414 --> 00:01:12,906
You know what this is like?
lt's like when my parents got divorced.

24
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:17,584
Man, l hope Ross doesn't try
to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.

25
00:01:18,357 --> 00:01:22,350
l dreamed that Ross and Rachel were
still together. They never broke up.

26
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:25,894
-We were all hanging out and happy.
-l had the same dream.

27
00:01:26,064 --> 00:01:31,024
-And nobody slept with the Xerox girl.
-Oh, l had the opposite dream.

28
00:01:31,937 --> 00:01:34,531
Maybe it's gonna be okay.
l mean, it's been a week.

29
00:01:34,706 --> 00:01:37,869
lt never takes me more than a week
to get over a relationship.

30
00:01:38,043 --> 00:01:42,776
lt's never taken you more than a shower
to get over a relationship.

31
00:01:44,182 --> 00:01:47,709
Let's go! Let's hit the road.
Let's get the show on it.

32
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:48,944
Let me get coffee.

33
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:51,817
l know the best coffeehouse.
And it's so close.

34
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,790
-Closer than here?
-Oh, look! l found coffee!

35
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:57,428
Okay, let's skedaddle.

36
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:00,257
Pheebs, l'm not gonna drink
somebody's old coffee.

37
00:02:00,432 --> 00:02:02,024
Okay, Your Highness.

38
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:14,110
''Rachel, l'm really sorry.''
''Okay, Ross. Wanna get back together?''

39
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:15,336
''Yeah, okay.''

40
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:18,244
Did anyone else hear that?

41
00:02:22,287 --> 00:02:24,755
The One Without the Ski Trip

42
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:18,506
-ls he here?
-No.

43
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:20,941
Here's your moisturizer.

44
00:03:24,082 --> 00:03:27,142
You guys are gonna love me!
Okay, check it out.

45
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,287
Thursday night, five tickets.

46
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:34,187
Calvin Klein lingerie show,
and you guys are coming with me.

47
00:03:36,928 --> 00:03:39,522
l said that out loud, right?

48
00:03:39,698 --> 00:03:43,156
Yes, it's just that
we kind of already...

49
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:45,963
...made plans with Ross.

50
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,673
Well, okay.

51
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,167
Well, there you go.

52
00:03:51,443 --> 00:03:55,971
He got this new home-theater dealie,
and he wants us to check it out.

53
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:57,843
He's really excited about it too.

54
00:03:58,016 --> 00:04:01,611
He even recorded showtimes
on his answering machine.

55
00:04:01,787 --> 00:04:03,721
-We're sorry, honey.
-lt's okay.

56
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:07,416
Rach, it's not that
we don't want to. Really.

57
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:11,020
Are we talking models
in their underwear?

58
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,221
And heels.

59
00:04:16,802 --> 00:04:19,930
Ross did ask us first,
and we set that night aside.

60
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:23,472
Come on. lf he asked you first,
it's only fair.

61
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,043
-Boy, do l feel bad!
-Oh, yeah.

62
00:04:30,215 --> 00:04:31,512
Very bad.

63
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:34,652
-Chandler, what are you doing?
-Chandler!

64
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,483
-Oh, my God!
-You're smoking again?

65
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:41,387
Well, actually, yesterday,
l was smoking again.

66
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,120
Today, l'm smoking still.

67
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:47,697
Why would you start again
after chewing all that quitting gum?

68
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:50,528
This is just like
my parents' divorce...

69
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:53,101
...which is when
l first started smoking.

70
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:56,137
Weren't you 9?

71
00:04:57,943 --> 00:04:59,535
Yeah.

72
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,973
l'm telling you something,
that first smoke after naptime....

73
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:09,747
That's great.
With my luck, that's him.

74
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:11,388
Him? Ross?

75
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:15,287
No, Hymn 253:
''His Eyes Are on the Sparrow.''

76
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:22,326
When my parents got divorced, l started
using humor as a defense mechanism.

77
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:27,367
Hi. Do you guys have weekend plans?

78
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:33,603
Because my sister says we can spend
the weekend at her cabin, skiing.

79
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:37,339
l'm asking you first, right?
l'm playing by the rules.

80
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:38,812
Absolutely.

81
00:05:38,984 --> 00:05:41,885
Chandler! You're smoking?
What are you doing?

82
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,418
Shut up!
You're not my real mom!

83
00:05:50,862 --> 00:05:56,027
Could you close that window?
My nipples could cut glass over here.

84
00:05:57,869 --> 00:06:01,828
Wait, really?
Because mine get me out of tickets.

85
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:08,406
Look, l just wanna say l really
appreciate you spending time with me.

86
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,676
lt's been a pretty hard time right now,
so l just wanna say thanks.

87
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:16,844
Can somebody else hug him?
l have to stay by the window.

88
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:23,525
Hey, how about this weekend,
we have a laser-disc marathon, okay?

89
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:29,327
And maybe a tournament
on my new dartboard?

90
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:32,959
What do you think?
Two days of darts! lt'll be great!

91
00:06:34,706 --> 00:06:38,198
-lt'll be great for next weekend.
-No, this weekend, guys.

92
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:40,537
lt'll be great for next weekend.

93
00:06:40,712 --> 00:06:43,613
l mean, ''lt'll be great.''

94
00:06:46,484 --> 00:06:47,542
What's going on?

95
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:52,816
We're sort of invited to go skiing.
You know, Rachel's sister's cabin?

96
00:06:56,294 --> 00:06:59,263
So, for the whole weekend?

97
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:02,923
We're really sorry,
but she did ask us first.

98
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:07,169
That's okay.
lf you all have to go away...

99
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:09,899
...for the first weekend
l'm alone by myself...

100
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:12,566
...then l totally, totally understand.

101
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:16,803
l can stay. l'm gonna stay.
The last time l went skiing...

102
00:07:16,982 --> 00:07:21,942
...l was afraid to jump off the chair
lift. l just went round and round.

103
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,521
We need you to drive us there
in your grandmother's cab.

104
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,354
-But you know what? l'll stay.
-No, l'll stay. He's my brother.

105
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:32,519
What, a ''pity stay''?

106
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:35,729
We're gonna have fun!

107
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,061
We can make fudge.

108
00:07:40,238 --> 00:07:41,535
''Pity food''?

109
00:07:42,507 --> 00:07:45,567
You know what?
l don't need any of you to stay.

110
00:07:45,744 --> 00:07:47,143
Nobody stays.

111
00:07:47,312 --> 00:07:50,008
Well, then, l might as well
offer to stay.

112
00:07:56,988 --> 00:08:02,358
-Does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
-You think he's still mad at us?

113
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:06,759
He's probably more mad since
you called him to borrow his goggles.

114
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:08,626
What? Mine aren't tinted.

115
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,361
-Chandler!
-What?

116
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:16,530
What does the sign say?

117
00:08:18,076 --> 00:08:20,306
''Beam me up, Jesus.''

118
00:08:21,146 --> 00:08:22,636
The ''No smoking'' sign.

119
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:26,078
There's no smoking
in my grandmother's cab.

120
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:29,186
Well, then, l have to go
to the bathroom.

121
00:08:29,354 --> 00:08:30,844
Oh, please!

122
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:34,822
No unscheduled stops.
You can go when we stop for gas.

123
00:08:34,993 --> 00:08:39,555
There's a rest stop right up there.
Come on, l really have to go!

124
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,991
Oh, now l have to go!

125
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:46,928
ls that all that it takes?

126
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:49,198
Sometimes just a small breeze....

127
00:08:56,548 --> 00:08:58,072
Here we go.

128
00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:00,843
-Brace yourself!
-What?

129
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,555
-Aren't you gonna go?
-No, thanks.

130
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:14,493
Rachel never pees in public restrooms.

131
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:20,333
They never have any paper in there.
So my rule is, ''No tissue, no tushy.''

132
00:09:26,744 --> 00:09:29,474
Well, if everybody's going....

133
00:09:30,248 --> 00:09:34,480
-Don't close it! The keys are in there!
-Oh, no, no, no!

134
00:09:34,652 --> 00:09:37,280
-What's going on?
-My lighter's in there!

135
00:09:44,362 --> 00:09:47,593
Damn! The tailpipe's
not hot enough to light this.

136
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,967
Relax. l can open this.
Anybody got a coat hanger?

137
00:09:52,137 --> 00:09:53,195
Oh, l do.

138
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:56,932
No, l took it out of my shirt
when l put it on this morning.

139
00:09:58,676 --> 00:10:00,735
So if your parents hadn't divorced...

140
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:04,780
...you'd be able to answer a question
like a normal person?

141
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:09,318
Look, l just need a wire something
to jimmy it.

142
00:10:09,487 --> 00:10:11,717
One of you give me
your bra underwire.

143
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,824
What?!

144
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:16,994
Come on!
Who has the biggest boobs?

145
00:10:17,996 --> 00:10:21,659
Whoever has the biggest boobs,
has the biggest bra and wire.

146
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,232
-No!
-lt's too expensive!

147
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:27,371
To get back in the car,
we need that wire.

148
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:29,632
Your call.

149
00:10:32,343 --> 00:10:35,471
Okay. Monica's are the biggest.

150
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,474
These tiny little non-breasts?
Please! Gotta be Rachel.

151
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:43,678
What? No, mine are deceptively small.

152
00:10:43,855 --> 00:10:48,451
l mean, l actually sometimes
stuff my bra.

153
00:10:48,626 --> 00:10:51,686
Well, then, your bra would
still be big.

154
00:10:51,863 --> 00:10:55,094
No, l stuff outside the bra.

155
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:57,734
Ladies, let's just compromise, okay?

156
00:10:57,902 --> 00:11:01,099
Phoebe, Rachel,
take off Monica's bra.

157
00:11:01,272 --> 00:11:03,433
All right, forget it, never mind.

158
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:06,099
-You can have mine.
-Thank you.

159
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:11,811
Chandler, what are you doing?
There is a trash can right there.

160
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:16,215
l thought if l littered, that crying
lndian might come by and save us.

161
00:11:18,323 --> 00:11:20,587
Okay. There.

162
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:24,785
Wow. Thank you, Phoebe.
That is very generous.

163
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:31,661
Wow. This is nice. Were you planning
on meeting somebody up there?

164
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:35,101
Okay. Now let's decide
who has the nicest ass.

165
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:39,870
And there you go!

166
00:11:44,148 --> 00:11:45,137
Chandler.

167
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:48,410
Well, at least let me smoke it
to the good part!

168
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:51,288
Okay.

169
00:11:57,161 --> 00:11:59,629
Oh, no.

170
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:02,798
-What?
-What? What's going on?

171
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:05,492
Yeah, this has happened before.

172
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,663
-So you know how to fix it?
-Yep. Put more gas in.

173
00:12:18,283 --> 00:12:20,148
Hi. What are you doing here?

174
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:23,116
l was wondering,
when you and l split up...

175
00:12:23,288 --> 00:12:27,725
...did you get the tape that was
half the last episode of M.A.S.H...

176
00:12:27,892 --> 00:12:30,417
...and half the hostages coming home?

177
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:35,532
Yeah, but now it's Susan and me in
Mexico and the hostages coming home.

178
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,362
-Where's Ben?
-He's sleeping.

179
00:12:40,071 --> 00:12:43,006
-ls this a bad time?
-Yeah, actually.

180
00:12:43,174 --> 00:12:47,372
Susan's gonna be here any minute.
lt's kind of an anniversary.

181
00:12:47,545 --> 00:12:50,343
l thought you guys
got married in January.

182
00:12:50,515 --> 00:12:53,143
-Different kind of anniversary.
-Oh.

183
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:55,776
Oh.

184
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:58,589
So anyway....

185
00:12:58,756 --> 00:13:03,625
Candles, champagne.
Yeah, anniversaries are great...

186
00:13:03,795 --> 00:13:07,060
...because love lasts forever,
you know?

187
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:10,496
Nothing like it in this lifetime.
Money in the bank.

188
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:12,499
So Rachel and l broke up.

189
00:13:13,938 --> 00:13:17,897
-God, Ross, l am so sorry.
-Yeah.

190
00:13:18,076 --> 00:13:21,273
You know what?
l wanna talk about this so much...

191
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:25,177
...when we can really get into it.
You free for dinner tomorrow?

192
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,545
-Yeah. l'd love that.
-Me too.

193
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:31,985
l guess it all started
when Rachel got this new job.

194
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:36,558
-Okay. Yeah. Triple-A can pick us up.
-Good.

195
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:39,026
-What town are we near?
-Fremont.

196
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:44,668
-Westmont. Westberg?
-Okay. Why are you answering?

197
00:13:45,103 --> 00:13:49,506
-Do you know what route we're on?
-We are definitely on Route 27.

198
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:53,041
Okay. We are at a rest stop
on Route 27.

199
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:55,406
Okay. There is no Route 27.

200
00:13:55,813 --> 00:13:58,907
-Okay. Either 93 or 76.
-l don't know. l'm sorry.

201
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:02,052
l always slept in the back
when we drove here.

202
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,748
Can you just send someone up and down
76 and check every rest stop?

203
00:14:06,924 --> 00:14:10,052
And also 93?

204
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:13,891
Okay. Yeah. No, they don't do that.

205
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:18,392
Okay. Somebody will come and save us.

206
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:23,404
Who? Have you seen a car in the last
hour and a half? We should call Ross.

207
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:28,409
-He can get a car to pick us up.
-No! l am not getting in a car with Ross!

208
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:31,912
We will just have to live here.

209
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,583
-But it's cold.
-l'm not getting in a car with him.

210
00:14:35,753 --> 00:14:40,213
-Think of something else.
-Good. Joey and Chandler are back!

211
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,324
-So the ''going for help'' went well?
-Yeah.

212
00:14:45,496 --> 00:14:49,330
Smokey Joe here got halfway
to the highway and collapsed.

213
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,264
l have the lung capacity
of a 2-year-old.

214
00:14:52,437 --> 00:14:56,396
-Then why are you smoking?
-Well, it's very unsettling.

215
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,674
Right? l mean,
it's pretty unbelievable.

216
00:15:01,846 --> 00:15:05,805
l mean, they just took off,
without even looking back.

217
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:11,046
You know, l don't need them. l've got
you guys now as friends, you and Susan.

218
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:14,186
Susan will be so pleased.

219
00:15:16,027 --> 00:15:19,895
Seven-one-seven?
Where's 7 1 7?

220
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:25,866
-You have more for Susan, right?
-No, but that's okay.

221
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,039
l'll just put out pickles
or something.

222
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,835
-Ross, thank God!
-Pheebs?

223
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:36,536
Why are you whispering?

224
00:15:36,981 --> 00:15:39,415
l ate a bug.

225
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:44,747
Hey, Rach! The tampons here are only
a penny. Let's stock up.

226
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:50,186
We ran out of gas and don't know where
we are, so we can't get a tow truck.

227
00:15:51,195 --> 00:15:53,060
Now you want a favor?

228
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:54,220
Yes, please.

229
00:15:54,432 --> 00:15:56,957
l'm sorry your car
broke down, Pheebs...

230
00:15:57,134 --> 00:16:00,331
...but l'm busy with some
real friends right now.

231
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:03,565
Please call to let me know
you got home safely.

232
00:16:03,741 --> 00:16:07,404
Hang on a second. Take my car.
Go pick up your friends.

233
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:09,239
No, l won't pick them up.

234
00:16:09,413 --> 00:16:12,780
We both know you'll do it
because you're not a jerk.

235
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:18,149
So you can sulk here, then go pick them
up, or save time and sulk in the car.

236
00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:22,156
-Rachel doesn't--
-l'm sorry Rachel dumped you for Mark...

237
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:27,764
...and you're innocent. But don't punish
your friends for what Rachel did to you.

238
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,961
Yeah, you're right.

239
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:35,094
Phoebe, hang on. Ross wants
to tell you something. What?

240
00:16:35,406 --> 00:16:37,670
You slept with someone else?

241
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:41,710
We were on a break! Okay?

242
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:47,317
We were-- We were-- Yeah.
Where are you? l'll find you.

243
00:16:47,585 --> 00:16:52,420
-You slept with another woman?
-Oh, you're one to talk.

244
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,225
Okay, done.

245
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:02,061
What's ''pleh''?

246
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:07,999
That's ''help'' spelled backwards so that
the helicopters can read it from the air.

247
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:12,805
What's ''dufus'' spelled backwards?

248
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,343
Car! Car!

249
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:22,581
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!

250
00:17:22,753 --> 00:17:24,243
-Hey!
-Hey!

251
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:28,415
-What is he doing here?
-He is saving your butt.

252
00:17:28,593 --> 00:17:33,155
Unless l'm stepping on some toes,
in which case l could just mosey on.

253
00:17:33,331 --> 00:17:36,698
l've got plenty of people
to help on the interstate.

254
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:40,132
-We need your help, please!
-Fine! Fine!

255
00:17:40,304 --> 00:17:43,398
-Hey.
-Hey.

256
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,974
Oh, no! Now it's
not gonna make any sense.

257
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:53,884
You guys, what do we do about Ross?
He drove all the way up here.

258
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:57,020
Just send him back,
and we're gonna go skiing?

259
00:17:57,188 --> 00:17:59,588
This is horrible.
lt's just horrible.

260
00:17:59,757 --> 00:18:02,726
You think we should
ask Ross to come along?

261
00:18:02,893 --> 00:18:06,090
What about Rachel?
How are we gonna even ask her?

262
00:18:06,263 --> 00:18:08,163
Ask me what?

263
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:13,767
lf it might be okay if
Ross came skiing?

264
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:16,839
-No, l wasn't gonna ask that.
-l wasn't.

265
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:21,605
You guys are unbelievable.
No, he cannot come!

266
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:24,179
-Excuse me?
-lt's horrible!

267
00:18:24,348 --> 00:18:29,376
Oh, please? Can't l come
to your special, magical cabin?

268
00:18:29,553 --> 00:18:33,284
Why would you even want to come?
You're a horrible skier.

269
00:18:33,457 --> 00:18:36,824
Hitting me where it hurts!
My ski skills!

270
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:40,222
-Here we go again.
-l can't handle this.

271
00:18:40,398 --> 00:18:42,923
l can handle it.
''Handle'' is my middle name.

272
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,536
Actually, it's the middle part
of my first name.

273
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:52,107
-All right, Pheebs, your cab's ready.
-All right. Let's go.

274
00:18:52,276 --> 00:18:54,039
-You're welcome.
-l'm sorry.

275
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:57,806
Were you speaking to me,
or sleeping with someone else?

276
00:18:58,482 --> 00:18:59,881
We were on a break!

277
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:03,646
Why don't you just put that
on your answering machine?

278
00:19:03,821 --> 00:19:08,656
lt's valid, and l'm not the only one
who thinks so. Monica agrees with me.

279
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:12,694
-What?
-l don't know.

280
00:19:13,464 --> 00:19:18,424
-You said it last night.
-What l said was that l understood.

281
00:19:18,602 --> 00:19:21,969
-Joey is the one who agreed with you.
-Okay.

282
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:24,164
Really, Joey?

283
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:26,499
What?

284
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:30,238
You know what?
There is no right or wrong here.

285
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:35,613
-l think it's obvious who's wrong here.
-Obviously not to Joey.

286
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:39,380
What?

287
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:44,784
-Joey and Monica feel the way l do!
-You and this ''innocent puppy'' act!

288
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:47,089
Guess who l am?

289
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,128
All right. You know what?
l can't even--

290
00:19:53,304 --> 00:19:57,240
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

291
00:19:57,408 --> 00:19:59,808
Look what you're doing to Chandler!

292
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,210
Look. We know that this is really,
really hard for you guys.

293
00:20:07,384 --> 00:20:10,444
You know.... You don't have
to love each other.

294
00:20:10,621 --> 00:20:14,113
You don't even have to like
each other much right now.

295
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,522
But please, find a way
to be around each other.

296
00:20:17,695 --> 00:20:19,925
And not put us in the middle.

297
00:20:20,097 --> 00:20:24,625
Yeah. l mean, otherwise, that's just it
for us hanging out together.

298
00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:27,293
You know? ls that what you want?

299
00:20:29,073 --> 00:20:31,166
Can you be civil?

300
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,873
-Yeah.
-l can.

301
00:20:36,547 --> 00:20:41,507
Good. Let's get back in the car. lt's
freezing, and my chest is unsupported.

302
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,287
Wait a second! l mean, what are
we doing? Who's going with who?

303
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:53,461
Look, you guys should go.

304
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:57,727
No. You know,
you planned this all out, and...

305
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:01,833
...l don't wanna ruin it.
So you should just go.

306
00:21:02,006 --> 00:21:06,568
-You drove all the way up here.
-l've got to take the car back anyway.

307
00:21:06,744 --> 00:21:10,373
l'm spending all day tomorrow
with Ben. lt's fine, okay?

308
00:21:10,548 --> 00:21:13,244
Just go. No guilt. l promise.

309
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:16,379
Thank you.

310
00:21:18,522 --> 00:21:20,649
We'll call you when we get back.

311
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:23,851
Maybe we can, like,
go to a movie or something.

312
00:21:24,028 --> 00:21:26,223
Or the rodeo!

313
00:21:27,064 --> 00:21:29,555
-That would be great.
-Okay.

314
00:21:30,668 --> 00:21:34,297
l was being Shelley Winters
from The Poseidon Adventure.

315
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,735
l know.

316
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:47,312
Bye!

317
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:13,372
-Ross.
-Hi. Sorry l'm late.

318
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:15,774
-Were you sleeping?
-No.

319
00:22:15,946 --> 00:22:18,380
Oh, great, because....

320
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:22,611
l had to get you a new battery.
l got the best l could.

321
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:25,619
-That's not where you wanna skimp.
-You're a genius.

322
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:30,192
lt came to about $ 1 1 2. But what
the hell? Just call it an even 1 1 0?

323
00:22:30,361 --> 00:22:32,886
Okay. l'll pay you
tomorrow, Ross. Bye!

324
00:22:33,063 --> 00:22:38,831
So they all took off. lt was pretty hard
watching them go, you know?

325
00:22:39,003 --> 00:22:40,265
Yeah, okay. Bye.

326
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:47,035
So l'm gonna take off, then.

327
00:22:47,611 --> 00:22:48,600
