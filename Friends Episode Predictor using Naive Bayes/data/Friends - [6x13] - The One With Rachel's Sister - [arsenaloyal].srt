1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,300
Okay, Rach, that's muffin
and espresso, $4.50.

2
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:09,998
Ross, double latte, $2.75.
Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25.

3
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:12,643
And Phoebe, herbal tea, $1.25.

4
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,540
All together that's $12.75.

5
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:20,147
This coming from the man who couldn't
split our $80 phone bill in half.

6
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,580
How much do I owe you?

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,987
That's on the house,
courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.

8
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,126
Great. Well, tell him thanks.

9
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:33,423
And since Joey seems like
such a nice guy...

10
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,133
maybe we could go out?

11
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,893
He's not used to women
being so forward...

12
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,004
but I could check with him.
He says it's okay.

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,139
Great. Thanks. Bye-bye.

14
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,646
How come our stuff isn't free?

15
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:51,112
It will be when you look like
that in a tight skirt.

16
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:53,643
I'm getting more dates than ever.

17
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,822
You're only giving free stuff
to the pretty girls?

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,990
Joey, that is so gross!

19
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,091
How about a scone on the house, baby?

20
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,257
I'm pretty.

21
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,601
The One With Rachel's Sister

22
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:48,571
-Hey, does anyone have any gum?
-I do.

23
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,936
Here. Sorry.

24
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,712
Oh, you know what?

25
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,611
No.

26
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,554
Wait a second.

27
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,797
-I know it's in here.
-You know what? I'm good.

28
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,296
Sorry, I guess it's in my big bag.

29
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,197
Say, does anybody have a goldfish?

30
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,408
Why are you here?
Shouldn't you be at work?

31
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,740
They sent me home.
They said I can't work if I'm sick.

32
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,209
-Sorry you're sick.
-I'm not sick!

33
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,591
I don't get sick. Getting sick is
for weaklings, it's for pansies.

34
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,919
No one thinks that you're a pansy...

35
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,960
but we do think
that you need a tissue.

36
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,831
I have not been sick
in over three years.

37
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,569
I think you're sick because
that used to be in your nose.

38
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,304
I'll get tissue.

39
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,673
I don't need a tissue. I'm fine-d.

40
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,442
When you put a D
at the end of fine...

41
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,777
you're not fine.

42
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,612
I'm fine-d.

43
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,783
I'm fine-d.

44
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:17,195
It's a really hard word to say.

45
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:33,071
-Yes?
-Hi. Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.

46
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,473
Oh, my God, Jill!

47
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,609
Oh, my God, Rachel!

48
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,711
Oh, my God, introduce us.

49
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,449
This is Chandler.
And you know Monica and Ross.

50
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,924
And that's Phoebe.
And that's Joey.

51
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,916
-How you doing?
-Don't!

52
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,426
Honey, what are you doing here?

53
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:56,795
Which sister is this?

54
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,005
Is this the spoiled one
or the one that bit her?

55
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,467
Daddy cut me off.

56
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,266
Never mind, I got it.

57
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,175
You know what I said?

58
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,846
I said, "I'll hire a lawyer,
sue you, take all your money...

59
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,572
and cut you off!"

60
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,250
Wow. What did he say?

61
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,248
That he wouldn't pay
for my lawyer.

62
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,156
Then he told me to learn
the value of money...

63
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,949
from the one daughter
he's actually proud of.

64
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,593
Did you hear that?
My dad's proud of me.

65
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,264
My dad's proud of me.

66
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,761
-Rach?
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.

67
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,370
Honey, so what did you do
that made Dad cut you off?

68
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,774
Okay, I bought a boat.

69
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,475
You bought a boat?

70
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,169
It wasn't for me,
it was for a friend.

71
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,048
Boy, did we make friends
with the wrong sister.

72
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,683
I knew it was stupid and
I shouldn't have done it...

73
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:52,018
but she bought me all these CDs
and said I had a cute haircut.

74
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,626
And your daddy didn't understand?

75
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,891
I know, and usually I just cry
and say I'm sorry and he forgives me.

76
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,934
Oh, yes, good criers, the Green girls.

77
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,734
I mean, the Green sisters.

78
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,610
Man, no matter how you say it...

79
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,409
it still sounds like you're
talking about green people.

80
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,912
I'm at rock bottom.

81
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,285
This is the best thing that
could've happened to you.

82
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,684
You've needed to get out on your own.

83
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:31,920
When I did it, at first I was scared,
but then look at me now.

84
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,429
I am the only daughter
that Dad is proud of.

85
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,033
I can't believe him.
How does he expect me to buy stuff?

86
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,198
Maybe, you know, you
won't buy stuff for a while.

87
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,310
I don't understand.

88
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,975
This is what you'll do.
You're gonna get a job.

89
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,082
You're gonna get an apartment.

90
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,481
And then you will live off
the money that you earn.

91
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,521
Okay, I know this is what you did...

92
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,920
but that doesn't sound like me.

93
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,052
Okay, but it can be. It can be you.

94
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:06,255
And you can stay with us.
Right, Phoebe?

95
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,026
-Of course, yeah.
-Oh, that's so great!

96
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:12,863
Okay, I'm really gonna do this.
I don't know how to thank you.

97
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,233
Oh, I like cars.

98
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:22,971
-You all finished?
-Yes.

99
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,648
Great.

100
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,922
Okay, here are the tips
for this morning.

101
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,183
Jen gets 50, 50 for me
and Joey owes 8 dollars.

102
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,024
-What?
-For all the free food you gave away.

103
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,167
If it's free, how come
you're charging me for it?

104
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,336
We don't give anything away
unless it's a birthday.

105
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:50,032
What if they came in third
in a modeling contest?

106
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,299
No.

107
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,909
Sorry.

108
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,145
I just had the hardest day.
Some of these are so heavy.

109
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,688
How did you pay? I thought
your dad took your credit card.

110
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,485
I memorized those numbers
when I was 15.

111
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,898
But look at all the cool
make-it-on-my-own stuff I got!

112
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,067
This is my "Please hire me" sweater.

113
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:20,362
And these are my "Don't you want
to rent me this apartment?" pants.

114
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:26,208
Charging clothes to your dad doesn't
qualify as making it on your own.

115
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,571
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get
all technical.

116
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,041
Rachel's not gonna think
it's a good idea.

117
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:37,345
-So who made her queen of the world?
-I would love that job!

118
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,191
What's going on?

119
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,928
Jill!

120
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,363
Did you shop?

121
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,565
No.

122
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,960
They did.

123
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,297
Yeah, we went shopping!

124
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,272
You went shopping?

125
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,639
Then you came here
and paraded it under Jill's nose...

126
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,642
when you know she's trying to quit.
That's terrible.

127
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,148
Sorry, Jill.

128
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,784
So, what'd you get?

129
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,319
Oh, well, all right. Thank you.

130
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:15,288
I got this, you know,
"I want a job" sweater.

131
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:21,497
And then I got..
These are apartment pants.

132
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,627
Apartment pants?

133
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,571
You've never heard of them?

134
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,565
Of course I've heard of them.

135
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,638
Ross, what'd you get?

136
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,278
I got this...

137
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,849
This.

138
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,785
-A pashmina?
-Yeah!

139
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,259
I love these babies.

140
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,355
Really?

141
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,827
What's a pashmina?

142
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,764
It's a rug.

143
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:00,996
Jill?

144
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,902
I'm sorry, Rachel.

145
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:09,814
You think that's gonna work on me?
I invented that.

146
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,278
Right! But I am sorry.

147
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,948
It's okay.
One little setback is okay.

148
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,556
-But don't let it happen again, okay?
-Okay.

149
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:25,127
Now, since Daddy paid for all this
stuff, I should take it all away.

150
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,528
But I'm just gonna take the pashmina.

151
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,066
And the pants.

152
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,570
I'll take it all, because that way,
you'll learn the lesson.

153
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,708
Alrighty.

154
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,678
I'm gonna run a couple of errands
and I will see you at dinner.

155
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,920
She took all my stuff.

156
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:53,818
Yeah. Everything but
the little blue one.

157
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,357
That's the best one!

158
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,155
Oh, my God. Thank you so much!

159
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,229
Well, hey.

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,458
Oh, my gosh, that was so lame.
Like a pashmina could be a rug.

161
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,367
Oh, yeah? How about you
with the "I'm sorry"?

162
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,735
Shut up! I wasn't like that at all.

163
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:15,107
What about what I said about
the apartment pants? How dumb was l?

164
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,548
-Were you this cute in high school?
-Oh, stop.

165
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,222
-No, you stop.
-No, you stop.

166
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,751
Why don't I sit here
and then you'll both stop it?

167
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,097
Okay. So, what do you want to do?

168
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,699
Let's do something crazy.

169
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,927
I know, let's rest and drink
lots of fluids.

170
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,437
Okay, I'll rest.

171
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:46,203
But if I'm going to bed,
then you're coming with me.

172
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:51,644
See, that would be impossible
to resist if you weren't all...

173
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,282
drippy here.

174
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:59,623
Are you saying that you don't
want to get with this?

175
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,293
I don't think you should say that
even when you're healthy.

176
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,894
Come on.

177
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,837
Don't take this personally.

178
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,805
I just can't have sex
with a sick person.

179
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,173
I'm with you. I can't have sex with
a sick person either. Disgusting!

180
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,509
But I'm not sick!

181
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,942
Let me prove it to you.

182
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:33,948
We are two healthy people
in the prime of lime.

183
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:39,287
See, that's the thing, I would like
to stay in the "prime of lime."

184
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,273
Oh, okay, now I'll do it.

185
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,003
Hey. What's up?

186
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,806
I think there's something
you should know.

187
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,678
Better not be about
the apartment pants.

188
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:05,085
I just pitched the idea to my boss
at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.

189
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,121
No. It's just, I was...

190
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,487
I was with Ross and Jill
after you left...

191
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,995
and I'm pretty sure I saw
a little spark between them.

192
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,033
-What?
-I mean, it's probably nothing.

193
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,569
But I wanted to warn you
that there might be something.

194
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,835
-With Ross and Jill?
-Yeah.

195
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,374
With Ross and my sister?

196
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,577
With my sister Jill
and my ex-boyfriend Ross?

197
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,787
-Oh, there is no way.
-Okay, then.

198
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,923
Oh, my God! I cannot believe that!

199
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,527
I don't like it when he dates anyone,
but my sister?

200
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,753
Isn't that incest or something?

201
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,866
And they're gonna have sex.

202
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,335
Oh, no! What if he marries her too?

203
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,062
This is just terrible.
This is just terrible.

204
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,673
And I can't stop it.
I don't own Ross.

205
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,845
And Jill should be able to do
what she wants to do.

206
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,015
Oh, my God, I can't believe Ross
is marrying my little sister.

207
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,515
This is the worst thing that
could've ever happened to me.

208
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,122
But great news about
the apartment pants, huh?

209
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,085
That'll be $3.85.

210
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,229
What? Yesterday you said
I was too pretty to pay.

211
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,963
It's just, I can't,
because my manager said that I..

212
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,767
Happy birthday to you

213
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,271
Happy birthday to you

214
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,411
-Happy birthday, dear Annie..
-Amy!

215
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,773
Amy

216
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,243
Happy birthday to you

217
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,384
That's weird,
today's my birthday too.

218
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,452
Not in here, it isn't.

219
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,789
Sorry I'm late. What's up?

220
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:55,259
I just wanted to see if there were
any leads on the old job front.

221
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,561
No. But I walked past three sales
and didn't go in.

222
00:13:58,804 --> 00:13:59,998
How strong am I?

223
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,938
That is great.

224
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:06,575
You know who doesn't have to
job-hunt? Ross.

225
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,178
-He works at the university.
-Yeah?

226
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:13,246
So you guys talked? So you get along?
So you're gonna go out?

227
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,849
Me go out with Ross? No.

228
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,524
God, no.
What would make you think that?

229
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,252
Phoebe...

230
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,759
said she thought she saw something
between you guys.

231
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,761
I mean, he's nice.

232
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,458
He's the kind you're friends with,
but not the kind you date.

233
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,299
He's the kind you date,
because you did. But me?

234
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,440
Not so much.

235
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:43,881
Oh, not so much. What do you mean?
Is there something wrong with Ross?

236
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,844
No, no, no. He's just...

237
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,985
I don't know.
You know, he's just a little bookish.

238
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,847
Are you saying he's a geek?

239
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,682
You think so too?

240
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,025
No. Ross is not a geek.

241
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,127
Then let's just say
he's not my type.

242
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,857
Handsome is not your type?

243
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,830
Smart, kind, good kisser.

244
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,232
What, those things aren't
on your list?

245
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,169
Ross is great.
You'd be lucky to be with him.

246
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,236
If it means that much,
then I'll ask him out.

247
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,037
Oh, no. That's not what I meant.

248
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,010
You know what? You're right.

249
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,548
He has been really nice to me.

250
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,211
Yeah, but he's not your type.

251
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,388
But maybe that's good.

252
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,684
I'm doing all these different things.

253
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,862
Maybe I should just try
dating a geek too.

254
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,730
Yeah, but you don't want
to try too much too fast.

255
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,928
You remember what happened
to the little girl who...

256
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,230
tried too much too fast, don't you?

257
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,001
What?

258
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,009
She died, Jill.

259
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,313
Chandler!

260
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,992
What is it, honey?
You need some tea? Some soup?

261
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,894
Calling Dr. Big.

262
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,363
Dr. Big to the bed.

263
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,703
Jeez, honey,
I thought you were asleep.

264
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:20,637
How could I be asleep knowing
that you were in the next room?

265
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,509
I was asleep.

266
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,287
No, honey. You know what's sexy?
Layers.

267
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,289
Layers are sexy.

268
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:37,154
And blankets are sexy.
And hot-water bottles are sexy.

269
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,024
Get into bed.
I want to prove I'm not sick.

270
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,968
I want to make you feel
as good as I feel.

271
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,696
Would you please get some rest?

272
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,567
I'm fine.

273
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,240
-You're coughing.
-No, I'm not.

274
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,447
No, I'm not, I'm laughing.

275
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:04,081
-At what?
-Just something I heard before.

276
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:09,819
-Tell me.
-No, I don't want it to spoil the mood.

277
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,127
Happy birthday to you

278
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,808
-You're paying for that.
-No, it's her birthday.

279
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,739
You've sung "Happy Birthday"
to 20 women today.

280
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:32,174
You are no longer authorized
to distribute birthday muffins.

281
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,418
Damn it!

282
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,989
Did you tell your sister
to ask me out?

283
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,862
-Well, yeah.
-Oh, wow! I mean, wow.

284
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,130
I think she's cute, but...

285
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,601
I never would've thought of
going out with her. Never!

286
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,265
Really?

287
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,807
But after you said it's okay,
I figured, "Why not?"

288
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,840
Oh, so not really "never."

289
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,842
I have to say you are
a much bigger person than I am.

290
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,713
I mean, after all we've been through.

291
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,385
I wish I had a brother
to reciprocate.

292
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,461
If you ever date Monica,
you have my blessing.

293
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,187
And mine.

294
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,192
Chandler?

295
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,736
I think I'm sick.

296
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,028
Really?

297
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,331
Struck down in the "pribe of libe."

298
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:36,580
Okay, fine, I admit it.
I feel terrible.

299
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,248
Will you please rub this on my chest?

300
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:44,016
No, no, no.
You are not getting me this way.

301
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,589
Come on, I really need your help here.

302
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,021
-Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
-Okay.

303
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:16,013
So you're just kind of
rubbing it on yourself?

304
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,787
-Yeah.
-It's nice.

305
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,860
You kidding me?
Is this turning you on?

306
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,595
Yes.

307
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,567
Is it the rubbing or the smell?

308
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,360
It's all very, very good.

309
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,609
So you want to go...

310
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,872
mix it up?

311
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,551
-Not now, I'm sick.
-Oh, come on, you big faker!

312
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,053
What about never sleeping
with sick people?

313
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:56,417
Well, that was before
all the vaporizing action.

314
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,721
Okay, if you really
want to have sex.

315
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,169
Worked like a charm.

316
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:12,666
Why are you here?

317
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:17,478
This is where Ross and I are meeting
for our date. So, what do you think?

318
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,242
I don't like it.

319
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,783
-Really?
-It's kind of slutty.

320
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,815
It's yours.

321
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,860
Yeah, well, I'm a slut.

322
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:34,760
Me too.

323
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:39,968
Hi, Jill.

324
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,469
Hi...

325
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,007
Rachel.

326
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,203
You're not at home,
you're right here.

327
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:50,873
Yeah, I know.

328
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:55,313
And I bet you thought it would
be weird. But it's not.

329
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,125
Okay.

330
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,054
So, well, I'll...

331
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,321
I'll have her home by midnight.

332
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,653
Why aren't you home yet?

333
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,980
Is someone there?

334
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,355
Oh, yeah, it's me. Sorry.

335
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,759
What are you doing here?

336
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,927
I'm just looking out your window...

337
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,565
at the view.

338
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,334
What are you guys doing?

339
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,535
We got some vapor rub in some places.

340
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,343
He brought her back to his apartment.

341
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,679
Who?

342
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,450
Is that your sister?

343
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:09,057
She is a slut!

344
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,598
Ross is on a date with your sister.
How weird is that?

345
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,366
Oh, my God, he's taking off
her clothes!

346
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,963
He's taking off her coat.

347
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,432
Oh, this is just terrible.

348
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,773
Oh, no, it's not. It's a first date.
I'm sure that nothing is gonna...

349
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,310
He's gonna get some.

350
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,921
Of the glare...

351
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,053
from the streetlight
out of his apartment.

352
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:47,225
You know, so he's closed
the drapes there...

353
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,230
so he can have a nice, pleasant...

354
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:53,302
conversation with
your little sister.

355
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,664
Well, I'm off to bed.

356
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,749
I don't feel good.

357
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,018
You better not get me sick.

358
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:21,724
I need some fruit
or some juice or some....

359
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,168
Or some nothing.

360
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,465
There's nothing in here.
Who took our food?

361
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:33,600
Can I interest you in a slice
of lasagna or a drumstick?

362
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,873
-No, thanks.
-Are you sure? It's on the house.

363
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,710
-No, thanks.
-How about going out with me Friday night?

364
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,479
-No, thanks.
-What are you gonna do.
