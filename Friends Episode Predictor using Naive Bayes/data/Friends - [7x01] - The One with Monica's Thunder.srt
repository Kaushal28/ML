1
00:00:03,215 --> 00:00:04,580
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,148
I found a note on my door,
''Come to Monica's.

3
00:00:07,352 --> 00:00:10,412
Bring champagne
and a Three Musketeers bar.''

4
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:12,146
Yeah, I'II take that.

5
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:14,017
What's up?

6
00:00:14,226 --> 00:00:17,718
-Monica and I are engaged.
-Oh, my God.

7
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:24,758
CongratuIations. Where is she?

8
00:00:25,037 --> 00:00:27,767
I'm engaged! I'm engaged!

9
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:31,903
She's been there for 20 minutes.
You didn't hear?

10
00:00:32,177 --> 00:00:34,873
I thought it was a kid yeIIing,
''I'm gay!''

11
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:38,613
No, that guy moved.

12
00:00:39,918 --> 00:00:43,251
-Can I bring her in?
-Let her stay. It's sweet.

13
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:47,423
I'm getting married!
I'm gonna be a bride!

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,388
No, I wiII not shut up,
because I'm engaged!

15
00:00:53,632 --> 00:00:57,625
Oh, big taIk! Why don't you
come here and say that to me?

16
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:00,565
My fiancé wiII kick your ass.

17
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:05,175
Come on, apartment 20, apartment 20.

18
00:01:06,778 --> 00:01:10,077
You get her in, you boIt the door,
I'II be in the cIoset.

19
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,676
The One with Monica's Thunder

20
00:01:48,553 --> 00:01:50,851
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

21
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:58,353
I just want to say that I Iove
you guys so, so much...

22
00:01:58,597 --> 00:02:01,930
...and thank you for being here
on my speciaI night.

23
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:04,124
Our speciaI night.

24
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:08,135
It just wouIdn't be my night--
Our night...

25
00:02:08,373 --> 00:02:12,241
...if you weren't here to ceIebrate
with me-- Us. Damn it!

26
00:02:12,477 --> 00:02:15,878
It's okay,
I want this to be your night too.

27
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:17,771
To Monica.

28
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,847
Come on, wait, stop it.

29
00:02:20,152 --> 00:02:21,414
Okay, to Monica.

30
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:28,458
Have you decided on a band for the
wedding? Because I'm kind of musicaI.

31
00:02:29,294 --> 00:02:32,786
She got engaged a few hours ago,
I doubt she's had time to think--

32
00:02:32,998 --> 00:02:36,365
Speaking of chiming in, remember the time
you burned down my apartment?

33
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,867
Yeah, you're on your own.

34
00:02:40,572 --> 00:02:44,269
We shouId get dressed up
and go have champagne at the PIaza.

35
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:47,903
I can't stay too Iong.

36
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:51,582
I gotta get up earIy for an audition.
I gotta Iook good.

37
00:02:51,817 --> 00:02:54,445
I'm supposed to be pIaying
a 1 9-year-oId.

38
00:02:56,621 --> 00:02:57,645
What?

39
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:01,325
So when you said get up earIy,
did you mean 1 986?

40
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:05,092
You guys don't think I Iook 1 9?

41
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,534
Oh, 1 9! We thought you said 90.

42
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:16,333
Okay, everybody, Iet's go.

43
00:03:20,045 --> 00:03:22,104
Is my candy bar around here?

44
00:03:22,347 --> 00:03:23,678
No, you ate it aII.

45
00:03:23,915 --> 00:03:25,974
I was afraid of that.

46
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:36,823
You know what shoes wouId Iook great
with this ring?

47
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:38,723
Diamond shoes.

48
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:43,125
You're not getting dressed.

49
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:49,806
Know what I mean?

50
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:54,445
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.

51
00:03:54,646 --> 00:03:56,307
There's gonna be a wedding.

52
00:03:56,548 --> 00:03:58,072
You're gonna be the bride.

53
00:03:58,316 --> 00:04:02,514
200 peopIe are gonna be Iooking at you
in a cIean, white dress.

54
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:04,945
Let's do it.

55
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:14,195
So are you the fairest one of aII?

56
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:18,128
-I can stiII pIay 1 9, right?
-Yeah, but you gotta dress younger.

57
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,999
If you wear the right cIothes,
you can Iook any age.

58
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:23,107
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah. I work in fashion...

59
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:25,243
...and fashion is aII about youth.

60
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:28,138
Fashion is about me?

61
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:31,009
About youth. Youth!
Listen up, grandpa.

62
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:42,925
ChandIer, it happens to Iots of guys.

63
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:47,056
You're tired,
you had a Iot of champagne.

64
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:49,165
Don't worry about it.

65
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:54,627
I'm not worried. I'm fascinated.

66
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,034
You know? It's Iike bioIogy.

67
00:04:58,243 --> 00:05:01,770
Which is funny, because in high schooI
I faiIed bioIogy...

68
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:04,811
...and tonight bioIogy faiIed me.

69
00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:10,982
Check it out. I couId pIay this
whiIe the guests are coming in. Okay.

70
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:16,926
<i>Twelve years old and addicted to p[ork</i>

71
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:20,064
<i>No one thought Monica would marry</i>

72
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:25,291
<i>She knew her way</i>
<i>Around a knife and a fork</i>

73
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,097
Phoebe, that's great, but--

74
00:05:27,272 --> 00:05:31,072
So you're not convinced. That's aII right
because I got another one.

75
00:05:32,777 --> 00:05:37,771
<i>First time I met Chandler</i>
<i>I thought he was gay</i>

76
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:44,215
<i>But here I am singing</i>
<i>On his wedding day</i>

77
00:05:46,358 --> 00:05:47,791
Phoebe, no.

78
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,492
If you'd Iet me finish, it goes on
to say that he's probabIy not gay.

79
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:58,992
You guys don't have this probIem,
you're made of wood.

80
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:04,537
Hey, you Iook great.

81
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:06,267
Thanks.

82
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:08,207
You okay over there?

83
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:12,742
I don't know. You know?
I feeI a IittIe....

84
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,945
You know what? Never mind.
I'II be fine.

85
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:22,956
Don't worry about it. You're probabIy
tired, you had a Iot of champagne.

86
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:25,792
It happens to everybody.

87
00:06:31,102 --> 00:06:34,128
-Happy Monica's Night.
-WeII, thank you. You too.

88
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:37,569
Can you beIieve
they are actuaIIy getting married?

89
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:40,836
WeII, sure,
but I get married aII the time.

90
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:46,640
-You okay?
-Yeah, I guess.

91
00:06:48,553 --> 00:06:51,317
Do you think we'II ever have that?

92
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:54,288
You mean ''we,'' you and me?

93
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:56,858
Oh, no, no, no.

94
00:06:57,128 --> 00:06:59,358
''We,'' you with someone,
me with someone.

95
00:06:59,597 --> 00:07:01,258
Good, you scared me a minute.

96
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:03,330
I know. Shake it off.

97
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:08,568
It's just because you and I,
we were Iike a nightmare.

98
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:15,203
-No, but there were some good times.
-AbsoIuteIy. Like, there was....

99
00:07:17,282 --> 00:07:21,275
-SureIy you can think of something.
-<i>J</i>ust give me a minute.

100
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:25,221
Oh, weII, yes.

101
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,357
I can think of one good thing.

102
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:35,658
You were aIways good at the...

103
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:39,834
...stuff.

104
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:46,639
I was good at the stuff?

105
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,243
I reaIIy Iiked your hands.

106
00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:52,142
My hands?

107
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,887
Way to go, guys.

108
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,317
You were reaIIy good at the stuff too.

109
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:02,992
Oh, I know.

110
00:08:06,965 --> 00:08:09,365
What are you thinking about?

111
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:11,729
<i>J</i>ust some stuff.

112
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:14,765
Hey, you know what we never did?

113
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:17,166
Oh, no, not that.

114
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,541
We never had a bonus night.

115
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:22,269
-A what?
-You know, a bonus night.

116
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:26,281
Two peopIe break up, but they
get back together for one night.

117
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:31,254
One night, just se<i>x</i>?
No strings attached?

118
00:08:31,456 --> 00:08:34,584
-Yeah, yeah, we never had that.
-No.

119
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:43,892
Okay, this is getting a IittIe crazy.

120
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:49,132
I'm sure it wouId be amazing...

121
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,605
...but I reaIIy don't think
it wouId be a good idea.

122
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:54,607
I reaIIy...

123
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:57,074
...reaIIy...

124
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:59,344
...don't.

125
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:10,417
WeII, at Ieast I can stiII do some things.

126
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,535
'Sup?

127
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:30,674
'Sup, dude?

128
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,245
Take whatever you want,
just don't hurt me.

129
00:09:36,454 --> 00:09:38,786
You pIaying
a IittIe PIayStation, huh?

130
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,224
That's whack.

131
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:46,230
PIayStation is whack.

132
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:50,791
'Sup with the whack PIayStation,
'sup?

133
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:56,666
Come on, am I 1 9 or what?

134
00:09:56,941 --> 00:10:01,310
Yes, on a scaIe of one to ten, ten
being the dumbest a person can Iook...

135
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:03,547
...you are definiteIy 1 9.

136
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:06,575
Come on, reaIIy. How oId?

137
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:09,378
Young. You're a man-chiId, okay?

138
00:10:09,587 --> 00:10:14,718
Now get changed, everybody's ready.
And pIease, pIease, keep my underwear.

139
00:10:15,493 --> 00:10:17,120
Thanks.

140
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:30,134
You've had a Iot of se<i>x</i>, right?

141
00:10:33,244 --> 00:10:35,075
When, today?

142
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:39,909
Some, not a Iot.

143
00:10:41,352 --> 00:10:45,083
The reason I'm asking
is because I had kind of a--

144
00:10:45,657 --> 00:10:47,352
I was unabIe to--

145
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,922
I reaIIy wanted to, but I couIdn't--

146
00:10:52,397 --> 00:10:56,493
I cannot beIieve I'm asking advice
from somebody who's wearing that hat.

147
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:01,805
I had an incident.

148
00:11:03,374 --> 00:11:06,434
Don't worry about that, man.
That happens.

149
00:11:06,911 --> 00:11:10,210
-It's happened to you?
-Yeah, once.

150
00:11:10,782 --> 00:11:14,149
-WeII, what'd you do?
-I did it anyway.

151
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:20,851
Phoebe, come on, Iet's go.

152
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:22,724
Come on.

153
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:26,286
Why aren't you dressed yet?

154
00:11:26,564 --> 00:11:29,055
I wrote the best song
for your wedding.

155
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,597
Check this out.

156
00:11:30,935 --> 00:11:33,130
If you get ready now, you can pIay.

157
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:34,429
-ReaIIy?!
-Yes.

158
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,130
That's so e<i>x</i>citing! Thanks, Mon.

159
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:42,004
But if you touch my guitar again,
I'II have to pound on you a IittIe bit.

160
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:45,141
Fair enough. Get ready.
I'II get everybody.

161
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:48,284
FinaIIy we can start ceIebrating my--

162
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:55,286
I'm sorry, apparentIy I opened
the door to the past.

163
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:03,192
Okay, Monica, Mon.
Okay, what you just saw--

164
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:07,165
Can I ask you just a IittIe <i>q</i>uestion?
Why tonight?

165
00:12:08,473 --> 00:12:10,941
I waited my whoIe Iife
to be engaged...

166
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:14,472
...and unIike some,
I onIy pIan on doing this once.

167
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:21,612
Maybe it's seIfish, I'm sorry, but I
hoped tonight couId just be about that.

168
00:12:21,819 --> 00:12:23,616
But it is just about that.

169
00:12:23,821 --> 00:12:26,255
Now it's about you
getting back together.

170
00:12:26,457 --> 00:12:29,119
See, you kind of stoIe my thunder.

171
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:33,963
We did not steaI your thunder.
We are not getting back together.

172
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:37,463
Yeah, no, and you know what?
Nobody even saw.

173
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,232
That's true.

174
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:43,403
-We just kissed.
-It was just a kiss.

175
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:44,903
You guys kissed?!

176
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:48,776
What does this mean?!

177
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,949
Are you back together?
Can I sing at your wedding?

178
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:55,218
Thunder being stoIen.

179
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,981
-Phoebe, it's nothing.
-Let's not make a big deaI of this.

180
00:12:59,257 --> 00:13:02,158
It was a one-time thing.
It doesn't even matter.

181
00:13:02,427 --> 00:13:03,758
Oh, my God.

182
00:13:05,797 --> 00:13:08,595
I cannot beIieve you guys
are taIking about this.

183
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,667
ProbIems in the bedroom
are between a man and a woman.

184
00:13:13,538 --> 00:13:17,269
AII right? Now, ChandIer
is doing the best he can.

185
00:13:20,478 --> 00:13:23,504
I don't think that's
what they were taIking about.

186
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:27,043
No, but Iet's taIk about it.

187
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:30,615
What a great night.
ChandIer can't do it, they kissed.

188
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:33,253
-What?
-You guys kissed? This is huge.

189
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,516
No, it's not huge.

190
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:37,659
PeopIe thinking it's huge
has Ied Monica to beIieve...

191
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:40,124
...we're steaIing her thunder,
which we aren't.

192
00:13:40,665 --> 00:13:42,257
We're stiII taIking about it.

193
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,934
That and ChandIer's probIem.

194
00:13:46,471 --> 00:13:48,166
Monica, Iisten, Iisten.

195
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:52,035
WouId you feeI better if we stopped
taIking about Ross and RacheI?

196
00:13:52,276 --> 00:13:54,141
-That wouId be IoveIy.
-You got it.

197
00:13:54,412 --> 00:13:57,347
Now, I can pass for 1 9, right?

198
00:13:57,949 --> 00:13:59,507
Yes, you can pass for 1 9.

199
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:01,207
-ReaIIy?
-Yes.

200
00:14:01,686 --> 00:14:03,483
-SeriousIy?
-SeriousIy?

201
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:08,681
SeriousIy, no. Okay? You can pIay
your own age, which is 31 .

202
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:13,490
I'm 30!

203
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:17,125
<i>J</i>oey, you are not. You're 31 .

204
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:20,036
Oh, crap!

205
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:25,469
So the PIaza. We'II get some mai
tais? Maybe no more for you though.

206
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:31,744
You know, I think I don't feeI Iike
going to the PIaza.

207
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:33,712
Monica, this is ridicuIous.

208
00:14:34,218 --> 00:14:38,086
I don't want to taIk about it.
I don't. EspeciaIIy with you.

209
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:42,650
That is whack.

210
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:57,732
I'II pIay it at the wedding.

211
00:14:57,975 --> 00:15:01,376
We'II see if they actuaIIy
Iet you pIay.

212
00:15:01,612 --> 00:15:03,978
They teII you anything
you want to hear...

213
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:05,876
...Iike, ''You Iook 1 9.''

214
00:15:06,117 --> 00:15:09,780
Then they just take it away,
Iike, ''No, you don't.''

215
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:13,223
Monica won't take this away.

216
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:16,189
-WouIdn't she?
-WouId she?

217
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:18,361
WouId she?

218
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:21,426
WouId she?

219
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,930
WouId she?

220
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,967
It's starting
to sound Iike ''wood cheese.''

221
00:15:26,804 --> 00:15:29,796
Man, I couId go
for some wood cheese right now.

222
00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:36,477
Guess who.

223
00:15:38,516 --> 00:15:42,680
Hey, I just reaIized we kind of Ieft
some stuff up in the air.

224
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,351
What did Monica mean:

225
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:46,716
''I don't want to taIk,''
especiaIIy with me?

226
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:49,926
Why not especiaIIy you and me?
We were both kissing.

227
00:15:50,294 --> 00:15:51,386
StiII thinking about it?

228
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:55,087
I'm serious. What did she mean
by that? ''EspeciaIIy you.''

229
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:57,267
-Who cares?
-I care.

230
00:15:57,502 --> 00:15:58,901
And so do I.

231
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:05,901
I have to taIk to her.
WiII you Iet me get changed?

232
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:11,538
Am I going to Iet you watch me?

233
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:12,875
No.

234
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:17,287
I can't beIieve her.
It's just so typicaI.

235
00:16:17,555 --> 00:16:21,821
I know you're upset, but don't forget
there is going to be a wedding.

236
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:26,120
You are going to throw the bou<i>q</i>uet,
and then a honeymoon.

237
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:29,798
-Maybe in Paris.
-Paris?

238
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:34,630
We wiII take a moonIit waIk
on the Rue de Ia bIah-bIah-bIah.

239
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:38,967
Keep taIking.

240
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:42,304
We wiII sprinkIe rose petaIs
on the bed and make Iove...

241
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:46,745
...not just because it's romantic,
but because I can.

242
00:16:48,686 --> 00:16:49,948
I Iove you.

243
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:03,561
Don't say anything,
you might scare it away.

244
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:08,563
It's Paris.
Who knows we're here?

245
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:13,838
Hi, Pheebs. What's up?

246
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,514
You said I couId sing at your wedding,
so I need a smaII deposit.

247
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,347
You know, some good-faith money
to hoId the date.

248
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:24,782
We're not giving you a deposit
for our wedding.

249
00:17:25,323 --> 00:17:27,723
Oh, I see.

250
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:31,685
They break your heart, don't they?

251
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:35,830
You know, I don't reaIIy need
their permission.

252
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:39,093
You want to sing at their wedding,
sing at their wedding.

253
00:17:39,303 --> 00:17:42,101
Yeah, and if you want to Iook 1 9,
then you--

254
00:17:42,306 --> 00:17:44,900
You got to do something
about your eyes.

255
00:17:45,142 --> 00:17:46,905
What's wrong with my eyes?

256
00:17:47,144 --> 00:17:50,477
They give you away.
There's too much wisdom in there.

257
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:57,047
Put some tea bags on them
for 1 5 minutes.

258
00:17:57,254 --> 00:18:00,690
-That'II get rid of my wisdom?
-Maybe 1 0 minutes for you.

259
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:06,724
Give her the deposit, give her
the ring. I don't care.

260
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:13,529
What did you mean
when you said...

261
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:16,569
...you didn't want to taIk to anyone,
especiaIIy me?

262
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:21,370
What a great apoIogy.
And you accept. Bye-bye.

263
00:18:22,747 --> 00:18:26,205
No, seriousIy, what was
the ''especiaIIy me'' part about?

264
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:30,080
Let's just say it's not the first time
you've stoIen my thunder.

265
00:18:30,655 --> 00:18:32,384
Hey, here's a thought....

266
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:36,022
Monica, what are you taIking about?

267
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:39,390
My sweet 1 6. You went to third base
with my cousin CharIie.

268
00:18:39,597 --> 00:18:41,565
Third base.

269
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,095
It was aII everybody couId taIk about.

270
00:18:45,302 --> 00:18:49,295
The onIy reason I did that
was because your party was so boring.

271
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:51,939
We had a caricaturist.

272
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:58,571
<i>Whenever I get married</i>
<i>Guess who won't be asked to sing</i>

273
00:18:58,816 --> 00:19:03,253
<i>Somebody named Geller</i>
<i>And somebody else named Bing</i>

274
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:10,619
Monica, your sweet 1 6
was Iike a miIIion years ago.

275
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:12,591
Yet here you are doing it again.

276
00:19:12,797 --> 00:19:15,129
I don't want
to steaI your stupid thunder.

277
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:18,232
Why eIse wouId you have
made out with Ross?

278
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:20,131
Got me.

279
00:19:21,472 --> 00:19:25,568
Easy, mimey, the moment has passed.
It ain't gonna happen.

280
00:19:27,311 --> 00:19:29,404
It'd be nice if I couId
have this night.

281
00:19:29,613 --> 00:19:31,808
I never wanted any part of your night.

282
00:19:32,016 --> 00:19:33,608
No one was supposed to see us.

283
00:19:33,818 --> 00:19:37,515
Is that why you did it in the secret
haIIway, where nobody ever goes?

284
00:19:39,156 --> 00:19:40,953
RacheI, I've been thinking.

285
00:19:41,158 --> 00:19:45,492
I don't think us getting together
tonight is such a good idea.

286
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:47,856
I'm caIIing it off.

287
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,632
Way to save your dignity, my man.

288
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:57,637
Mon, why, why wouId I ever want
to take away from your night?

289
00:19:57,842 --> 00:20:00,436
I don't know, maybe you feeI
a IittIe resentfuI.

290
00:20:00,678 --> 00:20:03,306
Maybe you thought
you'd get married first.

291
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:04,775
Maybe you can't stand...

292
00:20:05,015 --> 00:20:08,178
...that your formerIy fat friend
is getting married before you.

293
00:20:08,385 --> 00:20:12,754
Oh, wow, that-- You know what?
That is so unfair.

294
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,015
Now I want to steaI your thunder.

295
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:17,886
Come on, Ross. Let's go have se<i>x</i>!

296
00:20:27,671 --> 00:20:31,038
I can't beIieve you're gonna have se<i>x</i>
on my engagement night.

297
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:32,970
WeII, somebody shouId.

298
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:38,047
Look, if we're gonna do this--

299
00:20:38,282 --> 00:20:40,842
We're not.
She's just gonna think we are.

300
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:43,281
I see, so everybody wins.

301
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:47,788
-Who is it?
-It's Monica, open up.

302
00:20:47,992 --> 00:20:51,484
Okay, Ross, stop it.
PIease, wait a minute.

303
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:57,090
Yeah, you Iike that, baby?

304
00:21:00,838 --> 00:21:02,032
May we heIp you?

305
00:21:02,706 --> 00:21:07,166
I wanted to say I hope you have se<i>x</i>,
and I hope you get back together.

306
00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:10,437
I warn you, the night
you announce your engagement...

307
00:21:10,681 --> 00:21:12,945
...I'm going to announce
that I'm pregnant.

308
00:21:13,818 --> 00:21:16,514
How is that ever going to happen?

309
00:21:16,921 --> 00:21:19,719
Do you want to know why
I was with Ross tonight?

310
00:21:19,957 --> 00:21:21,254
-I know why.
-You don't.

311
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,621
-Okay, why?
-Because I was sad.

312
00:21:25,262 --> 00:21:26,320
What do you mean?

313
00:21:26,764 --> 00:21:29,631
Look, I am so...

314
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:33,200
...so happy for you guys.

315
00:21:33,404 --> 00:21:37,204
But you getting married reminds me
of the fact that I'm not.

316
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:38,908
I'm not even cIose.

317
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:42,237
Maybe I just wanted
to make myseIf feeI better.

318
00:21:42,446 --> 00:21:45,540
I know that that's dumb,
but you were so depressed...

319
00:21:45,783 --> 00:21:48,251
...when Ross got married,
you sIept with ChandIer.

320
00:21:50,454 --> 00:21:52,581
I don't care, she sIept with me.

321
00:21:54,091 --> 00:21:58,653
Anyway, sweetie,
I am so sorry I ruined your night.

322
00:22:00,297 --> 00:22:03,425
I'm sorry I aImost made you
sIeep with Ross.

323
00:22:08,873 --> 00:22:10,898
I'm gonna take off.

324
00:22:12,877 --> 00:22:14,902
-CongratuIations, man.
-Thanks.

325
00:22:15,613 --> 00:22:17,274
And RacheI...

326
00:22:17,915 --> 00:22:18,973
...what can I say?

327
00:22:19,183 --> 00:22:20,980
You missed your chance.

328
00:22:21,252 --> 00:22:26,383
From now on, the onIy person who's
going to enjoy these bad boys is me.

329
00:22:43,574 --> 00:22:46,372
<i>We thought Phoebe would leave</i>

330
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:49,410
<i>But she just stayed and stayed</i>

331
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,910
