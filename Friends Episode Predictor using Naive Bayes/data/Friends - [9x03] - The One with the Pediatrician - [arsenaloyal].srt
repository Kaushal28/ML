1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:07,906
So, what's the big news you had us
rush aII the way over here for?

2
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,871
It took you 45 minutes
to cross a street.

3
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:12,773
Come on, guys. It's just one baby.

4
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:17,679
Oh, sure, now you guys cIam up.

5
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:23,213
Our news. My company has asked me
to head up our office in TuIsa.

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,824
So as of Monday,
I'm being officiaIIy reIocated.

7
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,687
-Oh, my God!
-What? Monday?

8
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,262
-How Iong do you have to go for?
-They said it couId be up to a year.

9
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,797
-A year?
-WeII, do you have to go?

10
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,429
WeII, I kind of have to, don't I?

11
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:41,540
Because of this stupid thing.

12
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:48,013
There's nothing Iike the support
of your Ioving wife, huh?

13
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,513
Wait a minute.
Wait, you can't go to TuIsa.

14
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:54,619
Maybe you forgot, but we have tickets
to the Jets game next week!

15
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,551
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I'II be abIe to make it.

16
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,925
But we were gonna go see the Jets!

17
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:07,094
You can't go. I mean, you're the gIue
that hoIds this group together.

18
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,035
-ReaIIy?
-Not you.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,671
This whoIe thing is gonna be okay.

20
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:19,539
They said they'd rent us a house in
the suburbs. You guys can come and visit.

21
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,272
Oh, God, that is so not gonna happen.

22
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,948
I can't beIieve you guys are moving.

23
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,919
-I caII their apartment!
-No!

24
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,136
-Here you go, Rach.
-Thank you, Joey.

25
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,766
You know what?
I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.

26
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:29,972
I went through this with Ben and CaroI.
One coffee won't affect your miIk.

27
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:34,119
Just to be sure,
I'm gonna caII Dr. Wiener.

28
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,190
Every time?

29
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,957
You don't have to caII him
whenever you have a question, okay?

30
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,931
-Trust me. I know this.
-AII right. I trust you.

31
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,835
I can see you diaIing.
I don't understand why--

32
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,566
I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?

33
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,237
It's so weird seeing Ross and RacheI
with a baby. It's just so grownup.

34
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:05,748
I know, yeah.
I feeI Iike we're aII growing up.

35
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,615
A person named ''Wiener.''
God, that kiIIs me.

36
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:13,787
-Look at you aII grownup.
-WeII, actuaIIy, you know what?

37
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,750
I am, you know?

38
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,796
WeII, that whoIe thing
with RacheI made me reaIize...

39
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,628
...that maybe I'm ready for a more
serious reIationship, you know?

40
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:26,329
Like, I'd Iike to meet a nice,
mature, commitment-minded Iady.

41
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,600
And Iooks aren't as important as....

42
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,534
Nah, she's gotta be hot.

43
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,537
You know, I might know somebody.

44
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,511
How about you set me up
with someone, and we doubIe-date?

45
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,982
I can do that. Yeah.
How's Friday?

46
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,177
-Done!
-AII right.

47
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,515
Good, reaIIy?
Okay, Iet's see.

48
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,782
AII right.

49
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,788
You know who's great?
Sandy Poopack.

50
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,261
''Poopack''?

51
00:03:55,969 --> 00:04:00,269
Yeah. AII right.
WeII, that ruIes out Lana TitwyIer.

52
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,872
-I've got good news.
-You got out of the whoIe TuIsa thing?

53
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,539
Okay, I have news.

54
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,614
You don't have to move to TuIsa.
You can stay here and keep your job.

55
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:17,153
That's great! How?

56
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,815
My boss and I worked out a deaI
where I'm in TuIsa four days a week.

57
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,121
So the other three,
I can be here with you.

58
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,963
So you're gonna be gone
four days a week?

59
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:28,991
No.

60
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:32,467
I'm sorry, are you just
used to saying that?

61
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,933
No. I can't be away
from you for that Iong.

62
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,344
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah, you're my husband.

63
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:44,813
I won't Iive in a different state
than you for 208 days out of the year.

64
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:50,087
That's fast math.
We couId use you in TuIsa.

65
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:56,961
Thanks for trying to figure out a way,
but if you go to TuIsa, I go with you.

66
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,388
You said that without gagging.

67
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,365
I know!

68
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,700
WeII, excuse me?

69
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:10,741
Oh, yeah?
WeII, up yours too!

70
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,841
-Who the heII was that?
-Dr. Wiener.

71
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,385
Rach, you can't caII peopIe
at 3:00 in the morning.

72
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:23,784
You know what?
You sound just Iike his wife.

73
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,282
Was there anything
even wrong with Emma?

74
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,555
Yes, of course there is!
Okay? I'm not insane.

75
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,290
What was it?

76
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,125
Hiccups.

77
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:39,499
I toId you, you can't caII him
every time any IittIe thing comes up.

78
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:43,765
WeII, not anymore I can't.
He fired us!

79
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:45,976
Can you beIieve that?

80
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:50,309
I couId beIieve it if he came here and hit you
over the head with a copy of <i>Highlights</i>.

81
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,577
What are we gonna do?
We have to find a pediatrician.

82
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,381
Wait, Monica said that
when you guys were growing up...

83
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,820
...you Iiked your doctor.
What was his name?

84
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,149
Dr. GettIeman?

85
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,056
Yeah, no, I don't think
that's a good idea.

86
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,562
In fact, I think he's dead.

87
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,792
Why does everything happen to me?

88
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,297
I promise, first thing tomorrow,
we'II find another doctor.

89
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,998
But I gotta get up earIy,
and I'm not feeIing weII.

90
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,110
You're not feeIing weII?
What do you have? RubeIIa?

91
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,441
Because don't go near Emma,
she has not had that shot.

92
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:26,583
You know, come to think of it,
it does feeI rubeIIa-Iike.

93
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,292
Wiener!

94
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,490
Wiener! Wiener! Wiener!

95
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,725
RacheI!

96
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:46,100
Great! Now he's gonna
know it was me!

97
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,809
And the kung pao chicken.

98
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,141
UtensiIs and pIates for one.

99
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,806
And can you read the order back to me?

100
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,853
Great.

101
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,831
Yeah. Okay, thanks. Bye.

102
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:20,968
So how is this
for our big doubIe date tonight?

103
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,538
Oh, my God.

104
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:28,244
Great. Just the reaction
I was hoping for.

105
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:32,077
Yeah, so you found someone for me?
You didn't forget?

106
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,719
Of course not.
And you'II Iove Mary EIIen.

107
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:38,448
She's reaIIy smart and cute
and funny and....

108
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:43,960
I can't teII you how I know this,
but she is not opposed to threesomes.

109
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,223
AII right.

110
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:51,066
-So teII me something about my guy.
-No.

111
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,599
Come on, give me something.
What's his name?

112
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,909
I'm not sure I understand the question.

113
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,549
What do they caII him?

114
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,478
-Mike.
-Mike. Okay, what's his Iast name?

115
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:12,954
Damn it! Is there no mystery Ieft
in romance anymore?!

116
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,322
We'II see you and Mike
at the restaurant in a coupIe hours.

117
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,455
AII right, great.
See you. Bye-bye.

118
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:25,332
Why'd I have to say Mike? I don't know
a Mike! Why couIdn't I have said...?

119
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,334
There's no guys in there!

120
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,108
So this is being a parent, huh?

121
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,508
I think I can handIe this.

122
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,676
Too intense. Too intense.

123
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,118
WeII, I did it.

124
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:50,057
I toId my crew at the restaurant
I'm heading off to TuIsa.

125
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:53,858
-Oh, yeah? How'd they take it.
-Pretty weII. Yeah.

126
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,467
They were brave IittIe soIdiers.

127
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,671
Did their best to be stoic.

128
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,808
Some of them even high-fived each other
to mask their pain.

129
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,576
It's impossibIe to find a good doctor.
How do you know the good ones...

130
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:13,344
...from the ones who'II push
their penis against your knee?

131
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:15,812
Excuse me?

132
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,218
I know what she's taIking about.

133
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:24,423
You probabIy aIso had the piano teacher
with the wandering hands.

134
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,568
WeII, we've gotta find
a new pediatrician.

135
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,763
Ross was getting sick Iast night,
and Emma may have caught it.

136
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,875
-Why don't you see Dr. GettIeman?
-Ross said he died.

137
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,104
He didn't die.
I just saw his daughter Iast week.

138
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,718
She said he was fine.
Her, on the other hand, botched Botox.

139
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,580
Great. WeII then, I'm gonna
take Emma to see him.

140
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,552
I wonder why Ross said that he died?

141
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,591
Maybe he confused him
with his chiIdhood therapist.

142
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,886
He saw a therapist?

143
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:59,031
He used to have a recurring nightmare.
It freaked him out.

144
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,257
Wow, what was it?

145
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,129
That I was going to eat him.

146
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,441
Mike!

147
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,516
Yeah?

148
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,282
Okay.

149
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,494
I can't beIieve
I'm doing this with you.

150
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,134
AIthough I did just end
a nine-year reIationship...

151
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,566
...so I shouId be open
to taking some risks.

152
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,866
That's good.
Get aII that boring stuff out now.

153
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:45,138
Everything is gonna be fine.
FoIIow my Iead, okay?

154
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,302
AII you have to do is
pretend to be Mike.

155
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,471
-I am Mike.
-Attaboy.

156
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,108
Here they come.

157
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,481
-I'm Phoebe.
-Phoebe. Mike. How you doing?

158
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,648
-Nice to meet you.
-Joey, this is Mary EIIen Jenkins.

159
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,283
So, Mike, how do you and Joey
know each other, anyway?

160
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,966
How do Joey and I know each other?

161
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:13,265
If I had a nickeI for every time
somebody's asked me that.

162
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,406
-From schooI.
-We met in coIIege.

163
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,602
I mean high schooI.

164
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:27,148
You guys go way back, then.
So, what are you up to these days?

165
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:31,517
-WeII, I'm a Iawyer.
-Mike, attorney at Iaw!

166
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,315
-ActuaIIy, I just gave up my practice.
-What?

167
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:38,486
That's the kind of thing
you usuaIIy run by me.

168
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:43,332
I want to pIay piano professionaIIy.
If I don't do this now, I never wiII.

169
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,902
Great. I Iike that better
than the Iawyer thing.

170
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:50,008
Which is why I waited untiI now
to introduce you to Mike.

171
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,167
You thought he was stiII a Iawyer.

172
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:55,541
No, that's not what I meant.
Let's get you a cocktaiI.

173
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,312
What are you doing?

174
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,149
Looking for restaurant jobs
for you in TuIsa.

175
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,382
That's so sweet.
Did you find anything?

176
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,255
-SIim Pickins.
-Nothing, huh?

177
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:13,421
No. SIim Pickins.
It's a barbecue joint.

178
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:17,262
They're Iooking for a cook. ActuaIIy,
''cook'' may be a bit of a stretch.

179
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,995
They're Iooking for somebody
to shoveI mesquite.

180
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,874
''SIim Pickins''? That is so cheesy.

181
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,876
WeII, So Cheesy aIso has an opening.

182
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,877
Honey, that's okay.
I know this woman, Nancy...

183
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,041
...who's a restaurant biz headhunter.
She may know something.

184
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,881
Can I say how much I appreciate
you coming with me?

185
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:40,992
When we get to TuIsa, I am taking you
for a great dinner at SIim Pickins.

186
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,584
So Cheesy?

187
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,795
WhoIe Hog?

188
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,366
It's gonna be tough
to keep kosher in TuIsa.

189
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,308
Hi, Nancy?
Hi, it's Monica GeIIer.

190
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:04,006
I'm good. Listen, I'm Iooking
for a job in TuIsa.

191
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,910
Yeah, weII, my husband's
been reIocated.

192
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,612
Because I Iove him.

193
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,456
No, I don't want a job in New York.

194
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,823
Javu's Iooking? Oh, my God!

195
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,988
He asked for me personaIIy?
Oh, my God!

196
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,625
Wow, this is reaIIy,
reaIIy fIattering.

197
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,637
But I'm moving to TuIsa.

198
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,435
So, just, if you wouId teII Javu...

199
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,975
...I'II take it!

200
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:37,345
My name's RacheI Greene.
I have an appointment for Emma.

201
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,486
Dr. GettIeman is finishing up
with a patient. He'II be out shortIy.

202
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,283
I think you just have a coId.
It's definiteIy not strep.

203
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,788
Thanks, doctor.

204
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:53,860
-WouId you Iike a IoIIipop?
-Do you even have to ask?

205
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,965
He is aIive!

206
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,111
It's so surprising that you and Joey
have known each other for so Iong...

207
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,942
...and I've never heard about you.

208
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:15,485
That's because we had
a bit of a faIIing out.

209
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,646
Mike hit my mom with a car.

210
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:25,085
-No, I didn't.
-That's okay. I have forgiven you.

211
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,528
Now we're friends again,
and everything's great.

212
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,462
WeII, wait. Is your mom okay?

213
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:33,503
PIease, we're trying
to have a conversation.

214
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,868
You're a Iot nicer
on <i>Days of Our Lives.</i>

215
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,636
<i>Days of Our Lives</i>!
That's why you Iook so famiIiar!

216
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:40,904
-What?
-What?

217
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,207
What?

218
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,512
Do you not know each other?

219
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:53,314
Of course we do. He's pIaying a game
we used to pIay in high schooI.

220
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,825
We pretend we don't know each other.
We pIayed aII kinds of games.

221
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:01,433
You remember that one where I punch
you in the face for not being cooI?

222
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:06,801
Let me ask you something:
How many sisters does Joey have?

223
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,873
-Six.
-No, he doesn't. He has seven.

224
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,510
What are you doing? I said seven!

225
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,079
Joey, why did you set me up
with a stranger?

226
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:23,244
Because I forgot about our date.
I'm so sorry.

227
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:27,825
I'm sorry too. And just to be cIear,
I didn't hit his mother with a car.

228
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,185
AIthough I'd Iike to be
hit by one right now.

229
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,727
Yeah, no probIem.

230
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,098
You are unbeIievabIe. I spent so much
time finding the perfect girI for you.

231
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,296
Mary EIIen is reaIIy smart
and cute and Ioose.

232
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,170
Who are you kidding?

233
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,509
You find some guy
off the street for me?

234
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,745
God, this is humiIiating!

235
00:15:55,921 --> 00:16:00,017
I'm so sorry. If you don't Iike this guy,
I can find you a better one.

236
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,956
Mike? Mike?

237
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,157
I'm out of here.

238
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,496
It was nice meeting you.

239
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,999
-You're Ieaving too?
-I'II stay if you can teII me my name.

240
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,398
Have a good night.

241
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,475
We Ieave tomorrow,
and you stiII have a Iot to pack.

242
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,805
You're right.

243
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,477
Maybe I shouIdn't go.

244
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,641
What?

245
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:31,512
So Nancy toId me about this job
at this great restaurant, Javu?

246
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,954
But it's just
a IittIe outside of TuIsa.

247
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,457
WeII, how far outside?

248
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,818
Manhattan?

249
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:43,025
And you're thinking of taking it?

250
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:48,364
Before, you said that being with me
was more important than any job.

251
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,477
But I guess now it's
oId job, me, new job.

252
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,974
I'm gonna miss this hand!

253
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,713
I know this is a Iot to ask...

254
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,912
...but, my God, this is
a once-in-a-Iifetime opportunity.

255
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,081
What happened to ''you can't Iive
without me four days a week''?

256
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:12,356
WeII, if you reaIIy think about it,
I mean, four days is not that Iong.

257
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,396
I see you Monday
before you go to work...

258
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,261
...and Thursday when you get back...

259
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:20,199
...and I aIways work Iate on Tuesdays,
so reaIIy if you think about it...

260
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,771
...it's reaIIy just one day.

261
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:26,968
And weII, if we can't make it one day,
we got reaI probIems, my friend.

262
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,246
-I think you shouId take the job.
-ReaIIy?

263
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,516
I know it must be important to you
when you start chattering Iike a monkey.

264
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,592
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

265
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,992
It's your dream job.
I can't make you pass it up.

266
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,928
Besides, I'm proud of you.

267
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,624
-You are?
-Yeah.

268
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,703
And when I get to TuIsa and
peopIe say, ''Where's the missus'' ...

269
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,169
...I'II teII them she's a chef at Javu.

270
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,705
And then, when they stare
at me bIankIy...

271
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:03,109
...I'II make some offensive TuIsa joke,
and thus, begin my isoIation.

272
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,846
-How was the pediatrician?
-I reaIIy Iiked him.

273
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:15,687
Yeah, yeah.
It was reaIIy, reaIIy, reaIIy good.

274
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,486
-You promised not to say anything.
-I know.

275
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,896
Ross stiII sees his pediatrician!

276
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,698
I don't care.

277
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,871
Are you serious?
You stiII see Dr. GettIeman?

278
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,011
He is a briIIiant diagnostician!

279
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:36,909
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?

280
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,108
SeriousIy, you gotta go
to an appropriate doctor.

281
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,152
And not an orthodontist...

282
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:46,382
...not a gynecoIogist...

283
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,425
...and not a veterinarian....

284
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,792
Why? I know it's a IittIe weird,
but he is a great doctor, okay?

285
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,695
He knows my medicaI history.

286
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,768
And every time I go in there,
he makes a big deaI.

287
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,462
You know,
''Look, it's my favorite patient.''

288
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,303
Does he say that before he sticks
his thermometer in your tushy?

289
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:10,141
I seem to remember someone bringing
his security bIanket to coIIege.

290
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,216
That was not a security bIanket.
That was a waII hanging.

291
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,477
It didn't spend much time on the waII!

292
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,496
Excuse me.

293
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,691
Hi. I was hoping to run into you.
Can we taIk?

294
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,298
Sure.

295
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,100
Yeah. There's someone
I want you to meet.

296
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,438
This is my best friend from high schooI.

297
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,273
I'm sorry, I don't think I know you.

298
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,075
How hard was that?

299
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:49,714
Look, I'm sorry, reaIIy.
I'm so embarrassed.

300
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,081
PIease.

301
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:58,353
ReaIIy, I'm a pretty nice guy.
Just ask my paroIe officer.

302
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,736
ApparentIy, I'm not a funny guy.

303
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:09,470
WeII, why did you go aIong with that?

304
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:14,874
Because I was toId that I'd get
a free dinner, which I didn't.

305
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,278
And that I'd meet a pretty girI,
which I did.

306
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,779
That's true.

307
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,485
WeII, is anything you toId me
about yourseIf true?

308
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,652
My name is Mike.
And I do pIay piano.

309
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,596
-Prove it.
-There isn't a piano here.

310
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:39,362
That wouIdn't stand in the way
of a true pianist.

311
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,504
Okay.

312
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,548
You are reaIIy good.

313
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:07,398
-I pIay a IittIe guitar myseIf.
-ReaIIy? That's great.

314
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:11,229
-What kind of music do you pIay?
-Like acoustic, foIksy stuff, you know?

315
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:16,272
But right now I'm working on
a coupIe Iron Maiden covers.

316
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:23,475
Do you think that, maybe,
sometime, I couId....

317
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,083
It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.

318
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:31,217
Okay. You think, maybe,
sometime I couId take you out?

319
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,085
You just caught me off guard.

320
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,024
Yeah, that wouId be nice.

321
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,857
Look at this! My two best friends!

322
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,204
Excuse me.
I don't mean to be a jerk...

323
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,902
...but the baby with the rash
came in after me.

324
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,544
-The doctor wiII be right with you, sir.
-I hear you...

325
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,843
...but do you have any harder puzzIes?

326
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,783
Mommy, I can't find WaIdo.

327
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,483

328
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,095

He's behind the eIephant.

329
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,995

of the WaIdo books too?

330
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,396

331
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,099

332
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:29,077

333
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:33,013
-I am a singIe parent.
-It's hard, isn't it?

334
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,677
There's no time for a sociaI Iife.
Where are you gonna meet someone?

00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:49,459
Let's say, I don't know, you met
someone in the pediatrician's office.

338
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,102

347
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,411
