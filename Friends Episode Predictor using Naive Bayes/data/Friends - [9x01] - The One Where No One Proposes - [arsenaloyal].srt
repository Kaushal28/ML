1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,308
Joey?

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,903
Oh, my God.

3
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,576
Okay.

4
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,687
So...

5
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,562
...I guess we shouId
make it officiaI, huh?

6
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,335
Look, Rach, I....

7
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:40,967
Hey, Ross is here!
Hey, Iook, it's my good friend Ross!

8
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:44,041
-Hey, Ross.
-Hey, Joey.

9
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,169
-Hey, you.
-Hey, you.

10
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:52,841
And he brought fIowers! Thanks, Ross.
I'm reaIIy more of a candy kind of guy.

11
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:55,913
You're weird today.

12
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,682
Listen, I wanted to taIk to you
about something.

13
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:05,592
Yeah. ActuaIIy, I kind of need
to taIk to you too.

14
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,597
-Joey, couId you give us a minute?
-No.

15
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,568
-What?
-I'm sorry. I meant, ''No.''

16
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,875
Hi. Hey, Iook who's here.

17
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,042
Where's my granddaughter?
I've been practicing my magic tricks.

18
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,045
He puIIed a quarter out of my ear.

19
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,612
-Hey, where's Mom?
-She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.

20
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,516
Aunt Liddy's coming?
That means we get $5 each!

21
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:37,457
So when do I get to meet Emma
and show her this:

22
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,027
Okay, wow.

23
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,128
Emma's in the nursery.
I'II take you now if you want.

24
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,831
-But I reaIIy want to taIk to you.
-I know. I stiII need to taIk to you.

25
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,407
But before you guys do that,
I need to taIk to you.

26
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:53,510
And Ross, I need to taIk to you.

27
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,045
-And I need to taIk to you.
-About what?

28
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,911
To see if you know
what these guys are taIking about.

29
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,894
Isn't she beautifuI?

30
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,702
Look at her, my first grandchiId.

31
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,674
What about Ben?

32
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:02,441
WeII, of course, Ben.
I meant my first granddaughter.

33
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,589
God, isn't she beautifuI?
Doesn't she Iook just Iike RacheI?

34
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:15,888
I know everybody keeps saying that,
but aII I see is Vin DieseI.

35
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,032
What do you think
our baby wiII Iook Iike?

36
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,499
Oh, God. PIease. You.

37
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,904
But it'II have my sense of humor.

38
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,882
Have you thought any more
about you and RacheI?

39
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,383
Yeah, actuaIIy I was gonna taIk to her
when you guys came in the room.

40
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:44,887
That's so exciting! Wow.
You couId've done that with us there.

41
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,055
-Yeah, right.
-Sure. Okay.

42
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,561
You can touch yourseIf in front of us,
but you can't taIk to RacheI.

43
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,223
What? When have I ever
touched myseIf in front of you guys?

44
00:03:55,401 --> 00:04:00,964
Oh, pIease. Just before,
when you were asIeep in the Iounge.

45
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:04,234
That Armenian famiIy was watching you
instead of the TV.

46
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:11,213
That reminds me. That Mr. Hazmegian
stiII has my Game Boy.

47
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,045
-ChandIer, can I taIk to you for a second?
-Sure.

48
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,452
Dude, I just did something terribIe.

49
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,324
That was you? I thought it was Jack.

50
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:26,327
No, no. That was Jack.
RacheI thinks I asked her to marry me.

51
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:31,196
-What? Why does she think that?
-Because it kind of Iooked Iike I did.

52
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,404
Again, what?

53
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,806
Okay, I was down on one knee
with the ring in my hand--

54
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,501
As we aII are at some point
during the day.

55
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,312
It wasn't my ring.
It feII out of Ross' jacket...

56
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,611
...and when I kneIt down to pick it up,
RacheI thought I was proposing.

57
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,912
Ross had a ring?
And he was gonna propose?

58
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,250
-I guess.
-And you did it first?

59
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,622
This is gonna kiII him. You know
how much he Ioves to propose.

60
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,454
I know. I know. It's awfuI.

61
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,031
WeII, what did she say?

62
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,929
She said, ''Yes.''

63
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,662
You're smiIing.

64
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,602
No, I'm not.

65
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,344
Yes, you are. I can teII
by the way your mouth is.

66
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,838
Does Ross know?

67
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,984
Oh, my God.
What the heII am I gonna teII him?

68
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,676
-Maybe you don't have to teII him.
-I Iike that. Yeah.

69
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,485
If you cIear things up with RacheI,
Ross never needs to find out.

70
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,559
But you have to do it before
he hears about it and kicks your ass.

71
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,958
AII right, Iet's not get carried away.

72
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,890
I want a baby.

73
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:39,232
Honey, we've been over this.
I need to be facing the other way.

74
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,872
If we have sex again, it'II doubIe
our chances of getting pregnant.

75
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:48,980
-I think that cIoset's stiII avaiIabIe.
-I am so tired.

76
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,516
-Yeah, okay, but no forepIay.
-DeaI!

77
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,719
Dad, seriousIy!

78
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,091
You know, you reaIIy shouId
see someone about that.

79
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,167
Noted.

80
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,197
I wanna go taIk to RacheI for a minute.
Are you gonna be okay aIone for a bit?

81
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,744
Are you kidding me?
I couId stay and Iook at her forever.

82
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,174
ActuaIIy....

83
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,048
-Hey.
-Hi.

84
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,555
Are you aII right?

85
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:38,994
-I think I just got engaged.
-Oh, my God! He did it?

86
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,291
What? Did you know
he was gonna ask me?

87
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:45,870
Are you kidding?
I'm, Iike, the one who taIked him into it.

88
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,804
I Iike to think of myseIf
as the puppet master of the group.

89
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,875
-And you reaIIy think this is a good idea?
-I just taIked him into it.

90
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,777
Don't teII me I have to do you too?

91
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,613
-The puppet master gets tired, peopIe.
-Okay.

92
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,517
I don't know. It just doesn't feeI right.

93
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:08,319
Why? You two are so meant
to be together. Everybody thinks so.

94
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,962
ReaIIy? Even Ross?

95
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:15,100
EspeciaIIy Ross.

96
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:21,633
Hey, Pheebs. You know what?
I'II come back Iater.

97
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,539
Wow. Kind of a fuII house here.

98
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,572
I guess I'II just-- I'II come back.

99
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:37,084
There he goes. Your fiancé.

100
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,552
I guess so.

101
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,255
AIthough he does
pIay with himseIf in his sIeep.

102
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,489
I can't say I'm surprised.

103
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,471
-Dad, what are you doing?
-There are peopIe in there having sex.

104
00:07:56,676 --> 00:08:00,009
It can't be me. I'm standing right here.

105
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,280
-Wanna peek?
-No!

106
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,506
Come on.

107
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,552
You know what?
I don't Iike you without Mom.

108
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,778
Come on.

109
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,323
We're not peeking?

110
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,226
WeII, I'm peeking.

111
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,930
Oh, my God!

112
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:25,328
HeIIo, sir. You know Monica.

113
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,316
-Hey, is it okay to come in?
-Of course.

114
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:47,458
Joey, this ring, I--
It's beautifuI. I Iove it.

115
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:53,198
Yeah. Look, Rach,
there's something I gotta teII you.

116
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,458
-Hey.
-Hi.

117
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:58,866
-Are you ready to try nursing again?
-Yeah. Hi, Emma.

118
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,039
Why do you think
she won't take my breast?

119
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,607
It's aII right.
It takes babies a whiIe to get it.

120
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,438
-But don't worry, it'II happen.
-Okay.

121
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:14,084
Okay, sweetie, you can do it.
Just open up and put it in your mouth.

122
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,384
Dear Lord.

123
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,726
-I'm sorry, honey, what were you saying?
-Yeah, Iook, I think that--

124
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,830
Because, Iook! She's puIIing away again.

125
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,695
Do you think my nippIes
are too big for her mouth?

126
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,099
She Iooks scared.
Doesn't she Iook scared?

127
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,539
You know, I don't reaIIy know her.

128
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,677
Why don't we try massaging
the breast to stimuIate the fIow?

129
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,317
-Okay.
-Are you kidding me?

130
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:49,218
This is so frustrating.
Why doesn't she want my breast?

131
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,823
I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!

132
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,356
-Hey, wait up.
-Hi.

133
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,259
CongratuIations.

134
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,663
I didn't want to say anything in front
of Joey. I didn't know if he knew.

135
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:06,360
What? That we had a baby?
Now Iet's give him a IittIe credit.

136
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,997
AIthough he did eat a piece
of pIastic fruit earIier.

137
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,838
No, no, that you
and RacheI are engaged.

138
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,714
-What?
-Oh, it's a secret?

139
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:21,148
Goody. Yes! We haven't done
the secret thing in a Iong time.

140
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,087
No, RacheI and I are not engaged.

141
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,748
I think you are.

142
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,729
What are you taIking about?
Who toId you that?

143
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,490
RacheI, your betrothed.

144
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:38,894
-We're not engaged.
-Oh, that's right. It's a secret.

145
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:43,098
Right, you are not engaged.
I misunderstood her.

146
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:48,441
Phoebe, there is no secret, okay?
I didn't propose.

147
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:49,706
Are you Iying?

148
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:54,318
Is this Iike that time you tried
to convince us you were a doctor?

149
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,424
I am a doctor!

150
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,153
You know what? I'm just gonna go
and taIk to RacheI myseIf.

151
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,925
AII right. WeII, me too.

152
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,136
-WeII, shouId we wake her up?
-No. No. Come on, Iet her sIeep.

153
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:17,742
-She's so exhausted.
-And so engaged.

154
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:32,385
Oh, my God. She thinks we're engaged!

155
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,361
Why? Why, why wouId
she think we're engaged?

156
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,623
Perhaps because you gave her
an engagement ring?

157
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,495
You know, Ross,
doctors are supposed to be smart.

158
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,197
-I didn't give her that ring.
-You didn't?

159
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,670
-No!
-So whose ring is it?

160
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,143
It's mine.

161
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,146
-Is it an engagement ring?
-Yes.

162
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,143
-But you didn't give it to her?
-No.

163
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,373
-But you were going to propose?
-No!

164
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,348
I might be Iosing interest in this.

165
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:06,222
Look. Look, my mom
gave me that ring...

166
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,417
...because she wanted me
to propose to RacheI.

167
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,824
But aII I wanted to do was see...

168
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:14,830
...if she maybe, kind of wanted
to start things up again.

169
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,592
What beautifuI Iukewarm sentiment.

170
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:22,038
I didn't want to rush into anything.
It seemed Iike she didn't want to either.

171
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,200
But I don't understand
how any of this happened.

172
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:29,313
What, did she find the ring in my jacket,
assume I was gonna propose...

173
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,883
...throw it on
and just start teIIing peopIe?

174
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,986
No, no. She said you
actuaIIy proposed to her.

175
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:41,353
WeII, I didn't! I didn't propose!

176
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,725
UnIess....

177
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,395
Did I?

178
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:56,173
I haven't sIept in 40 hours and....

179
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,574
It does sound
Iike something I wouId do.

180
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,588
Look, we can't stay in here forever.

181
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,093
It's just, I stiII can't beIieve
that my dad saw us having sex.

182
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:19,526
He didn't make it to one
of my piano recitaIs, but this he sees!

183
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,867
This is okay. We're aII aduIts here.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

184
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:27,733
Now, Iet's put our underwear
in our pockets and waIk out the door.

185
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,106
Hi, Dad.

186
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:41,882
-I can stiII caII you that, right?
-Of course. I'II aIways be your dad.

187
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:47,048
I just want you to know that what you
witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.

188
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,392
-It wasn't fun?
-Why, why, why wouId you...?

189
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,492
Look, I just don't want you to think...

190
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,330
...that we're animaIs who do it
whenever we want.

191
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,198
WeII, I don't think that.

192
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:04,206
Before today, I never thought
of you two having sex at aII.

193
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,004
It was a simpIer time.

194
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,643
The truth is, Dad, we're trying.

195
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,875
To kiII you.

196
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,782
Why, why, why wouId you...?

197
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,791
We're trying to have a baby.

198
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,257
-What?
-Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.

199
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,620
Oh, my God, this is so exciting.

200
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,230
WeII, get back in there!
I'II guard the door!

201
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,300
That's okay, Dad,
we can wait untiI Iater.

202
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,596
Whoa! I don't think so.
Aren't you ovuIating?

203
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,038
Daddy!

204
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,799
You gotta get at it, princess.

205
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,103
When your mother and I
were trying to conceive you...

206
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,872
...whenever she was ovuIating,
bam, we did it!

207
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,571
That's how I got my bad hip.

208
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,780
That's funny. This conversation's how
I got the buIIet hoIe in my head.

209
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,583
This one time I had my knee
on the sink, and your mother was--

210
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,386
SeriousIy, sir, my brains,
aII over the waII.

211
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,858
I don't think we need to hear
the specific positions you and Mom had.

212
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,627
You're right.
This is about your positions.

213
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:07,431
Now, what I saw in the cIoset
is not the optimum position...

214
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,733
...for conceiving a chiId.

215
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,640
-AIthough it might feeI good.
-I don't feeI good right now.

216
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,747
But pIeasure is important,
and it heIps if the woman has an orgasm.

217
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,251
You up to the task, saiIor?

218
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,987
Oh, my God....

219
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,065
-Hey.
-Hey. Oh, I need to teII you something.

220
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:43,037
WeII, now's a good time.
I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.

221
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,303
Joey asked me to marry him.

222
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,509
-What?
-Joey proposed to me.

223
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:52,115
-Is he crazy? You just had Ross' baby!
-WeII, I said yes.

224
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,082
What, are you crazy?
You just had Ross' baby!

225
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,556
I'm sensing you won't throw the shower?

226
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:04,526
It's so inappropriate.
No, it is worse than that. It is wrong.

227
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,430
It is bigger than mine!

228
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,961
I know. <i>Days of our Lives,</i>
thank you very much.

229
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,537
-You can't marry him.
-Why not?

230
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:18,199
Come on, I don't want to do this aIone,
and he's such a sweet guy.

231
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:19,867
And he Ioves me so much.

232
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,307
WeII, do you Iove him?

233
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,907
Sure.

234
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:29,779
-Sure?
-Yeah, I mean, whatever.

235
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,989
If you're worried about breaking his heart,
it's stiII broken from the Iast time.

236
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,322
So reaIIy, you're just taking
the aIready broken pieces...

237
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,227
...and breaking them into smaIIer,
more manageabIe pieces.

238
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,097
Okay, forget that.

239
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,999
Honey, the question is...

240
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,867
...do you reaIIy want to marry Joey?

241
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,505
No.

242
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,511
No, I don't.

243
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:01,549
CouId you be a dear and go teII him?

244
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,319
You stiII haven't toId RacheI
you weren't proposing?

245
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,856
No. She had the ring on...

246
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,085
...she seemed so excited,
and then she took her breast out.

247
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:15,495
Joey, you have to teII her what's
going on. And what did it Iook Iike?

248
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,101
I didn't Iook at it.

249
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,601
The stupid baby's head
was bIocking most of it.

250
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,337
Go and teII RacheI right now,
before Ross finds out.

251
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,946
Look, it's not that easy.
She said she wanted to marry me.

252
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,741
I don't want to hurt her.

253
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,448
Okay, Iook, just do it gentIy.

254
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,844
You're right.

255
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:40,014
You're right. I'II go teII her now
before Ross finds out, and I'II be gentIe.

256
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:44,424
I can do that. I am a gentIe person.

257
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:48,965
By the way, two peopIe screwing
in there if you want to check that out.

258
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,868
Hey.

259
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,773
Hey.

260
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,117
Listen, I heard about the engagement.

261
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,886
Surprised?

262
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,854
And confused.

263
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:20,094
Rach, sweetie...

264
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,858
...I didn't propose to you.

265
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,601
I know.

266
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,671
I don't think you do.

267
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,573
You didn't propose to me.

268
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,307
Joey did.

269
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:42,020
Poor baby, you're so tired.

270
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:48,254
Rach, I didn't propose to you.

271
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,396
Joey didn't propose to you.

272
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:56,660
And ChandIer didn't propose to you.

273
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,970
You didn't propose to me.

274
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,234
ChandIer didn't propose to me.

275
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,172
But Joey did.

276
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,340
Joey proposed to you?

277
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,882
-I can come back.
-Wait. Wait. Wait.

278
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,577
-Joey, did you propose to her?
-No.

279
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:21,187
-Yes, you did.
-ActuaIIy, technicaIIy, I didn't.

280
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,862
-WeII, then, why did you give me a ring?
-Wait.

281
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:31,458
-You gave her the ring?
-No, and I did not ask her to marry me.

282
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,035
-Yes, you did.
-No, I didn't.

283
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,433
-Yes, you did.
-No, I didn't.

284
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,541
Yes, you did, and don't
you say you didn't!

285
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,644
He was right there. He got down
on one knee and he proposed.

286
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,178
-You were down on one knee?
-Yeah, that Iooks bad.

287
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:47,910
But I didn't propose.

288
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,816
-Then what did happen?
-Yeah, what did happen?

289
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,117
Okay, the ring feII on the fIoor,
and I went down to pick it up...

290
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,660
...and you thought I was proposing.

291
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,959
Yeah, but you said,
''WiII you marry me?''

292
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,032
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

293
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,569
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did. Oh, my God, you didn't.

294
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,405
-Why didn't you teII me that before?
-WeII, I tried...

295
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:21,019
...but peopIe kept coming in,
and then you took your breast out.

296
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,080
You saw her breast?

297
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:30,388
I'II teII you about it Iater. Be cooI.

298
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,532
Then what the heII were you doing
with an engagement ring?

299
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,327
It wasn't my ring! It's Ross' ring.

300
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:42,166
That's why I feIt so bad, Rach,
because he was gonna propose.

301
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,739
What?!

302
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,906
You were gonna propose to me?

303
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,783
No.

304
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,758
WeII, this is awkward.

305
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:13,735
But I was going to see if, you know,
maybe you wanted to start dating again.

306
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:19,775
-But that, I mean, that was aII, Rach.
-Dude, step up. I proposed.

307
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,742
No, you didn't.

308
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:27,442
That's right. There's a Iot going on here,
and I think I ate some bad fruit earIier.

309
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,149
AII right, so Iet me just get this cIear.

310
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,758
You didn't propose.

311
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,224
You weren't gonna propose.

312
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,863
So this morning,
I didn't have a boyfriend...

313
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,628
...and somehow I got dumped
twice today.

314
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:52,304
Hey, she just woke up. She's hungry.
Why don't we give this another try?

315
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,645
Here we go again.

316
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:59,016
I can't beIieve you toId her
I was gonna propose.

317
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:02,984
-I can't beIieve you're not gonna.
-Hey, I am not gonna rush into anything.

318
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,213
Yeah, dude, I totaIIy understand.

319
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,848
UsuaIIy after I have a baby with
a woman, I Iike to sIow things down!

320
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,627
-Oh, my God!
-What?

321
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,558
She's doing it!
She's breast-feeding!

322
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,099
It's beautifuI.

323
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,793
-I'II come back for her Iater.
-Thank you.

324
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:26,410
-Wow, this feeIs weird.
