1
00:00:02,781 --> 00:00:05,545
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

2
00:00:07,052 --> 00:00:08,178
Say, Rachel...

3
00:00:08,453 --> 00:00:11,479
...I was wondering if you'd like to
go to a movie with me sometime...

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,248
...as my lover.

5
00:00:16,562 --> 00:00:17,654
Too out there.

6
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:20,798
Maybe you'd just like to get
something to eat with me sometime...

7
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:23,496
...as my lover.

8
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:27,261
-Hi.
-Hi.

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,838
All right, let's go shopping.

10
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:32,443
l got a positive balance on my credit card
l want to use before Citibank goes under.

11
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:35,045
Good idea. Good idea.

12
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:38,483
Before we go, you know,
there's something l need to say.

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,448
-Oh, okay.
-Okay.

14
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:46,651
l've kind of had this crush on you.

15
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:50,690
But since you were with Ross,
l didn't do anything about it.

16
00:00:50,862 --> 00:00:54,491
But now that you're not, l'd really
like to ask you out sometime.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,527
So that's what l'm doing...

18
00:00:57,703 --> 00:00:59,603
...now.

19
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:04,374
Wow.

20
00:01:14,987 --> 00:01:16,420
l dropped a cup.

21
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:20,450
The One With the Tiny T-Shirt

22
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:08,136
You know, that's why within
a few years, voice recognition...

23
00:02:08,407 --> 00:02:10,932
...is gonna be pretty much
standard on any computer.

24
00:02:11,109 --> 00:02:15,603
You know, so you could be, like,
''Wash my car.'' ''Clean my room.''

25
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:19,749
lt won't be able to do any of those things,
but it'll understand what you're saying.

26
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:24,355
Wow. Would it be able to recognize
my voice if l talked like this?

27
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,184
Oh, yeah. lt'll understand you,
but it's gonna make fun of you.

28
00:02:30,328 --> 00:02:31,659
Oh, this was so great.

29
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,593
Yeah, it was.

30
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:36,731
All right, then.

31
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:38,935
Bye.

32
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,473
Hello, people who do not live here.

33
00:02:51,683 --> 00:02:54,015
l gave you a key for emergencies.

34
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:56,279
We were out of Doritos.

35
00:02:57,856 --> 00:03:00,586
Hey, how'd the date go
with Mr. Millionaire?

36
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:03,920
Mr. Millionaire.
New, from Snooty Playthings.

37
00:03:04,796 --> 00:03:07,424
Third wife sold separately.

38
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,568
He's great. l mean, we have
such a good time together.

39
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:15,799
He's so funny and so sweet.
And l'm not attracted to him at all!

40
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,005
-Still?
-No.

41
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:21,839
lt's driving me crazy. ln every
other way, he's the perfect guy.

42
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:26,074
He has everything.
Plus, he actually has everything.

43
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:29,848
Life-sized lmperial Stormtroopers
from Sharper lmage?

44
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:31,522
Two.

45
00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:34,289
Wow. Can Joey and l put
them on and fight?

46
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:40,824
Oh, Mommy! Oh, Daddy!
I am a big old baddy

47
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:45,493
Oh, Mommy! Oh, Daddy!
I am a big old baddy

48
00:03:49,374 --> 00:03:52,571
l guess he must've gotten
the part in that play.

49
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:57,511
Either that, or Gloria Estefan was right.
Eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.

50
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:06,219
-Joe, how's it going?
-Good.

51
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:12,319
-Hey.
-Hi.

52
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:14,759
So you're playing Adrienne?

53
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:17,493
Yes. Are you one
of the retarded cousins?

54
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,265
No. l'm playing your husband, Victor.
l'm Joey Tribbiani.

55
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:25,874
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Kate Miller.

56
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:35,312
So the play's pretty great, huh?

57
00:04:35,487 --> 00:04:37,955
Oh, yeah.
l love Jennifer Banberry's work.

58
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:39,750
She's so incisive when it comes...

59
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:42,359
...to deconstructing
the psyche of the middle class.

60
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:44,825
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!

61
00:04:50,435 --> 00:04:51,766
Where do l know you from?

62
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:56,405
Dr. Drake Ramoray?

63
00:04:57,108 --> 00:04:58,541
Days of Our Lives?

64
00:04:58,977 --> 00:05:01,775
Voted most datable neurosurgeon
by Teen Beat?

65
00:05:03,014 --> 00:05:04,038
No, that's not it.

66
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:07,582
So you're a soap actor.

67
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:11,050
Well, this must be exciting for you,
being in a real play.

68
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:14,056
Hey, l've done plays before.
l'm a serious actor.

69
00:05:15,393 --> 00:05:16,587
That infomercial!

70
00:05:18,396 --> 00:05:20,762
For the milk-carton-spout thing!

71
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:23,627
You're the guy who doesn't
know how to pour milk!

72
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,402
See, l actually can pour milk.
But l got you believing that l couldn't.

73
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:31,269
Now, see, that's acting.

74
00:05:31,943 --> 00:05:33,843
Right. At the end,
you choked on a cookie.

75
00:05:34,946 --> 00:05:36,072
Yeah, that was real.

76
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,686
-l cannot believe Mark asked you out.
-l know.

77
00:05:41,853 --> 00:05:43,650
So, what are you gonna tell him?

78
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:47,883
Well, l told him l would think about it,
but l'm gonna tell him no.

79
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:53,426
l mean, l think l'd say no
to anybody right now.

80
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:59,400
Oh, but it was so strange.
l mean, l'm standing there...

81
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:03,940
...with this charming, cute guy
who's asking me to go out with him...

82
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:07,839
...which l'm allowed to do,
and l felt guilty.

83
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:10,174
Like l'd be cheating
on Ross or something.

84
00:06:10,815 --> 00:06:13,943
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means...

85
00:06:14,152 --> 00:06:18,088
...that you're not over Ross yet,
and you have issues with your father.

86
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:25,829
-l don't have any issues with my father.
-Okay, so it's probably the Ross thing.

87
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:30,067
l hate this woman! l hate her!

88
00:06:30,268 --> 00:06:32,930
She told everyone in the company
about that infomercial...

89
00:06:33,104 --> 00:06:36,096
...and now they all keep asking me
to open their drinks!

90
00:06:36,374 --> 00:06:40,708
Okay, and whenever l can't do it,
they're all, like, laughing at me!

91
00:06:43,548 --> 00:06:45,812
-Hello.
-Hey.

92
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:48,509
So Rachel called.

93
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:50,980
Wants to see me.

94
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,951
Going over in a minute.

95
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:58,721
-Wow. What do you think she wants?
-Maybe the crazy fog has lifted...

96
00:06:58,897 --> 00:07:01,923
...and she realizes that life
without me...

97
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,358
...sucks.

98
00:07:04,436 --> 00:07:08,566
lt's possible. You are very lovable.
l'd miss you if l broke up with you.

99
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:12,371
Just trying to be supportive.

100
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:15,379
Be supportive like a guy.

101
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:18,178
lf l broke up with you, l'd miss you.

102
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:25,217
-Hi.
-Hi.

103
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,556
You wanted to see me?

104
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,657
Yeah.

105
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:37,560
Here's a box of your stuff.

106
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:41,903
-What?
-You know, it's just, like, hats...

107
00:07:42,073 --> 00:07:45,634
...and a shirt and CDs.
Just sort of stuff that you've left here.

108
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,268
What are you doing?
Are you trying to hurt me or something?

109
00:07:49,814 --> 00:07:51,679
No.

110
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,475
Ross, it--

111
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:59,088
lt just seems that, you know,
it's time we, you know, move on.

112
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:00,916
l mean, don't you think?

113
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:04,186
-Yes.
-Yeah.

114
00:08:04,362 --> 00:08:05,920
-Yes, l do.
-Good.

115
00:08:06,097 --> 00:08:08,327
Yeah, l really do.

116
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:11,201
Hey!

117
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:13,428
This was a gift.

118
00:08:13,605 --> 00:08:17,371
Ross, you got that for free
from the museum gift shop.

119
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:19,169
lt's still a gift.

120
00:08:19,444 --> 00:08:22,208
l got it from the gift shop.

121
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:26,081
Okay! All right! Give me the mug!
l'll keep the mug!

122
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:28,651
No! You know what,
don't do me any favors.

123
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,310
ln fact...

124
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:33,753
...where's the rest of my stuff?
Like my....

125
00:08:36,094 --> 00:08:38,392
This book is mine!

126
00:08:40,498 --> 00:08:44,798
And that T-shirt you sleep in?
l'd like that back too. Yes, l do.

127
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:51,133
You know how much l love that T-shirt.
You never even wear that T-shirt.

128
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:54,437
l'm just trying to help you move on.

129
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,404
Oh, you are a petty man.

130
00:08:57,682 --> 00:08:59,775
You are a petty, petty...

131
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:01,450
-Petty...
-...petty, petty...

132
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,084
-...small....
-...small....

133
00:09:07,058 --> 00:09:09,822
You are so just
doing this out of spite.

134
00:09:09,994 --> 00:09:14,556
No. No. No. l'm gonna wear
this all the time! l love this shirt!

135
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:17,431
You have not worn
that T-shirt since you were 1 5!

136
00:09:17,602 --> 00:09:20,298
-lt doesn't even fit you anymore!
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

137
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,305
Oh, okay. Okay!

138
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,286
Now, if you don't mind,
l'm gonna take the rest of my stuff...

139
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:42,017
...and relax...

140
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:44,655
...in my favorite shirt.

141
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:48,795
You have a pleasant evening.

142
00:09:58,443 --> 00:10:00,343
So you're, like, a zillionaire.

143
00:10:02,113 --> 00:10:04,445
And you're our age.
You're our age.

144
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:10,246
You know what? You should buy a state
and then just name it after yourself.

145
00:10:10,655 --> 00:10:12,213
What, like, Pete Dakota?

146
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,587
Yeah, or Mississi-Pete.

147
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:20,522
Oh, l got it. Pete Chicago.

148
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,965
That's not a state, Joe.

149
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:25,898
Oh, and Mississi-Pete is?

150
00:10:28,907 --> 00:10:30,272
l gotta go. So....

151
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:32,375
-l'll see you guys later.
-Okay.

152
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,044
You're our age.

153
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:38,379
So are we on for tomorrow?

154
00:10:38,616 --> 00:10:40,481
Absolutely.

155
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:44,584
Now, get out of here, you!

156
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:53,694
Okay, l'm running out of places
l can touch him.

157
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:55,759
ls something wrong with me?

158
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:58,562
l mean, why am l only attracted
to guys with no future?

159
00:10:58,836 --> 00:11:01,430
Either they're too old,
or they're too young.

160
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:04,769
Or they're a big misogynist
jerk poet like Julio.

161
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:06,877
Who, by the way, l'm still attracted to.

162
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:10,174
And then there's Pete,
who's crazy about me...

163
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:13,283
...and he's absolutely perfect,
and there's, like, zip going on!

164
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:15,851
l mean, does it sound like
something's wrong with me?

165
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,079
Yeah, kind of.

166
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:23,259
Happy? ls that what
l'm supposed to be, Vic?

167
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:24,825
Happy?

168
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:27,657
Well, why don't you tell me
what you're supposed to be?

169
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,764
Because l sure as hell
can't figure it out.

170
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:32,767
l talk to you, and nothing!

171
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:35,701
You look at me, and it's nothing!

172
00:11:38,676 --> 00:11:40,007
Nothing.

173
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,740
Tasty.

174
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,616
l'm really starting to feel like
you guys have a history. lt's nice.

175
00:11:49,787 --> 00:11:52,779
-l have a question about this scene.
-Yes.

176
00:11:52,957 --> 00:11:56,688
Well, l don't understand
why Adrienne's attracted to Victor.

177
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:59,455
Peel the onion.

178
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:01,758
First of all, he's good-looking.

179
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:06,267
l think my character needs
a bit more of a reason than that.

180
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:09,938
Hey, how about this one?
lt says so in the script!

181
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,870
You know, l don't know why
my character likes you either.

182
00:12:16,047 --> 00:12:19,073
l mean, it says in the script
here that you're a bitch.

183
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:22,518
-lt doesn't say that in the script.
-lt does in mine.

184
00:12:25,823 --> 00:12:28,758
l can blow-dry it.
l can put gel on it. lt doesn't matter.

185
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:30,757
l still wind up with this little...

186
00:12:30,928 --> 00:12:35,297
...cowlick-y thing on the middle part
of my head. lt's so annoying.

187
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,832
-Does it bug you?
-You bug me.

188
00:12:51,015 --> 00:12:54,348
ls there any chance
you didn't see that?

189
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,388
Ross, you gotta stop, okay?

190
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:04,426
You can't just stare through
the peephole for three hours.

191
00:13:07,065 --> 00:13:09,625
You're gonna get peep-eye.

192
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:12,793
l knew it. l knew it.
l always knew she liked him.

193
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,302
You know, she'd say no,
but here we are, right?

194
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:17,771
We just broke up, first thing she does!

195
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:21,605
-You didn't just break up.
-Hey, it's been, like, three weeks!

196
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,840
You slept with somebody three hours
after you thought you broke up.

197
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:28,348
l mean, bullets have left guns slower.

198
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:31,716
Here they come! Here they--

199
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:34,786
lf she kisses him good night,
l'll kill myself. l swear.

200
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,018
l can't, l can't watch.

201
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:39,786
Come on.
Date over! Date over!

202
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:43,328
-Here we go. She's going in.
-Okay.

203
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:46,231
She's going in.
Wait! He's going in!

204
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,472
He's going in!

205
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,667
The door's closed! l can't see
anything with the door closed!

206
00:13:53,845 --> 00:13:57,713
And the inventor of the door
rests happily in his grave.

207
00:13:57,882 --> 00:14:00,578
Okay, l have to do something.
l mean, l have to stop it!

208
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:01,946
-Stop what?
-l don't know.

209
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,748
But l have a feeling that
my being there will do it.

210
00:14:06,624 --> 00:14:10,185
Look, this guy is bad news, Chandler.
l can sense he's an operator.

211
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:11,885
Rachel wouldn't date an operator.

212
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:15,157
They only make 20 grand a year
and they have to work nights.

213
00:14:17,702 --> 00:14:20,034
l'll go over and l will
borrow something!

214
00:14:20,438 --> 00:14:23,874
-Juice! l need juice!
-No! You can't!

215
00:14:24,475 --> 00:14:26,909
-They must be stopped!
-l am your friend...

216
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:29,012
...and l am not gonna let you do this!

217
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,910
You are surprisingly strong!

218
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:35,944
-l need juice! People need juice!
-Look, man....

219
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,610
-People need juice!
-Listen to me!

220
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:39,984
Juice. They need....

221
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,194
She's moving on, okay? lf it's not
this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.

222
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:50,232
And unless you're thinking
about subletting my peephole...

223
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:53,666
...you are gonna have to get used
to the fact the relationship is over!

224
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:57,705
Okay, man? lt's over.

225
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:03,308
-Yeah. Okay.
-Okay.

226
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:06,382
lt's just l miss her so much.

227
00:15:07,218 --> 00:15:09,118
l know.

228
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,921
l know.

229
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:19,791
ls it just me, or did ''subletting my
peephole'' sound kind of dirty?

230
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,657
Why do your coffee mugs
have numbers on the bottom?

231
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:27,304
Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.

232
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:31,736
That way if one of them's missing,
she can be like, ''Where's number 27?''

233
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:44,243
-You know what?
-No, and l don't think l'm gonna want to.

234
00:15:45,056 --> 00:15:48,787
-l can't do this.
-Yep. That's what l didn't want to know.

235
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,655
Oh, Mark, l'm just doing this
for the wrong reasons, you know?

236
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,321
l'm just doing it to get back at Ross.

237
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,799
l'm sorry. lt's not very fair to you.

238
00:16:01,072 --> 00:16:02,733
Fair, shmair. You know?

239
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,273
Look, you wanna get back
at Ross, l am here for you.

240
00:16:07,211 --> 00:16:08,644
Really.

241
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:13,876
No. No. l say, l say we get back at him
right here on this couch. Right here!

242
00:16:15,286 --> 00:16:18,050
Oh, God.

243
00:16:19,056 --> 00:16:20,614
l'm sorry about this.

244
00:16:21,993 --> 00:16:23,984
That's okay.

245
00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:28,093
-You sure?
-Yeah.

246
00:16:29,267 --> 00:16:32,703
l can just go home and get back
at him by myself.

247
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,337
--and should become the penicillin
of the 21 st century.

248
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,344
And so today, this hospital
is about to take major steps...

249
00:16:43,514 --> 00:16:46,574
...toward leading that revolution.

250
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:49,982
Hey, can l ask you something?

251
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:54,281
Where are we?

252
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:58,626
Well, with all these doctors
and nurses...

253
00:16:58,796 --> 00:17:00,787
...l'm gonna say midget rodeo.

254
00:17:01,732 --> 00:17:03,256
Just tell me the truth.

255
00:17:04,468 --> 00:17:06,402
Okay.

256
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:11,469
You know, l don't think
l told you this...

257
00:17:11,676 --> 00:17:15,043
...but l just recently got out
of a really serious relationship.

258
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,611
Oh, right.
Wasn't that, like, a year ago?

259
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:21,643
So l did tell you.

260
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:24,010
Well, you know,
that's not really the thing.

261
00:17:24,255 --> 00:17:27,349
The thing is, is that right now
l'm just in a place in my life...

262
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:29,288
...where l just need to focus on me.

263
00:17:29,794 --> 00:17:31,989
-Do you know what l mean?
-Oh, yeah, l know.

264
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:38,600
-l so want to be attracted to you.
-But you're not. Okay. Good.

265
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:40,837
l'm sorry.

266
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:47,603
You know what? Don't be. lt's....
Don't be, because it's not so bad.

267
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:49,236
lt's not?

268
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:51,973
Yeah. l know l'm no Jon Bon Jovi.

269
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:57,183
Or someone you find attractive.

270
00:17:57,822 --> 00:17:59,881
l just think, you know...

271
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:03,786
...that you might end up
feeling differently.

272
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,064
Look, l don't want this
to come out wrong...

273
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:14,362
...but you seem awfully confident for
a guy l just told l wasn't attracted to.

274
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:17,405
Yeah, stupidly charming, isn't it?

275
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:20,800
Listen, let's....
You wanna get something to eat?

276
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:23,378
'Cause this place is kind of depressing.

277
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:29,442
Now the man who made all this
possible, Mr. Peter Becker.

278
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,854
One second.

279
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:43,599
l don't think this town is big enough
for the both of us to relax in.

280
00:18:46,737 --> 00:18:48,329
Draw!

281
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:53,505
l wasn't doing anything.

282
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:02,478
Uh-oh. What did she do now?

283
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:05,645
Just because she went to Yale Drama,
she thinks she's, like...

284
00:19:05,823 --> 00:19:10,522
...the greatest actress
since, since sliced bread.

285
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:14,126
Sliced bread.
A wonderful Lady Macbeth.

286
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,496
Oh, God. l just.... l hate her. l hate her
with her ''Oh, l'm so talented'' ...

287
00:19:18,736 --> 00:19:22,672
...and ''Oh, l'm so pretty,''
and ''Oh, l smell so good.''

288
00:19:23,674 --> 00:19:26,040
l think somebody has
a crush on somebody.

289
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,271
Hey, Chandler, can we please try and stay
focused on my problem here, you know?

290
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:33,875
l'm talking about you,
you big, big freak.

291
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:40,048
You're out of your mind!

292
00:19:40,224 --> 00:19:42,886
Hey, you've done nothing
but talk about her for 48 hours.

293
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:45,494
lf you were in school,
you'd be pulling her pigtails...

294
00:19:45,663 --> 00:19:47,893
...and pushing her down now.

295
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:49,054
Oh, yeah?

296
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:53,567
Then how come l keep thinking about her
in all these sexual scenarios and stuff?

297
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:03,937
Happy? ls that what l'm
supposed to be, Vic? Happy?

298
00:20:04,248 --> 00:20:07,081
Well, why don't you tell me
what you're supposed to be?

299
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:09,242
Because l sure as hell
can't figure it out.

300
00:20:09,854 --> 00:20:12,015
l talk to you, and it's nothing.

301
00:20:12,556 --> 00:20:15,491
You look at me, and nothing.

302
00:20:28,305 --> 00:20:29,533
Nothing.

303
00:20:31,642 --> 00:20:35,942
You guys make me fly!

304
00:20:37,815 --> 00:20:39,180
High!

305
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:43,152
Okay, we're gonna
pick it up here, tomorrow.

306
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:47,823
-Well, that was....
-Better?

307
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:51,220
Yeah. Yeah, it was definitely...

308
00:20:51,395 --> 00:20:53,590
...an improvement.

309
00:20:54,498 --> 00:20:56,466
-Good night.
-Kate.

310
00:20:58,469 --> 00:20:59,902
You forgot your shoes.

311
00:21:02,406 --> 00:21:05,000
l'm probably gonna need those, huh?

312
00:21:09,914 --> 00:21:11,973
Hey, listen, do you...

313
00:21:12,449 --> 00:21:14,110
...feel like getting
a cup of coffee?

314
00:21:16,086 --> 00:21:17,110
-Kate.
-Yeah.

315
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:19,846
-You ready to go?
-Yeah.

316
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:24,222
Very nice. Very nice.

317
00:21:26,163 --> 00:21:28,188
So....

318
00:21:28,632 --> 00:21:30,600
-See you tomorrow, huh?
-Yeah. Sure.

319
00:21:30,768 --> 00:21:32,895
-Right.
-Good night.

320
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:43,737
Hey.

321
00:21:45,449 --> 00:21:47,644
Why isn't it ''Spiderman''?

322
00:21:47,952 --> 00:21:49,817
You know? Like Goldman, Silverman?

323
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:53,020
Because it's not his last name.

324
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,384
lt isn't?

325
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:56,287
No. lt's not, like...

326
00:21:56,527 --> 00:21:58,222
...like, Phil Spiderman.

327
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:02,392
He's a spider...

328
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:04,692
...man.

329
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:08,362
You know, like,
Goldman is a last name.

330
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:11,130
But there's no Gold Man.

331
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:13,573
Okay.

332
00:22:13,744 --> 00:22:15,405
There should be a Gold Man!

333
00:22:17,982 --> 00:22:19,643
-Hey.
-Hey, Rach.

334
00:22:19,817 --> 00:22:21,444
-How was work?
-Oh, it was great.

335
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:24,782
Although l did sit down
where there wasn't a chair.

336
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:27,890
By the way, Ross dropped by
a box of your stuff.

337
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:31,619
Oh. Well, l guess l had
that one coming.

338
00:22:31,795 --> 00:22:35,663
l'm just gonna throw it out.
lt's probably just shampoo and--

339
00:22:36,901 --> 00:22:38,368
Something wrong?

340
00:22:47,778 --> 00:22:50,178
No. Nothing.

341
00:22:55,653 --> 00:22:59,350
So, what kind of powers
would Gold Man have?

342
00:23:00,424 --> 00:23:03,757
Okay. Well, he would
turn things to gold.

343
00:23:03,928 --> 00:23:06,123
What about things that are already gold?

344
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:08,197
His work is done.

345
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:12,964
Okay, l have a friend, Jimmy Tupperman,
what would his powers be?

346
00:23:13,137 --> 00:23:15,605
Tupper Man.

347
00:23:16,373 --> 00:23:19,365
He would keep criminals fresh
until the police came.

348
00:23:21,946 --> 00:23:24,437
-Okay. Let's play my game now.
-Okay.

349
00:23:24,615 --> 00:23:28,483
All right, you yellow-bellied,
lily-livered-- Draw!
