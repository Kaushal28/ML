1
00:00:14,126 --> 00:00:16,651
What the hell is that?!

2
00:00:19,565 --> 00:00:22,534
What the hell is that?
ls that you?

3
00:00:29,474 --> 00:00:32,705
-You're really not a morning person.
-Just back off!

4
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,214
Get up! Get up! Get up!

5
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:44,715
What is that noise?

6
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,321
You!

7
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,819
lt's the chick.

8
00:00:51,063 --> 00:00:53,258
She's going through some changes.

9
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,832
What kind of changes?

10
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:58,092
The vet seems to think...

11
00:00:58,303 --> 00:01:00,601
...she's becoming a rooster.

12
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:05,336
We're getting a second opinion.

13
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:09,303
The One With the Embryos

14
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:58,852
Why are you shopping
at 8 in the morning?

15
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:00,588
l've been up since 6...

16
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,427
...thanks to somebody's
dumb-ass rooster.

17
00:02:04,302 --> 00:02:08,398
You should get rid of those animals.
They shouldn't be in an apartment.

18
00:02:08,707 --> 00:02:12,006
Especially not with these
knives and cookbooks around.

19
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:17,046
l'm going to the doctor
and see if l'm ready...

20
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:21,549
...to have Frank and Alice's embryo
transferred into my uterus.

21
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:24,548
How will they know?

22
00:02:24,756 --> 00:02:28,089
They'll just see if my
endometrial layer is thick.

23
00:02:28,293 --> 00:02:30,853
l can check that for you.

24
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:33,062
Okay, think ''thick.''

25
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:35,059
Good luck!

26
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:37,557
Wish me luck.

27
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:39,360
Good luck.

28
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:42,870
-l'm still right.
-That is so not true.

29
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:44,200
What?

30
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:46,809
l know it's her laundry day...

31
00:02:47,012 --> 00:02:50,675
...and that means she's wearing
her old-lady underpants.

32
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,041
l can check that for you.

33
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:57,653
You two think you know
me and Rachel...

34
00:02:57,889 --> 00:02:59,584
...better than we know you.

35
00:03:00,392 --> 00:03:02,587
Well, we do.

36
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:06,063
You can only eat Tic Tacs
in even numbers.

37
00:03:06,398 --> 00:03:08,229
What's that about?

38
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,926
And you!
Ross, if you check Rachel's bag...

39
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,003
...you'll find a half-eaten box
of cookies in there.

40
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:20,772
You're good.

41
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:23,877
These are not.

42
00:03:24,382 --> 00:03:27,840
l'm so not impressed.
Everybody snacks when they shop.

43
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:31,045
Ross, how many items
left in that bag?

44
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:32,245
Five.

45
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:37,220
Okay, 1 0 bucks says we can
name every item in that bag.

46
00:03:37,996 --> 00:03:40,521
-How many guesses?
-Six.

47
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:42,324
Challenge extended.

48
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:47,831
-Deal!
-Challenge accepted.

49
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:50,666
All right, we'll start with...

50
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,499
...apples.

51
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:55,770
We'll be starting with apples.

52
00:03:57,883 --> 00:03:59,817
Stop that now.

53
00:04:01,787 --> 00:04:02,776
Yes.

54
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:05,318
Okay. Tortilla chips.

55
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:07,047
-Yogurt.
-Diet soda.

56
00:04:11,763 --> 00:04:15,096
-Orange juice.
-There's no orange juice! We win!

57
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,430
They have another guess.

58
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,267
Well, we won that one.

59
00:04:21,406 --> 00:04:23,533
Okay. The last thing is--

60
00:04:27,646 --> 00:04:30,410
Not for another two weeks.

61
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:34,676
l got it.

62
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,048
Scotch...

63
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:37,245
...tape.

64
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:45,352
How did you know
she would buy Scotch tape?

65
00:04:45,564 --> 00:04:48,499
We used up theirs last night
making scary faces.

66
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:51,329
Oh, man!

67
00:04:51,536 --> 00:04:54,164
All right! Ten bucks.
Fork it over.

68
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,374
Cough it up. Pay the piper.

69
00:04:58,143 --> 00:04:59,269
Give me it!

70
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,174
You don't know us better.
l want a rematch.

71
00:05:03,448 --> 00:05:06,679
And no stupid grocery questions.
Real, personal questions.

72
00:05:06,952 --> 00:05:09,443
And the winner gets $ 1 00.

73
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:13,482
-Serious?
-Are you scared?

74
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:16,019
No.

75
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:19,527
Who makes up the questions?

76
00:05:19,798 --> 00:05:20,958
Ross will do it.

77
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:23,894
Sure, Ross will do it.

78
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:28,195
lt's not like he has a job
or a child or a life of his own.

79
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:31,739
-Fine. We'll ask Phoebe.
-No, l want to play.

80
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:40,184
Looks like your uterus
is ready for implantation.

81
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:43,912
l knew it!
l felt really thick this morning.

82
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:48,349
Okay, so what's now?
Go get the eggs. Put them in there.

83
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:51,926
lt'll take a little while
to prepare the embryos.

84
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,132
-Embryos? As in more than one?
-Five, actually.

85
00:05:56,468 --> 00:05:58,459
Where am l giving birth...

86
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,468
...in a hospital or
a big box under the stairs?

87
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,402
Doing five gives you a 25% chance
that at least one will attach.

88
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:08,509
That's it? 25%?

89
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:12,513
That means that it's, like,
75% chance of no baby at all?

90
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:14,912
l was thinking,
what are the odds...

91
00:06:15,153 --> 00:06:17,713
...if you stuff 200 of them in there?

92
00:06:19,324 --> 00:06:20,621
Sweetie, now...

93
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:23,759
...she's a woman,
not a gumball machine.

94
00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:31,333
Don't worry. l'll do this as many
times as it takes to get it right.

95
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:35,095
The thing is, we kind of
only have one shot.

96
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:39,343
lt costs $ 1 6,000 each time you do this.

97
00:06:39,678 --> 00:06:42,169
Sixteen thousand dollars?!

98
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:46,341
Well, it's 20 in California.

99
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:51,654
We're kind of using all the money
we have to do it this one time.

100
00:06:54,192 --> 00:06:57,821
Okay, that's a lot of
pressure on me and my uterus.

101
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:04,300
Maybe there's something l can do
to make sure l get pregnant.

102
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:05,867
No, l'm sorry.

103
00:07:06,137 --> 00:07:08,731
Wow, you guys really
don't know anything.

104
00:07:10,175 --> 00:07:14,976
Why don't you get drunk? lt worked
for a bunch of girls in my high school.

105
00:07:22,187 --> 00:07:26,317
-So how's the test coming?
-Hey, you're touching the game board.

106
00:07:27,058 --> 00:07:28,719
Sorry.

107
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,021
You freak.

108
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:36,891
Do you realize that
any minute now...

109
00:07:37,102 --> 00:07:38,592
...Phoebe could be pregnant?

110
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,895
l know, l know.

111
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:44,005
lt's such a huge,
life-altering thing.

112
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:47,738
The test is ready.

113
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:54,608
Okay. Each team will
answer 1 0 questions.

114
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:58,720
The first team to answer
the most questions wins.

115
00:07:58,923 --> 00:08:02,415
The categories are
''Fears and Pet Peeves'' ...

116
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:04,355
...''Ancient History'' ...

117
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:06,120
...''Literature'' ...

118
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:08,696
...and ''lt's all Relative.''

119
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:11,528
Now...

120
00:08:11,803 --> 00:08:15,295
...the coin toss,
to see who goes first.

121
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:23,913
Okay.

122
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:26,381
Somebody call it this time.

123
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:29,046
Tails!

124
00:08:29,654 --> 00:08:30,916
lt's heads.

125
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,225
Gentlemen, pick your category.

126
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:37,427
''Fears and Pet Peeves.''

127
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:41,457
''What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?''

128
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,597
-Animals dressed as humans.
-Correct.

129
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:48,696
-Ladies?
-Same category.

130
00:08:50,642 --> 00:08:55,136
''According to Chandler, what phenomenon
scares the bejesus out of him?''

131
00:08:56,614 --> 00:08:59,344
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!

132
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:02,877
That is correct.

133
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:06,855
The lrish jig guy?

134
00:09:07,058 --> 00:09:11,188
His legs flail about
as if independent from his body!

135
00:09:12,764 --> 00:09:14,163
Gentlemen, your pick.

136
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:15,730
''lt's all Relative.''

137
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:19,228
''Monica and l had
a grandmother who died.

138
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:21,563
You both went to her funeral.

139
00:09:22,073 --> 00:09:24,166
Name that grandmother.''

140
00:09:26,678 --> 00:09:29,772
-Nana?
-She has a real name.

141
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:31,507
Althea!

142
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:33,047
-What?
-l took a shot!

143
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:34,240
With Althea?

144
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:36,954
-Althea is correct.
-Nice shooting!

145
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,853
''Literature.''

146
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:47,157
''Every week the <i>TV Guide</i> comes
to Chandler and Joey's apartment.

147
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:50,459
What name appears
on the address label?''

148
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:53,637
Chandler gets it!
lt's Chandler Bing!

149
00:09:54,305 --> 00:09:58,469
l'm afraid the <i>TV Guide</i>
comes to ''Chanandler Bong.''

150
00:10:01,546 --> 00:10:03,013
l knew that!

151
00:10:03,214 --> 00:10:05,182
Rachel, use your head!

152
00:10:06,718 --> 00:10:09,346
Actually, it's Ms. Chanandler Bong.

153
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:19,289
Hello, teeny embryos.

154
00:10:20,965 --> 00:10:23,058
l'm Phoebe Buffay. Hi!

155
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:28,672
l'm hoping to be your uterus
for the next nine months.

156
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:31,836
We're doing this
for Frank and Alice...

157
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:34,510
...who you know.
You've been there.

158
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:39,342
They want you so much.

159
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:43,247
So when you guys get in there,
really grab on.

160
00:10:43,888 --> 00:10:47,153
And l promise that l'll keep you
safe and warm...

161
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:50,555
...until you're ready
to have them take you home.

162
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:59,362
Next time you see me,
if l'm screaming, don't worry.

163
00:10:59,604 --> 00:11:01,868
That's what's supposed to happen.

164
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:05,001
Ready?

165
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:07,673
Good luck!

166
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:13,180
The score is nine to eight
in favor of the guys.

167
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:17,047
Ladies, if you miss this,
the game is theirs. Pick a category.

168
00:11:17,255 --> 00:11:18,916
''lt's all Relative'' !

169
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:23,853
-You don't have to shout everything.
-l'm sorry!

170
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:30,432
''What is the name
of Chandler's father's...

171
00:11:30,702 --> 00:11:33,603
...Las Vegas all-male burlesque?''

172
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:36,863
<i>Viva Las Gaygas</i>!

173
00:11:38,943 --> 00:11:41,036
Unfortunately, that is correct.

174
00:11:42,981 --> 00:11:45,609
All right. We have a tie.

175
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:49,810
Luckily, l've prepared
for such an event.

176
00:11:51,422 --> 00:11:52,946
The lightning round!

177
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:59,856
Thirty seconds.
All the questions you can answer.

178
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:01,962
You guys are dead!

179
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,600
l am so good at lightning rounds!

180
00:12:06,437 --> 00:12:08,997
l majored in lightning rounds,
all right?

181
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:10,469
We'll destroy you.

182
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:11,664
Want to bet?

183
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,509
l'm so confused as to what
we've been doing so far.

184
00:12:16,948 --> 00:12:20,008
How about we play for more money?
Say 1 50?

185
00:12:20,218 --> 00:12:23,119
One hundred and fifty dollars.

186
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:26,456
Say 200?

187
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:29,024
Two hundred dollars!

188
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,688
You're doing it again.

189
00:12:30,895 --> 00:12:32,624
Excuse me.

190
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:35,960
-l don't want to lose $200.
-We won't.

191
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:38,567
Three hundred?

192
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:40,669
l'm spicing it up!

193
00:12:40,872 --> 00:12:44,239
So play for some pepper!
Stop spending my money.

194
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:46,732
l got it!

195
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:50,503
lf we win, they have to
get rid of the rooster.

196
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:52,512
That's interesting!

197
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,751
-No way! That rooster's family.
-The duck too!

198
00:12:55,987 --> 00:12:57,978
The duck doesn't make noise!

199
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:00,453
He gets the other one all riled up!

200
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:03,620
-We are not--
-All right, hold on!

201
00:13:05,563 --> 00:13:06,791
lf you win...

202
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:08,825
...we give up the bird.

203
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:13,402
But if we win...

204
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:16,370
...we get your apartment.

205
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,575
-Deal!
-What?

206
00:13:23,314 --> 00:13:27,842
That's crazy. There's no way
we are betting the apartment.

207
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:35,956
All right, l'm in. Because either
he goes, or l'm buying a coyote.

208
00:13:47,972 --> 00:13:50,702
Betting the apartment?
l don't know about this.

209
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:54,510
l have not missed one question
the whole game. l own this game!

210
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:58,137
-Look at my hand.
-You have the answers written there?

211
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:02,614
No. Steady as a rock.
Now, are you with me?

212
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:05,479
All right, let's do it!

213
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:09,616
All right.
Gentlemen, you're up first.

214
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:12,487
You have 30 seconds.

215
00:14:13,464 --> 00:14:15,659
The lightning round begins--

216
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:17,334
Stop it!

217
00:14:19,303 --> 00:14:22,397
''Monica's nickname
when she was a hockey goalie?''

218
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:24,404
-Big Fat Goalie.
-Correct!

219
00:14:27,111 --> 00:14:29,511
''Rachel claims
it's her favorite movie.''

220
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:31,112
<i>Dangerous Liaisons.</i>

221
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,044
-''Her actual favorite is...?''
-<i>Weekend at Bernie's.</i>

222
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,454
''ln what part of her body did Monica
get a pencil stuck at age 1 4?''

223
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:45,691
No!

224
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:49,190
Her ear!

225
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:56,566
''Monica categorizes her towels.
How many categories are there?''

226
00:14:56,941 --> 00:14:57,999
-Everyday use.
-Fancy.

227
00:14:58,209 --> 00:14:59,642
-Guest.
-Fancy guest.

228
00:14:59,877 --> 00:15:02,846
-Two seconds.
-Eleven?

229
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,141
Unbelievable!
Eleven is correct!

230
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:10,276
All right.

231
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:12,752
That's four for the guys.
Ladies, you're up!

232
00:15:18,596 --> 00:15:20,587
Thirty seconds on the clock.

233
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:23,392
Five correct questions
wins the game.

234
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:27,202
The lightning round begins now.
''Joey's favorite food?''

235
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:28,838
-Sandwiches!
-Correct.

236
00:15:29,106 --> 00:15:31,506
''Chandler was how old when he
first touched a girl's breast?''

237
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:33,073
-1 4?
-No, 1 9.

238
00:15:33,277 --> 00:15:34,403
Thanks, man.

239
00:15:35,146 --> 00:15:37,512
''Joey had an imaginary
childhood friend.

240
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:39,181
-His name was...?''
-Maurice!

241
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:42,443
-''His profession was...?''
-Space cowboy!

242
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:45,846
''What is Chandler Bing's job?''

243
00:15:50,094 --> 00:15:52,324
lt has something to do with numbers!

244
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,691
-And processing!
-He carries a briefcase.

245
00:15:54,932 --> 00:15:57,298
Ten seconds.
You need this or you lose.

246
00:15:57,502 --> 00:15:59,697
Something to do
with transponding.

247
00:15:59,971 --> 00:16:02,337
He's a transponster!

248
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:06,373
That's not even a word!

249
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:10,537
l can get this! l can get this!

250
00:16:27,331 --> 00:16:30,858
-l call Monica's room.
-You can't just call Monica's room.

251
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:33,103
Sure l can.
Standard shotgun rules.

252
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:35,772
l'm in sight of the room
and l called it.

253
00:16:37,642 --> 00:16:39,303
<i>Damn!</i>

254
00:16:39,877 --> 00:16:42,607
l feel like l'm coming down
with something.

255
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:46,983
Guess the color of my tonsils.
l bet the apartment!

256
00:16:47,218 --> 00:16:49,778
l would never bet this place.
lt's too nice.

257
00:16:53,424 --> 00:16:54,550
Are they in there?

258
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,556
Yeah, l'm implanted.

259
00:16:57,061 --> 00:16:59,825
-How do you feel?
-Well, freaked.

260
00:17:01,432 --> 00:17:04,128
lt turns out the odds
are really sucky.

261
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:06,996
And this is
Frank and Alice's only shot.

262
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:10,741
They are literally putting
all their eggs in my basket.

263
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:14,005
But l bet it works.

264
00:17:14,312 --> 00:17:16,405
Really? How much?

265
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:21,011
l'm going to take
a pregnancy test now.

266
00:17:21,252 --> 00:17:23,152
Wow! You can tell this soon?

267
00:17:23,354 --> 00:17:25,618
The doctor says it takes a few days.

268
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:29,950
But my body's always been a little
faster than Western medicine.

269
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:37,199
l can't believe you guys think
you're moving in here.

270
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:39,594
Well, believe it, baby!

271
00:17:41,172 --> 00:17:43,766
-Well, l'm not moving.
-What?

272
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:48,367
No. lt was a stupid bet.
We were just playing a game.

273
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:50,706
You can't ignore the bet.
lt's a bet!

274
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:53,781
Bet on a bet
and if you lose, you lose the bet.

275
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:56,110
We have to move.

276
00:17:56,354 --> 00:17:59,687
We would have made them
get rid of the birds.

277
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:07,789
l hate this as much as you,
but if it makes you feel better...

278
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:10,260
...this is all your fault.

279
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:12,424
What?

280
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:16,369
Chanandler Bong!
We steal that <i>TV Guide</i> every week!

281
00:18:16,574 --> 00:18:18,599
l knew it!

282
00:18:19,577 --> 00:18:21,807
l don't care.
l'm not going anywhere.

283
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:24,241
Cool! Girl roommate.

284
00:18:27,918 --> 00:18:28,907
Well?

285
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:31,751
Nope, not knocked up yet.

286
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:34,248
lt's only been a couple hours.

287
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:38,292
Meanwhile, l'll do
whatever l can to help this.

288
00:18:38,496 --> 00:18:41,954
l'm just going to, you know,
lie in your chair, okay?

289
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:46,933
Good. l'm going
to let gravity do its job.

290
00:18:48,506 --> 00:18:49,871
l won't get in the way.

291
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:54,273
lt'll be just like that time l tried to
count all the bumps on your ceiling.

292
00:18:55,446 --> 00:19:00,611
You know, Pheebs, if you sit there long
enough, you'll be sitting in our apartment.

293
00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:02,275
l can't believe this.

294
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,880
Oh, Rach, FYl: Your new apartment
hasn't had hot water since Christmas.

295
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:13,189
Can you give me a hand?

296
00:19:13,431 --> 00:19:16,923
Put that box down!
We are not going anywhere!

297
00:19:18,135 --> 00:19:20,933
This is my apartment and l like it!

298
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:23,299
This is a girl's apartment!

299
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:27,875
That is a boy's apartment!
lt's dirty and it smells!

300
00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:30,979
This is pretty!
lt's so pretty!

301
00:19:31,248 --> 00:19:33,478
And look, it's purple!

302
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:37,085
l tell you, you with your
steady hand, l am not moving.

303
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:40,381
And now l have got the steady hand.

304
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,254
Okay, okay.

305
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:49,396
-l'll take care of it.
-That's right.

306
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:51,498
You do what the hand says!

307
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:05,908
-How'd it go?
-l lost our mattresses.

308
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:16,051
<i>Are you in there, little fetus?</i>
<i>In nine months will you come greet us?</i>

309
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:21,123
<i>I will buy you some Adidas</i>

310
00:20:28,205 --> 00:20:32,437
We were just at the drugstore
so we got you a little present.

311
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,974
That's where all my blood was.

312
00:20:36,113 --> 00:20:40,072
lt's a lollipop
and a home pregnancy test.

313
00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:44,511
Don't mix those up.
You could really ruin that lollipop.

314
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,256
You feel like taking a test?
There's only one question.

315
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,533
All right. l will.

316
00:20:57,835 --> 00:21:00,360
Remember that
it's still really early.

317
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:05,507
lf it says l'm not pregnant, that
doesn't mean l won't get pregnant.

318
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:08,507
Just so l don't go completely nuts...

319
00:21:08,712 --> 00:21:11,476
...try not to put
all your hopes on this.

320
00:21:15,786 --> 00:21:16,775
Great.

321
00:21:25,362 --> 00:21:29,128
You are mean boys
who are just being mean!

322
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:32,597
Don't get mad! No one
forced you to raise the stakes.

323
00:21:32,803 --> 00:21:35,294
That is not true!
She forced me!

324
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:38,064
You got the question wrong.

325
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:40,573
lt was a stupid, unfair question!

326
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:42,405
Don't blame the questions!

327
00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:46,947
Stop yelling in our apartment!
You are ruining moving day for us.

328
00:21:47,184 --> 00:21:49,846
-Stop calling it your apartment!
-lt is!

329
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:56,255
You're going to have a baby.
They're going to have a baby!

330
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,965
My sister's going to have my baby!

331
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:17,638
Okay, but this can't
be good for the baby.

332
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,585
l can't find garbage bags.

333
00:22:31,862 --> 00:22:33,989
l think l saw some in here.

334
00:22:38,836 --> 00:22:40,394
What is it?

335
00:22:41,071 --> 00:22:45,007
l don't know. But maybe if we keep
that drawer shut, it'll die.

336
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,343
l can't believe we're living here!

337
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:56,213
What is it?

338
00:22:56,453 --> 00:22:58,978
Did you see the size of the closets?

339
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:03,218
l can't believe we live here!
