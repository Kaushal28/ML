1
00:00:02,314 --> 00:00:06,045
Janice has a question.
Who of the six of you...

2
00:00:06,218 --> 00:00:09,949
...has slept with
who of the six of you?

3
00:00:11,123 --> 00:00:13,455
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,957
l'm sorry, the answer there
would be none of us.

5
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:20,391
Yeah. You know what?
lf that doesn't change soon...

6
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:23,126
...l'm going to dump you
for somebody who puts out.

7
00:00:23,302 --> 00:00:26,931
Come on. Over the years, none of you
ever got, you know, drunk and stupid?

8
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:29,767
Well, that's really
a different question.

9
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:33,544
l find it hard to believe
that a group of people who spends...

10
00:00:33,712 --> 00:00:37,443
...as much time together as you
guys do has never bumped uglies.

11
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:42,077
Well, there was that one time
that Monica and Rachel got together.

12
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:44,021
-What?
-What?

13
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:46,822
Excuse me, there was no time.

14
00:00:46,992 --> 00:00:49,552
Okay, but let's say there was.

15
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:51,491
How might that go?

16
00:00:52,998 --> 00:00:55,899
Okay. Okay.
Well, then answer me this:

17
00:00:56,168 --> 00:01:00,161
Have any of you ever almost...?

18
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:06,836
-Anybody need more coffee?
-Hey, there's a dog out there!

19
00:01:07,512 --> 00:01:09,810
The One With the Flashback

20
00:01:55,594 --> 00:01:58,222
-That is so unfortunate.
-What?

21
00:01:58,397 --> 00:02:01,025
Cute Naked Guy's really
starting to put on weight.

22
00:02:02,668 --> 00:02:04,602
l'll be back in just a minute.

23
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:09,239
Oh, Phoebe, l'm sorry that l left
lipstick marks on the phone.

24
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:11,899
You didn't leave lipstick marks
on the phone.

25
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:14,908
Then it must have been you. Bye.

26
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:17,070
Bye-bye.

27
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,484
-That's why l moved out.
-Hey, while we're on that...

28
00:02:21,653 --> 00:02:25,248
...when are you gonna tell my sister
you don't live here anymore?

29
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:27,657
l think on some level,
she already knows.

30
00:02:27,926 --> 00:02:30,417
She doesn't know that
you sneak out every night.

31
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:32,358
She doesn't know
that you sneak back...

32
00:02:32,597 --> 00:02:35,794
...and she doesn't know you've been
at your grandmother's for a week.

33
00:02:36,034 --> 00:02:38,025
Okay, well, maybe not on those levels.

34
00:02:38,704 --> 00:02:40,171
You have got to tell her.

35
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:42,863
The longer you wait,
the harder it is going to be on her.

36
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,441
You're right. You're right.

37
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,805
Anyway, listen, tonight's bag...

38
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:50,413
...is really bulky.
So could you sneak stuff out for me?

39
00:02:50,582 --> 00:02:53,073
lt's just like a clock radio
and some cemetery dirt.

40
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,615
-Hey.
-Hey.

41
00:03:00,392 --> 00:03:03,020
l'm never gonna find a roommate.
Ever.

42
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:04,184
Nobody good?

43
00:03:04,362 --> 00:03:06,922
Well, let's see.
There was the guy with the ferrets.

44
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:08,088
That's plural.

45
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:12,961
The spitter. And the guy
who enjoyed my name so much...

46
00:03:13,238 --> 00:03:15,934
...he felt the need to make
a noise every time he said it.

47
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:18,770
''Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing.
Bing!''

48
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:22,444
''Great apartment, Chandler Bing.
Bing!''

49
00:03:22,614 --> 00:03:24,605
-How many more do you have tomorrow?
-Two.

50
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:27,081
This photographer
who seemed really dull...

51
00:03:27,252 --> 00:03:30,653
...and this actor guy who
l'm not sure about because...

52
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:32,790
...when l answered the phone
''Chandler Bing'' ...

53
00:03:32,991 --> 00:03:35,482
...he said, ''Whoa! Short message!''

54
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:40,924
Foot on the floor
or come over no more.

55
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:45,025
Sure, your dresser is missing,
but this she notices.

56
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,262
-What?
-l have to go.

57
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:52,442
Carol should be home by now, so....

58
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:55,373
-How's it going with you guys?
-Better, actually.

59
00:03:55,547 --> 00:03:58,880
l think l finally figured out why we
were having so much trouble lately.

60
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,575
-Oh, really?
-Yeah. You know how l have you guys?

61
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,380
She doesn't have any close
friends that are just hers.

62
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:09,255
But last week, she met this woman
at the gym, Susan something.

63
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:14,190
And they really hit it off, and
l think it's gonna make a difference.

64
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:18,431
So, Eric...

65
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,763
...what kind of photography do you do?

66
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:22,462
Oh, mostly fashion.

67
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:25,574
So there may be models here
sometimes. l hope that's cool.

68
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:29,246
Yes, that is cool.

69
00:04:29,948 --> 00:04:32,382
Because l have models here,
you know...

70
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:35,677
...never.

71
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:37,344
What else?

72
00:04:37,522 --> 00:04:40,958
During the summer l spend most
weekends at my sister's beach house...

73
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:42,821
...which you are welcome to use.

74
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:46,586
Although l should probably tell you,
she's a porn star.

75
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:51,968
Well, listen, l still have
one more person to meet...

76
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,105
...but unless it turns out
to be your sister...

77
00:04:55,674 --> 00:04:57,972
...l think your chances
are pretty good.

78
00:04:58,677 --> 00:04:59,837
All right.

79
00:05:04,282 --> 00:05:06,113
Bedroom, bathroom, living room.

80
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:10,277
This right here is the kitchen,
and thanks for coming by. Bye-bye.

81
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:13,480
Don't you wanna
ask me any questions?

82
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:17,421
Sure.

83
00:05:18,964 --> 00:05:21,057
What's up?

84
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:23,958
Well, l'm an actor.

85
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:25,363
l'm fairly neat.

86
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:28,404
l got my own TV.

87
00:05:28,573 --> 00:05:32,168
Oh, and don't worry, l'm totally
okay with the gay thing.

88
00:05:35,046 --> 00:05:36,343
What gay thing?

89
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:42,210
Just, you know, in general.
The whole people being gay thing.

90
00:05:43,622 --> 00:05:45,112
Totally cool with that.

91
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:51,387
Okay, Jerry.
Thanks for stopping by.

92
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:57,096
-Hi.
-Hey.

93
00:05:59,638 --> 00:06:00,730
Oh, my God!

94
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:10,473
Hey, Mon.

95
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:14,919
-Wanna hear something that sucks?
-Do l ever!

96
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:18,885
-Chris says they're closing down the bar.
-No way!

97
00:06:19,057 --> 00:06:21,321
Apparently, they're turning
it into a coffee place.

98
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:22,824
Just coffee?

99
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:26,326
-Where are we gonna hang out now?
-You got me.

100
00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:29,023
-Can l get a beer, please?
-Hey, did you pick a roommate?

101
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:31,202
-You betcha.
-ls it the ltalian guy?

102
00:06:31,703 --> 00:06:32,692
Yeah, right.

103
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:35,395
He's so cute.

104
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:38,269
That's what l want.
A roommate l can walk around with...

105
00:06:38,476 --> 00:06:40,808
...and be referred to as the funny one.

106
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:43,846
Pool table's free. Rack them up.
Back in a minute.

107
00:06:44,015 --> 00:06:46,245
Get ready for me to whip your butt.

108
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:49,579
Okay, but after that,
we're shooting some pool.

109
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:54,759
No, no, no, no.
Excuse me? Hello? Hi.

110
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:58,158
My friend ordered an onion...

111
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,227
...not an olive.

112
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:03,333
And l ordered a rum and Diet Coke...

113
00:07:03,568 --> 00:07:05,763
...which l don't think this is.

114
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:09,231
-l am so sorry.
-That's all right.

115
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:12,769
l mean, how hard is it to get
a couple drinks right, huh?

116
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:18,640
l would like to propose a toast...

117
00:07:19,284 --> 00:07:22,344
...to the woman who, in one year
from today, will become...

118
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,817
...Mrs. Dr. Barry Barber, D.D.S.

119
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:29,517
l think it's time
to see the ring again.

120
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:38,528
lsn't it exciting? l mean,
it's like having a boyfriend for life.

121
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:43,604
Yeah. l know.

122
00:07:44,442 --> 00:07:45,602
What?

123
00:07:45,777 --> 00:07:47,802
Oh, l don't know.

124
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,472
Well, maybe it's just the idea...

125
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:54,276
...of Barry for the rest of my life.

126
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:58,115
l don't know, l think l....
l feel like l need to have one last fling...

127
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,325
...you know, just to sort of get it
out of my system.

128
00:08:03,628 --> 00:08:06,290
-Rachel, stop!
-You're so bad!

129
00:08:06,464 --> 00:08:10,195
l'm serious. l really think
l need to just have...

130
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:12,561
...some meaningless sex,
you know?

131
00:08:12,804 --> 00:08:15,534
With the next guy l see.

132
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:25,305
Excuse me, l seem to have
dropped my ball.

133
00:08:27,352 --> 00:08:28,376
Yeah, so?

134
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:33,421
And now l've picked it up again.

135
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:39,594
My God!
l went to high school with her.

136
00:08:39,764 --> 00:08:41,254
Rachel!

137
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:42,832
Hi!

138
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:45,299
Monica!

139
00:08:47,405 --> 00:08:49,270
ls she giving me the finger?

140
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:51,173
Monica!

141
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:53,833
Look! Hi! What do you think?

142
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:55,340
Oh, my God!

143
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:58,275
You can't even see
where the Titanic hit it.

144
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,786
Yes, his name is Barry.
He's a doctor, thank you very much.

145
00:09:02,954 --> 00:09:05,252
Just like you always wanted.
Congratulations.

146
00:09:05,423 --> 00:09:09,291
Thank you. So how about you?
Are you seeing anybody?

147
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:10,826
Not right now.

148
00:09:11,229 --> 00:09:12,821
Oh, well, that's okay.

149
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:15,088
l know.

150
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:22,036
So l think l'll get back
to my friend.

151
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:24,573
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.

152
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:31,576
Listen, can we please have lunch
the next time l'm in the city?

153
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:32,909
That'd be great.

154
00:09:33,084 --> 00:09:34,073
-Okay.
-Thanks.

155
00:09:34,252 --> 00:09:35,947
-Bye.
-Bye.

156
00:09:36,387 --> 00:09:40,187
Ten bucks says l never see
that woman again in my life.

157
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:43,293
No, honey, really. lt's fine.

158
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:44,792
Just....

159
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:46,055
Go with Susan.

160
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:47,424
Really, l think--

161
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,726
l think girls' night out
is a great idea.

162
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:54,467
Okay. Okay. Bye.

163
00:09:54,906 --> 00:09:58,273
-So, what are they doing?
-l don't know. Something girly.

164
00:10:02,113 --> 00:10:03,410
Hey, you're early.

165
00:10:03,681 --> 00:10:05,581
What are you doing with the lamp?

166
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:08,052
l'm just taking it to get rewired.

167
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:14,621
Don't take it to the place you took the
stereo. They've had that for over a week.

168
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:25,602
No! Mr. Heckles, no one is making
any noise up here.

169
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,504
You're disturbing my oboe practice.

170
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:32,006
-You don't play the oboe.
-l could play the oboe.

171
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:36,210
Then l'm gonna have to ask you
to keep it down.

172
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:42,143
Who are you?

173
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:44,646
l'm Eric, l'm gonna be
Chandler's new roommate.

174
00:10:44,822 --> 00:10:46,187
l'm Chandler's new roommate.

175
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,060
-l don't think so.
-l could be Chandler's new roommate.

176
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:54,697
-But he told me over the phone--
-He told me in person.

177
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:57,025
That's weird.

178
00:10:57,202 --> 00:11:00,399
Well, l'm going to go into
my new apartment now.

179
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,686
Hi, again.

180
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:23,551
Hey.

181
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:29,488
Hey.

182
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,134
Thank you so much.

183
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:34,702
No, no, no. Don't thank me.
Thank the jerk that didn't show up.

184
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:36,839
Okay, l gotta get to work.

185
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:39,738
And not just for the money.
But because every now and then...

186
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:44,041
...someone walks out of the bathroom with
a little bit of toilet paper on their shoe.

187
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:51,680
-You need some help with that?
-No, thanks. l got it.

188
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:53,517
No. No, l don't!

189
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:54,953
Okay?

190
00:11:57,729 --> 00:12:00,220
Stood up too fast.
Got a little head rush.

191
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:02,565
lt's the heat.

192
00:12:05,903 --> 00:12:07,564
And the humidity.

193
00:12:10,008 --> 00:12:11,305
That's a....

194
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:13,340
That's a tough combination.

195
00:12:17,815 --> 00:12:20,249
Do you want to come in
for some lemonade?

196
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:23,687
Like you wouldn't believe.

197
00:12:29,494 --> 00:12:31,189
This is a great place.

198
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:33,521
Thank you.

199
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:36,865
Just make yourself comfortable.

200
00:12:37,702 --> 00:12:39,067
Gotcha.

201
00:12:41,606 --> 00:12:44,632
So this place is really
my grandmother's.

202
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,870
l got it from her
when she moved to Florida.

203
00:12:50,048 --> 00:12:53,279
Otherwise l could never
afford a place like this.

204
00:12:57,188 --> 00:12:58,815
So if the landlord ever asks...

205
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:02,754
...l'm an 87-year-old woman who's
afraid of her VCR. You thirsty?

206
00:13:02,927 --> 00:13:05,054
You bet l am!

207
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:07,553
Okay...

208
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:09,131
...here's your penis!

209
00:13:12,503 --> 00:13:15,666
Oh, my God!
What the hell are you doing?

210
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,104
You said, ''You wanna come
in for some lemonade?''

211
00:13:18,276 --> 00:13:19,641
So?

212
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:23,714
Were you just gonna give me lemonade?

213
00:13:25,183 --> 00:13:26,241
Cover yourself up!

214
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:27,912
Oh, right. Sorry.

215
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:29,677
God, l don't believe this!

216
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:33,653
Someone asks you in for lemonade and to
you that means they want to have sex?

217
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:36,793
Usually, yeah.
Well, not just lemonade.

218
00:13:36,994 --> 00:13:39,258
lced tea, sometimes juice.

219
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:43,193
Look, sorry. l just--

220
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:45,163
l thought you liked me.

221
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:47,234
l'm such a jerk.

222
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:50,498
lt's okay.

223
00:13:51,876 --> 00:13:54,242
l suppose it could happen to anyone.

224
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:56,208
Not anyone l know, but....

225
00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:01,549
By the way, l can still see it.

226
00:14:13,097 --> 00:14:14,462
-Pheebs?
-Huh?

227
00:14:14,632 --> 00:14:15,792
Where's your bed?

228
00:14:18,936 --> 00:14:21,200
lt's not in the apartment?

229
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:25,401
Oh, no.

230
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:29,369
l can't believe this
is happening again.

231
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:33,940
-What?
-Okay, enough with the third degree!

232
00:14:35,853 --> 00:14:38,253
l don't live here anymore.

233
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,884
-What are you talking about?
-l'm sorry.

234
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:45,152
l don't live here anymore.

235
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:51,027
l didn't know how to tell you.
But, you know, everybody else knows.

236
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:55,532
Everybody knows?

237
00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:59,208
That was supposed to be a good thing.
l forget why.

238
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,306
l don't understand.
l thought we were doing better lately.

239
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,505
Yeah, 'cause l moved out.

240
00:15:06,551 --> 00:15:07,677
Monica, l....

241
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:10,616
Do you know, okay, l couldn't
sleep for, like, a month...

242
00:15:10,788 --> 00:15:14,087
...because l got a dot of ink
on one of the sofa cushions?

243
00:15:14,725 --> 00:15:16,955
Well, you could've just
turned the cushion over.

244
00:15:17,128 --> 00:15:20,188
l would have, except l had
a spaghetti stain on the other side.

245
00:15:20,531 --> 00:15:21,520
What?

246
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:23,633
Okay. This is what l'm talking about.

247
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:27,393
l need to live in a land
where people can spill!

248
00:15:28,506 --> 00:15:30,133
Well, you can spill.

249
00:15:30,775 --> 00:15:32,106
ln the sink.

250
00:15:32,944 --> 00:15:37,176
Oh, honey. lt's not your fault,
you know. This is who you are.

251
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:40,407
And l love you.
And l want us to be friends.

252
00:15:40,618 --> 00:15:43,314
And if l keep living here,
l don't see that happening.

253
00:15:45,423 --> 00:15:47,857
-l love you too.
-Oh, good.

254
00:15:51,195 --> 00:15:52,856
What?

255
00:15:53,898 --> 00:15:55,525
What? l'm just sad.

256
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:58,929
No, you're not.
You're wondering which cushion it is.

257
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:03,963
Well, why can't l think of both?
l mean, l can think two things.

258
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:07,772
Go ahead. Look.
You know you want to. Go.

259
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:10,809
Oh, my God!

260
00:16:17,154 --> 00:16:20,851
-So, what are you watching?
-Baywatch.

261
00:16:22,927 --> 00:16:24,622
What's it about?

262
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:27,630
Lifeguards.

263
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:30,960
Well, it sounds kind of stup--

264
00:16:31,502 --> 00:16:32,491
Who's she?

265
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:35,267
Nicole Eggert.

266
00:16:35,873 --> 00:16:37,363
We like her.

267
00:16:43,347 --> 00:16:45,076
Wow! Look at them run!

268
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:48,852
They do that a lot.

269
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:53,220
Hey, you want a beer?

270
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:56,690
-Yeah, l'll go get one.
-Don't get up. l got a cooler right here.

271
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,798
-Hello!
-Hey.

272
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:05,501
Do you have any beers?
We're out of beers.

273
00:17:05,703 --> 00:17:07,637
Help yourself.

274
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:09,570
You okay?

275
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:13,609
Phoebe moved out.

276
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:17,637
Right.

277
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:19,849
l don't understand.

278
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:24,680
Am l so hard to live with?
ls this why l don't have a boyfriend?

279
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:25,981
No!

280
00:17:26,157 --> 00:17:29,285
You don't have a boyfriend because....

281
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:33,758
l don't know why
you don't have a boyfriend.

282
00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:36,463
You should have a boyfriend.

283
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:39,494
Well, l think so.

284
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:42,329
Come here.

285
00:17:42,573 --> 00:17:43,597
Come here.

286
00:17:46,243 --> 00:17:49,474
Listen, you are one
of my favorite people...

287
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,844
...and the most beautiful woman
l've ever known in real life.

288
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:09,663
Hi.

289
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:13,030
Where is everybody?

290
00:18:13,204 --> 00:18:17,300
Oh, it's already closed. Chris gave me
the keys to lock up. What is wrong?

291
00:18:17,508 --> 00:18:20,671
l think my marriage...

292
00:18:20,845 --> 00:18:22,039
...is kind of over.

293
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:24,343
Oh, no! Why?

294
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:26,710
Because Carol's a lesbian.

295
00:18:30,054 --> 00:18:31,043
And....

296
00:18:31,222 --> 00:18:32,746
And l'm not one.

297
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:39,696
And apparently it's not
a mix-and-match situation.

298
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:41,924
Oh, my God!

299
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,824
l don't believe it!

300
00:18:45,936 --> 00:18:47,836
Oh, you poor bunny.

301
00:18:49,573 --> 00:18:50,733
l'm an idiot.

302
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:53,542
l mean, l should have seen it.

303
00:18:53,711 --> 00:18:58,910
l mean, Carol and l would be out,
and she'd see some beautiful woman...

304
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:02,143
...and she'd be, ''Ross! Look at her!''

305
00:19:02,353 --> 00:19:07,313
And l'd think, ''God, my wife is cool.''

306
00:19:13,864 --> 00:19:16,298
Hey, do you think
that Susan person is her lover?

307
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,861
Well, now l do!

308
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:25,609
l'm sorry.

309
00:19:27,311 --> 00:19:29,609
Seven years!

310
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,977
l mean, we've been together
seven years.

311
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:36,280
She's the only woman
who's ever loved me.

312
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:39,114
She's the only woman l've ever....

313
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,584
Oh, Ross.

314
00:19:46,263 --> 00:19:47,855
This is nice.

315
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:49,760
l know. lt is, isn't it?

316
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:55,562
No, l mean it.
This feels really good.

317
00:19:56,874 --> 00:19:59,536
ls it a hundred percent cotton?

318
00:20:03,013 --> 00:20:06,107
Yeah.
And l got it on sale too.

319
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,180
l mean, it looks nubby, but....

320
00:20:09,353 --> 00:20:11,878
But it's not.

321
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:14,113
Anyway, l should go.

322
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:18,523
One of the lifeguards was just about
to dismantle a nuclear device.

323
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,698
lf you want to get
a drink later, we can.

324
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:23,356
That sounds great.

325
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:28,162
-Oh, and listen, it's gonna be--
-l know.

326
00:20:28,372 --> 00:20:29,498
Thanks.

327
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:38,147
Maybe this wouldn't have happened
if l'd been more nurturing...

328
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:42,046
...or l'd paid more attention...

329
00:20:42,219 --> 00:20:44,813
...or l had a uterus.

330
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:47,720
-l can't believe it.
-l know.

331
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:51,291
You know, you don't deserve this.
You don't, Ross. You're really....

332
00:20:51,495 --> 00:20:53,258
-You're so good.
-Thanks.

333
00:20:53,497 --> 00:20:55,226
And you're so sweet.

334
00:20:55,432 --> 00:20:57,923
-Thanks.
-And you're kind.

335
00:20:58,135 --> 00:20:59,397
Thanks.

336
00:21:10,748 --> 00:21:12,579
Come here.

337
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:15,144
Wait, wait, wait.

338
00:21:20,024 --> 00:21:22,015
Okay. lt's okay.

339
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:30,426
Wait, wait, wait!
My foot is stuck in the pocket.

340
00:21:30,601 --> 00:21:32,364
What?

341
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:34,401
-What?
-l can't get it out.

342
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:37,370
That's not something
a girl wants to hear.

343
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,009
Come on, don't start.

344
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:45,070
-What?
-Stupid balls are in the way.

345
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:04,392
Oh, well.

346
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:10,106
That probably wouldn't have been
