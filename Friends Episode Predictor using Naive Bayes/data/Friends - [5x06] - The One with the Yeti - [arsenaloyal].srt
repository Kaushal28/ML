1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,975
None of that.
Not while you're under my roof!

2
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:16,205
Just because I know about you
doesn't mean I like looking at it.

3
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,181
Aren't you supposed to be
at an audition?

4
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:22,321
I'm sorry I'm not
a middle-aged black woman.

5
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:28,157
I'm also sorry if sometimes
I go to the wrong audition.

6
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,229
If I pretend to not know about you...

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,025
...then you pretend
there's nothing to know.

8
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,659
Sorry.

9
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,478
I can hear that!

10
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,815
Rachel's at work.

11
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,547
I can still hear you!

12
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,190
The One With the Yeti

13
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,333
What's that?

14
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:53,410
My mom sent me an heirloom
that belonged to my grandmother.

15
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,569
Can you believe it?

16
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,877
A year ago I had no family,
and now I have heirlooms!

17
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,712
The only heirloom I ever got
was a feather boa.

18
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:06,086
Got if from my dad.
He got it from his dad.

19
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,654
How did I ever get born?

20
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,328
Oh, God!

21
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,842
Soft.

22
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,410
Is this mink?

23
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:32,750
Why would my mother send me a fur?
Doesn't she know me but at all?

24
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:37,753
I have a fine coat that no innocent
animals suffered to make.

25
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:41,118
Just Filipino kids who worked
their fingers bloody...

26
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,726
...for 12 cents an hour.

27
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,222
I made that up.

28
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,866
You can't put up flyers in here.

29
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,072
How come?
Everybody else does.

30
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,477
You can't.

31
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,612
What is that?

32
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,715
I'm getting rid of some things.

33
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,921
This is all of your things.

34
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,982
Yes, it is.

35
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,052
It's good. Emily thinks
we should get all new stuff.

36
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,266
Stuff that's just ours.
Together. Brand new.

37
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,435
So it's a get-rid-of-anything-
Rachel-ever-touched sale.

38
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,430
Touched, used, sat on, slept on....

39
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,431
I'll take it all.

40
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,642
You're okay with that?

41
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,742
If I can just do what Emily wants...

42
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,744
...and get her to New York,
it will be fine.

43
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,974
Isn't that a little extreme?

44
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,187
After what I did, can you blame her?

45
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,444
You got off easy.

46
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,421
When my friend's husband said
another name in bed...

47
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,992
...she cursed him
and turned his thingy green.

48
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,497
I guess I'm lucky Emily is not magic.

49
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,493
Oh, she is.

50
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,433
We all are.

51
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,242
What is he doing?

52
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:12,645
Emily thinks Ross' furniture
has got Rachel cooties?

53
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,815
Calm down, Joey.

54
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,113
Everything's getting all messed up!

55
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,984
Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.

56
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,986
We won't stop seeing Rachel.

57
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:24,128
Hence, Ross stops seeing us.

58
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,623
I hate this.
Everything's changing.

59
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,595
We're losing Ross.
Joey said "hence."

60
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:38,233
I'm not happy about this either,
but if Ross says he's happy...

61
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,447
...then we have to keep
our feelings to ourselves.

62
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,979
Are you cool with that?

63
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,584
But, you know, I'm an actor.

64
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,415
I'll act cool.

65
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:55,690
Probably be some of the hardest acting
I've ever done.

66
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,760
Maybe I'll play it with a mustache.

67
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,830
Storage rooms give me the creeps.

68
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,340
Please hurry up, honey.

69
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,344
If you want little round waffles,
wait till I find the iron.

70
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,376
I want the little round waffles.

71
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,276
Here it is!

72
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,084
Right underneath the can of bug bomb.

73
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,784
Is the best place to put something
that cooks food underneath poison?

74
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,788
You know what?
I'll have toast.

75
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,928
Fog him! Fog him!

76
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,573
I don't know what to do
about this coat.

77
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,270
I'll take it.

78
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,383
That might work.

79
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,284
What do you think?

80
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,754
You're on in five, Ms. Minnelli.

81
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,990
No, it's just a bit sudden.

82
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,134
It's great, okay?
I am totally onboard.

83
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,503
I love you too.
All right, bye.

84
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,303
What's the matter?

85
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,909
Nothing. No, actually...

86
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,840
...great news!

87
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,106
I just spoke with Emily...

88
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,411
...and looks like I'm moving
to a new apartment.

89
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:30,945
Why?

90
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,885
Her thought is, and I agree...

91
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:38,391
...fresh new furniture,
why not a fresh new apartment?

92
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,463
Her cousin has a place to sublet.

93
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,464
It's got a view
of the river and Columbia.

94
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,934
That's way uptown!
That's three trains away...

95
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,572
...which is great!

96
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,070
I love to ride that rail.

97
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,440
You're okay with this?

98
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,341
It's kind of far from work...

99
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,813
...but I'll get so much done
on the commute.

100
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,687
I've been given the gift of time.

101
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,817
That's so funny. Last Christmas
I got the gift of space.

102
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,924
We should get them together
and make a continuum.

103
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,430
Now he's moving?

104
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,537
Man, what is Emily doing to him?

105
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,770
He's not even here!

106
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,637
You guys!

107
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:30,709
We were in the storage area,
and we saw this creepy man.

108
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:34,146
It was this crazy-eyed,
hairy beast-man.

109
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,288
It was like a Big Foot
or a yeti or something.

110
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,620
He came at us,
so Rachel used a bug bomb on him.

111
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:45,195
I pulled the tab
and I just fogged his yeti ass.

112
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,657
Like, dark hair, bushy beard?

113
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,363
Yeah, you fogged Danny.

114
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,867
Please! We did not fog Danny.

115
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,475
Who's Danny?

116
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,574
Danny just moved in.

117
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:05,409
He just got back from a four-month
trek in the Andes. Nice fella.

118
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,548
He's nice.
You know, you always...

119
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,850
...stick up for the people we fog.

120
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:27,501
You might not remember us,
but we're the girls that fogged you.

121
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,400
We're really sorry we fogged you.

122
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,909
Just so you know,
we didn't mean to fog you.

123
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:45,349
We thought you were
like a yeti or something.

124
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:58,801
Sorry to bother you, but we can't
accept your acceptance of our apology.

125
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,768
It doesn't really seem
like you mean it.

126
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:09,876
That guy is so rude!

127
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,414
Really!
What is with that guy?

128
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,980
You'd forgive me if I fogged you.

129
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,086
You did, a little bit.

130
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,792
Oh, my God, honey.
I'm so sorry.

131
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,285
-I totally forgive you.
-Really?

132
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,502
You know my friend Chris
who owns the crematorium?

133
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,105
Crematorium Chris? Sure.

134
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,506
He said he would cremate
my fur coat for free...

135
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,238
...if I bring in the next person
I know who dies.

136
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,478
Oh, my God!

137
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,953
Oh, my God.
Look at these pelts!

138
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,161
Don't get too attached.
She's having it cremated.

139
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,633
You're quirky, and I get a big kick
out of it. We all do.

140
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:06,134
But if you destroy
a coat like this...

141
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,502
...that is like a crime
against nature.

142
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,171
Not nature. Fashion!

143
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,044
This is fashion?

144
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,745
So to you, death is fashion?

145
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,041
That's funny.

146
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,114
Here's Phoebe...

147
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:24,219
...sporting cutting-edge
hairy carcass...

148
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:28,826
...from, you know, the steel traps
of wintry Russia.

149
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,090
You really think this looks good?

150
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,395
Because I do!

151
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,370
I miss you too.
I can't wait to see you.

152
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,100
I love you. Bye.

153
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,305
What is in here, rocks?

154
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,848
No, it's my collection
of fossil samples.

155
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,911
So, rocks.

156
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,326
I'll miss this apartment.

157
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,630
You know, Ben took his first steps
right over there.

158
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:13,331
Remember when I ran into this
and it knocked me out?

159
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,665
I love this place.

160
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,876
To tell the truth,
I wish I didn't have to move.

161
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,274
Are you saying that you're not
entirely happy about this?

162
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,975
If Emily gave me a choice

163
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,280
You do have a choice!

164
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,951
Why are you listening to her?
Are you crazy?

165
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,358
It's not right what Emily wants
you to do. She's totally

166
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,694
Stop pinching me!

167
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:46,568
You guys said to keep my mouth shut
if Ross was happy, right?

168
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,909
He just told me
that he's not entirely happy.

169
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,068
What's going on?

170
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:55,973
We all hate Emily!

171
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,649
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily.

172
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,888
We just think that
you're having to sacrifice...

173
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,057
...a whole lot to make her happy.

174
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:13,357
We just think that maybe
she's being a little unreasonable.

175
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,533
Yes, unreasonable.

176
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,832
Unreasonable?

177
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:21,600
How about we have this conversation
when one of you marries?

178
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:25,774
You have no idea what it takes
to make a marriage work.

179
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,605
It's compromise.
Do you always like it? No.

180
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:29,905
Do you do it? Yes.

181
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,449
Because it's not all laughing,
happy, candy in the sky...

182
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,244
...coffee at Central Perk.

183
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,920
It's real life, okay?

184
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,351
It's what grownups do.

185
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,127
I think he's right.

186
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,862
You guys hang out at
the coffeehouse way too much.

187
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,545
-I feel so guilty about Ross.
-I know.

188
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,412
I kind of feel like it's my fault.

189
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,382
Kind of?

190
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,613
You should have kept this to yourself.

191
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,927
I'm keeping so many things to myself,
something was bound to slip out!

192
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,887
I think it's very brave
what you said.

193
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,798
I can't sit here anymore.
I have to walk places.

194
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,233
What's with the coat?
How about the animal rights thing?

195
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,100
I've been reading up,
and for your information...

196
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,176
...minks aren't very nice.

197
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:42,379
-So they deserve to be killed?
-Well, they are real bad.

198
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,885
Okay, I admit it.
I love this coat, okay?

199
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:51,495
It's the best thing I ever had wrapped
around me, including Phil Huntley.

200
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,393
Remember Phil Huntley?
He was fine.

201
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,142
So you like the short hair better?

202
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,116
Yeti? Danny?

203
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,686
I had to cut my hair to get rid of...

204
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,595
...the fogger smell.

205
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:29,260
Listen, I'm so sorry.
I would have never fogged you...

206
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,868
...if you hadn't looked so....

207
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,775
Absolutely. Some people
are just into appearances.

208
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,165
What?

209
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,466
It's cool.

210
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,309
No, that is not cool.

211
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,981
You don't even know me.

212
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,151
You got the shopping bags
and the Saks catalog.

213
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:51,315
From that, you've got me
all figured out?

214
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,018
Well, you don't.

215
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:57,525
You know, I could have toys
for underprivileged kids in here.

216
00:14:58,497 --> 00:14:59,623
Do you?

217
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,560
You know, if kids like to play
with capri pants.

218
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,299
Stop saying that.
I hate that!

219
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,556
I judged you.
I made a snap judgment.

220
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:29,023
But you did it too, and you're worse.
You're sticking to your judgment.

221
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,662
You can't even open your mind to see
you might be wrong.

222
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,355
What does that say about you?

223
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,028
That pizza place
across the street any good?

224
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,172
I'm hungry.
You want some pizza?

225
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:42,840
You can keep yelling.

226
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,437
Stop saying that.
I hate that.

227
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,545
Are you still mad?

228
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,258
Good! We have an "I'm Sorry" song.

229
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,517
You know what?
I'm not in the mood.

230
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,121
Look, Ross.

231
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:10,095
I feel really bad.
You're going through all this stuff...

232
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,463
...and I just acted like a jerk.

233
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:16,607
-We are so sorry.
-You're stepping on the song.

234
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,373
We were way out of line, all right?
We totally support you.

235
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,638
Whatever you decide,
whatever you do.

236
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,949
Now you're just taking lines
out of the song.

237
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:32,049
This is hard enough, okay?
I really need you guys right now.

238
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,385
Yes, exactly! And that's why....

239
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:41,156
Why don't you come over tonight,
and I'll make your favorite dinner.

240
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,434
Thanks, you guys.

241
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,562
Are you wearing fur?

242
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,799
Let's get some perspective, people.

243
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,309
It's not like I'm wearing
a seeing-eye dog coat!

244
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:02,679
You know, I think I kind of
understand why I lost it today.

245
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:04,679
You do, huh?

246
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:05,912
You see...

247
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,854
...I'm an actor, right?

248
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,091
So I got to keep my emotions
right at the surface.

249
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,656
I got a lot of balls in the air,
you know?

250
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:22,499
It's tough. Guys like me,
you wander around, you're alone.

251
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,971
What are you talking about?

252
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,939
I'm not sure.

253
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,011
Look at you!
Where have you been?

254
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,946
I went to have pizza.

255
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,644
With Danny.

256
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:41,016
-What happened?
-That yeti is one smooth talker.

257
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,629
Yetis are smooth-talkers. That's why
you never see any pictures of them.

258
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,664
"Come here, baby. Give me the camera."

259
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,799
I hope you're not full.
Dinner's almost ready.

260
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:55,132
I think I'll probably
just hang out in my room.

261
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,329
Why?

262
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,734
Come on, you guys!

263
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:02,045
If Emily knew I was having dinner
with you, she'd flip out.

264
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,046
It's okay.
I really don't mind.

265
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,152
Wait, wait. You know what?
Just stay.

266
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,050
Please.

267
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,924
It would mean a lot for me
if you stay.

268
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,484
Ross, I just

269
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:21,187
Please, just have dinner with us!

270
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,359
Settle down.

271
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,038
All right. I'm sorry.

272
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,331
You see, Rach, I'm an actor.

273
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,911
Hey, look!
Ugly Naked Guy's back.

274
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,046
We haven't seen him in so long.

275
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,744
Oh, God! I really missed
that fat bastard.

276
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,191
This is so weird.

277
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:54,126
I realized this may be
the last time we hang out together.

278
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,102
It's almost as if he knew.

279
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,271
I'll get it.

280
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,711
Hi, Emily.

281
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,772
You tracked him down.
Hold on.

282
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,817
Yeah, we're just having dinner.

283
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,917
Sure, hold on.

284
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,651
She wants to say hi.

285
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,125
Hi, Emily!

286
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,833
Hello, everyone.

287
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,127
So who am I saying hello to?

288
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:35,168
Well, I don't know
about who's here...

289
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:39,104
...but I can tell you who's not here,
and that's Rachel!

290
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,241
I should hope not.
Ross knows better than that by now.

291
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,313
You know what?
Rachel is here.

292
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,248
She's there?

293
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,483
Oh, yeah, there she is!

294
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,130
She's here.

295
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,127
Take me off speakerphone.

296
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,293
How could you do this to me?

297
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,805
I made my feelings about Rachel
perfectly clear.

298
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:13,034
I'm just having dinner
with my friends, okay?

299
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,542
-You can't keep away from her.
-That's ridiculous.

300
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,950
-Hello? Hello?
-Who is this?

301
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,720
It's Ross. What are you doing?

302
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,256
Sorry, dude, I had to make a call.

303
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,255
Joey.

304
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,961
Joey, they don't have two lines,
they have two phones.

305
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,303
Gotcha.

306
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,903
I'm sorry. Emily, listen.
I have never cheated on you.

307
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,244
I'm moving for you. I'm cutting
friends out of my life for you.

308
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:56,783
Please, get on the plane
and come to New York, okay?

309
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,421
You're the only one
I want to be with.

310
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:03,889
I'll feel better when I'm there.
I can know where you are all the time.

311
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,930
You can't know where I am
all the time.

312
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:15,398
This marriage will never work
if you don't trust me.

313
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,602
You're right.

314
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,642
Can you trust me?

315
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,055
I think it's going okay.

316
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,056
Looks like he's smiling.

317
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,129
How can you tell?
You can only see his back.

318
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,557
You can totally tell!

319
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,435
Here, look, watch me.

320
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,559
Smile.

321
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,296
Frown. Smile.

322
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,933
Frown.

323
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,234
Smile.

324
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,623
I guess that's it.

325
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,093
Why? What happened?

326
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,826
My marriage is over.

327
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,024
Look at you, you're shivering.

328
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,334
Here.

329
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,769
Honey, is there anything we can do?

330
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:33,482
You can help me
get my furniture back from Gunther.

331
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,270
Stop tormenting me!

332
00:22:56,808 --> 00:23:00,972
This is mink, okay? They're mean,
and they hate squirrels.

333
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:04,238
Most of these probably
wanted to be coats.

334
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,314
Fine. No, I get it.

335
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,542
Here.

336
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,211
You take it.

337
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,554
Are you happy now?
I'm cold!
