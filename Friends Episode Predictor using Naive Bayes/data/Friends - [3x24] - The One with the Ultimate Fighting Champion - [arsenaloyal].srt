1
00:00:02,314 --> 00:00:05,715
Do you think there's a town
in Missouri or someplace...

2
00:00:05,951 --> 00:00:07,384
...called Sample?

3
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:11,488
And as you're driving into the town,
there's a sign and it says:

4
00:00:11,757 --> 00:00:13,816
''You're in Sample.''

5
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:20,054
-How did it go with Pete?
-Tell us.

6
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:22,563
You're not gonna believe this.
So l go--

7
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:24,792
l'm sorry. Excuse us.

8
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:31,042
-lt's a little crowded. Do you mind?
-Could you scooch?

9
00:00:31,443 --> 00:00:33,070
Move over just a little bit.

10
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:35,810
Keep on scooching.

11
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:40,876
So, guys, listen.
l go over there and, you know, l'm--

12
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:43,111
Why? What is wrong with me?

13
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:45,153
-What's the matter?
-Tim...

14
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:47,153
...l have a feeling...

15
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,125
...my wife is sleeping
with her gynecologist.

16
00:00:53,932 --> 00:00:55,229
How do you know?

17
00:00:55,434 --> 00:00:56,958
-He's got access.
-l know.

18
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:00,527
lt's a feeling you get.

19
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:03,103
Like when you're in
somebody else's bowling shoes?

20
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:04,741
That's the one.

21
00:01:05,877 --> 00:01:08,277
-So you went to Pete's.
-What happened?

22
00:01:08,513 --> 00:01:10,879
Why is this happening to me?

23
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,641
Maybe it's my wound.

24
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:14,813
Forget it.

25
00:01:15,887 --> 00:01:17,320
lt's not healed yet?

26
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:18,922
lt's oozing!

27
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:21,858
Would you pass the cream?
There's the cream.

28
00:01:22,094 --> 00:01:23,527
Thank you very much.

29
00:01:24,563 --> 00:01:28,499
Tomas, this is gonna be hard,
but l wanted it to come from me.

30
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:31,464
-What is it?
-l've been sleeping with your wife.

31
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,728
You're the gynecologist?

32
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:35,667
l'm trying to have
a private conversation.

33
00:01:37,442 --> 00:01:40,343
Can l have a napkin?
Could you please hand me a napkin?

34
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:42,911
Just give me the thing, all right?

35
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:47,874
Enough!
And you are no longer my friend!

36
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:50,077
We are finished! Nada!
No more!

37
00:01:50,355 --> 00:01:52,289
You are a bastard for doing that!

38
00:01:52,557 --> 00:01:54,024
Stay away from me!

39
00:01:54,793 --> 00:01:55,851
Come back!

40
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:07,067
So, what were you gonna tell us?

41
00:02:08,073 --> 00:02:09,404
l have no idea.

42
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:17,938
The One With the Ultimate Fighting Champion

43
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,857
What was the big news
Pete wanted to tell you?

44
00:03:02,027 --> 00:03:04,257
Or should l say, ''Mrs. Monica Becker''?

45
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,362
Oh, keep your name.
Don't take his name.

46
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:09,758
He didn't ask me to marry him.

47
00:03:09,968 --> 00:03:12,402
Then definitely don't take his name!

48
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:17,363
He wanted to tell me he's going
to compete in some Ultimate...

49
00:03:17,576 --> 00:03:19,373
...Fighting Competition thingy.

50
00:03:19,578 --> 00:03:21,944
-Pete?
-Why? What is it?

51
00:03:22,214 --> 00:03:24,774
l don't know exactly.
lt's sort of like wrestling.

52
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,983
But without the costumes.

53
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:31,414
And it's not fake.
lt's totally brutal.

54
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:35,921
lt's two guys in the ring and
the rules are, ''There are no rules'' !

55
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:41,056
-l heard you made a great 1 2-year-old.
-lt was the best year of my life.

56
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,758
You can bite and pull
people's hair and stuff?

57
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:47,266
Anything goes except eye-gouging
and fish-hooking.

58
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:49,939
-What's fish-hooking?
-What's fish-hook--?

59
00:03:52,577 --> 00:03:55,546
Thanks. That would have been
hard to describe.

60
00:03:55,914 --> 00:03:57,404
What is that taste?

61
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:01,643
My hands are totally clean.
l just gave the duck a bath.

62
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:07,047
Thanks for the warm welcome.

63
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:11,762
lt's good to have you guys on my team.
l come to play. l hope you do too.

64
00:04:11,963 --> 00:04:14,431
Let's go out there and get them!
And remember:

65
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,226
There is no l in ''team.''

66
00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:21,462
Yes, but there's two in ''martini.''
So, everybody, back to my office.

67
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:25,307
You! Chuckles. What's your name?

68
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:27,636
lt's Bing, sir.
l'm sorry. l was just....

69
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:31,280
No, no. l heard what you said.
Funny. l like funny.

70
00:04:31,616 --> 00:04:34,449
This team's about hard work,
but it's also about having fun.

71
00:04:34,686 --> 00:04:36,677
Good to have you aboard, Bing!

72
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:45,419
That's right. Ryder.

73
00:04:46,164 --> 00:04:48,496
Winona Ryder for six.

74
00:04:51,036 --> 00:04:52,025
Thank you.

75
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:54,604
Yeah. We have the reservations.

76
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,331
All right, buddy! Way to go!

77
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:01,376
Dude, what are you doing?

78
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:06,450
Thank you. My boss keeps slapping my
butt and acting like it's no big deal.

79
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:08,175
What'd you do about it?

80
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:11,184
l didn't do anything.
l didn't want to be the guy...

81
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:14,290
...who has a problem with his boss
slapping his bottom.

82
00:05:15,126 --> 00:05:18,459
l gotta tell you, l think it's okay
to be that guy.

83
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:20,897
Maybe it's that jock thing.

84
00:05:21,132 --> 00:05:24,863
You know, how football players
pat each other after touchdowns.

85
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:29,299
You know, l don't understand guys.

86
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:33,010
l mean, l would never congratulate
Monica on a great stew...

87
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:35,475
...by, you know, grabbing her boob.

88
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:39,510
l know. For a really great stew,
you'd just...

89
00:05:39,751 --> 00:05:41,548
...stick your head in between them.

90
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:44,688
Can we please go eat?

91
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:48,017
-Yeah, what are we getting?
-Anything but stew.

92
00:05:49,027 --> 00:05:52,519
So from now on, don't give
your boss a chance to get you.

93
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:54,493
Don't turn your back to him.

94
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,660
Or you could teach him
a lesson, you know?

95
00:05:57,903 --> 00:06:02,499
What you do is rub something that
smells really bad on your butt, right?

96
00:06:02,707 --> 00:06:06,074
Then, when he goes to smack you,
his hand will smell.

97
00:06:08,914 --> 00:06:12,543
Now, what could you rub on your butt
that would smell bad?

98
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,511
What if Joey was president?

99
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,290
Can l ask you something?

100
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:24,756
Okay, you can totally say no...

101
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,057
...but would it be okay with you
if l set Ross up on a date?

102
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:32,100
With who?

103
00:06:32,404 --> 00:06:35,202
My friend Bonnie.
She always thought Ross was cute...

104
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,068
...and she asked if l could set it up.

105
00:06:38,276 --> 00:06:41,040
-But if that's not cool....
-Which one is Bonnie?

106
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:43,737
You remember her from
my birthday party?

107
00:06:43,982 --> 00:06:46,109
Average height...

108
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:48,548
...medium build, bald....

109
00:06:52,424 --> 00:06:54,483
That's fine.

110
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:58,857
-Really?
-Ross and the bald girl? Absolutely.

111
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,329
Great! Okay! Good for you!
All right!

112
00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:10,806
You are iron! You are steel!

113
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:15,070
Let me ask you, how come when l call
your computer support line...

114
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,339
...l have to wait an hour and a half?

115
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:21,107
We're adding operators all the time.
Could we concentrate on my training?

116
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:24,755
lt's just hard when l know
l have e-mail l can't get.

117
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:30,050
-Hi.
-Monica.

118
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:34,128
-Hi, honey.
-On the table. On the table, please.

119
00:07:37,702 --> 00:07:40,933
So listen, my friends were
telling me a little bit about...

120
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:42,868
...this Ultimate Fighting thing.

121
00:07:43,174 --> 00:07:45,142
lt sounds really dangerous.

122
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:48,403
l don't want you to get hurt
because l kind of like you.

123
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,107
l don't want to get hurt either.
l'm being smart about this.

124
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,376
See these guys? They're
the best trainers in the world.

125
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,487
And Hoshi here used to be
a paid assassin.

126
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,752
A house painter!
He used to be a house painter!

127
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:07,126
-Promise me you'll be careful.
-l promise.

128
00:08:07,298 --> 00:08:10,392
Are we still on for tonight?
Good. Because...

129
00:08:10,635 --> 00:08:13,365
...maybe we could have
a little workout of our own.

130
00:08:13,638 --> 00:08:15,265
No boom-boom before big fight!

131
00:08:20,378 --> 00:08:21,675
How about just a boom?

132
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:28,682
That was depressing.
l just bought a pretzel...

133
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:30,980
...from one of the kids from Fame.

134
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,791
Ready to go to the movies?
Oh, this is Bonnie!

135
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,084
Hi!

136
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:38,355
This is Bonnie?

137
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:40,496
This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?

138
00:08:40,665 --> 00:08:43,634
l can show you an lD. if you want.

139
00:08:43,802 --> 00:08:47,898
Oh, no. You look a lot different
than the last time l saw you.

140
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:51,008
Oh, yeah. Well, l just
started wearing bras again.

141
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:53,605
Oh, that must be it.

142
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,340
Have fun tonight.

143
00:08:56,514 --> 00:08:57,742
Thanks. You too.

144
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:05,851
You said she was bald.

145
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:07,854
She was bald. She's not now.

146
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:11,792
How could you not tell me
she has hair?

147
00:09:11,963 --> 00:09:14,955
l don't know.
l hardly ever say that about people.

148
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:16,996
Oh, well, this is just perfect!

149
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:20,636
Well, l'm sorry.
l thought you said it was okay.

150
00:09:20,805 --> 00:09:25,401
l said it was okay when l thought
she was some weird bald chick.

151
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,078
That girl has got hair
all over her head!

152
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:34,711
-Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
-Does she have a bad personality?

153
00:09:34,886 --> 00:09:37,116
Oh, no, Bonnie's the best!

154
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,387
Bing!

155
00:09:45,897 --> 00:09:48,798
Read your CompuTek proposal.
Real home run.

156
00:09:50,235 --> 00:09:52,965
Barely got you that time.
Get over here!

157
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:55,133
Come on.

158
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,864
Oh, yeah! Good one.

159
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,669
That was a good one.
Keep at it, team!

160
00:10:01,312 --> 00:10:02,973
-What is with him?
-''With him''?

161
00:10:03,248 --> 00:10:05,648
You're his favorite.
You're his guy!

162
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,215
We never get smacked.

163
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,888
That's not true.
He smacked you once.

164
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:14,320
Not on purpose.
He ricocheted off you and got me.

165
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:17,651
l'm telling you,
l need some smacks.

166
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:20,059
l got a kid starting Dartmouth.

167
00:10:20,365 --> 00:10:23,198
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth?
Dartmouth sucks!

168
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:24,867
-You go to Dartmouth?
-No, sir.

169
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,660
There you go!

170
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:36,670
God, Ross! What is that?

171
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:38,611
The Ultimate Fighting Combo.

172
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:41,944
l saved 30 cents.
Plus, l get to keep the cup.

173
00:10:44,122 --> 00:10:46,556
From New York City, New York...

174
00:10:46,824 --> 00:10:50,920
...appearing in his Ultimate
Fighting Championship debut...

175
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:54,861
...he's known for his
confrontational business style!

176
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:59,570
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing...

177
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:02,204
...Pete Becker!

178
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:09,378
l love you, Pete!

179
00:11:13,251 --> 00:11:17,415
And his opponent,
from Huntington Beach, California...

180
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:21,491
...he's a 300-pound
street fighter...

181
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:24,291
...Tank Abbott!

182
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:39,175
Pete? Pete?

183
00:11:39,577 --> 00:11:41,772
-That guy's pretty huge.
-Don't worry.

184
00:11:42,046 --> 00:11:44,514
l'll use his strength
and weight against him.

185
00:11:44,782 --> 00:11:48,878
Well, then that guy is in serious,
serious trouble.

186
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,786
You go get him. Let's go!

187
00:11:57,262 --> 00:11:58,923
Here we go, gentlemen.

188
00:11:59,197 --> 00:12:00,459
Are you ready?

189
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:06,195
Are you ready?
Then let's get it on!

190
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,322
lt's me.

191
00:12:30,561 --> 00:12:32,256
Monica.

192
00:12:34,632 --> 00:12:35,758
Who else would it be?

193
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:39,596
Earlier, when you were coming to,
you called me Fran.

194
00:12:41,706 --> 00:12:44,436
Can l just tell you how proud
l am of you?

195
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:48,636
lt would be nice after hearing
20,000 people chant, ''You suck!''

196
00:12:49,747 --> 00:12:51,738
l thought you were nuts at first...

197
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:53,541
...but you did it.

198
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:57,114
Now you can just look back at this
with no regrets.

199
00:12:57,288 --> 00:12:58,755
Look back?

200
00:12:59,424 --> 00:13:01,415
You're not gonna keep going?

201
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:05,527
Let me ask you a question:
Am l the Ultimate Fighting Champion?

202
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:09,329
Well, no. But--

203
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,867
l'm not gonna stop until l'm
the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

204
00:13:13,805 --> 00:13:17,741
That guy stood on your neck
until you passed out.

205
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:20,104
Let me tell you a story.

206
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:25,312
When l set out to create MOSS 865,
do you think it happened overnight?

207
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:29,986
No. There was MOSS 1
that burned down my dad's garage.

208
00:13:30,254 --> 00:13:34,156
There was MOSS 2 that would only
schedule appointments in January.

209
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:36,759
And 862 others that l learned from.

210
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:40,897
Just like l learned from this fight,
never to let a guy stand on my neck.

211
00:13:41,065 --> 00:13:43,192
You didn't know that already?

212
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:46,863
Look, l'm gonna get better.

213
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:49,631
Okay? l promise you.

214
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:55,710
Just get a lot better.

215
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:57,705
Fast.

216
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:00,775
One other thing.

217
00:14:01,018 --> 00:14:04,852
Hoshi thinks you being ringside
may have affected my concentration.

218
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,014
Yeah.

219
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:09,489
That was the problem.

220
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:18,233
-How long until Pete's fight?
-About five minutes.

221
00:14:18,503 --> 00:14:20,334
They're interviewing his opponent.

222
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:24,498
Apparently, he trains by going to lran
and pulling the arms off thieves.

223
00:14:25,877 --> 00:14:28,175
-Hot dog?
-Four, please.

224
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:30,238
l'm really nervous.

225
00:14:31,182 --> 00:14:32,240
Thank you.

226
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:37,782
So, Ross, how did it go with Bonnie?

227
00:14:37,955 --> 00:14:42,085
Oh, l gotta tell you,
l wasn't expecting to like her at all.

228
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,261
l actually wasn't expecting
to like anyone right now.

229
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,555
But she's really terrific.

230
00:14:47,732 --> 00:14:49,723
lt's too bad.

231
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:53,796
No, l'm saying l liked her.

232
00:14:53,971 --> 00:14:55,905
There are other fish in the sea.

233
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:00,408
l think she's great, okay?
We're going out again.

234
00:15:00,912 --> 00:15:05,281
l hear you. Are you capable
of talking about anything else?

235
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,941
Which one's my turkey burger?

236
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:10,447
The one next to my foot.
Sorry.

237
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:13,686
-Fight's starting!
-We'll be right in.

238
00:15:13,891 --> 00:15:16,883
So did your boss try
to slap you again today?

239
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:19,154
Nine times.

240
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:21,024
l had to put on lotion.

241
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,967
But it'll be okay.
Tomorrow, l conduct an experiment.

242
00:15:26,237 --> 00:15:30,196
And if all goes as planned,
my butt will be smack-free.

243
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,069
Fight's over!

244
00:15:37,682 --> 00:15:39,081
Excuse me, Doug?

245
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:43,543
Hey there, sports fan!

246
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:46,389
Bing! You got those numbers for me?

247
00:15:46,591 --> 00:15:48,684
No. l didn't do them.

248
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,623
You forgot?

249
00:15:50,928 --> 00:15:53,556
No, l just didn't do them.

250
00:15:53,731 --> 00:15:57,292
lnstead, l hung out with some
friends and had a couple of beers.

251
00:15:57,568 --> 00:16:00,230
So l certainly don't
deserve praise. Verbal...

252
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:02,063
...or otherwise.

253
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:05,801
l got tanked myself last night.
Pretty dicey drive home.

254
00:16:06,043 --> 00:16:08,477
Tappan Zee Bridge never looked smaller.

255
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:12,710
That's okay. You're still
my number-one guy! Bing!

256
00:16:13,317 --> 00:16:14,909
Doug!

257
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:20,280
l'm a little bit uncomfortable with
the way that you express yourself.

258
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:23,051
ls it the swearing?
ls it the constant swearing?

259
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:27,254
Because l gotta tell you, if it is,
you can just kiss my ass!

260
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,063
lt's not about the swearing.
lt's more about...

261
00:16:32,303 --> 00:16:34,794
...the way that you occasionally...

262
00:16:35,072 --> 00:16:38,508
...concentrate your enthusiasm...

263
00:16:39,777 --> 00:16:41,472
...on my buttocks.

264
00:16:43,781 --> 00:16:46,682
Don't get me wrong.
l appreciate the sentiment.

265
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:50,877
lt's just that l have a rather
sensitive posterior.

266
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,887
And besides, it's making
all the other guys jealous.

267
00:16:56,093 --> 00:17:00,257
Well, say no more. You know,
it takes guts to bring this up.

268
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:02,296
Bing, you're okay.

269
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,137
Would you rather live in the
shirt pocket of a sweaty giant...

270
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,871
...or inside his shower drain?

271
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:22,146
Oh, my God.

272
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,779
Look. lt's Ross and that girl.

273
00:17:28,225 --> 00:17:32,787
Look at that! lt's a line of ants!
They're working as a team!

274
00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:38,728
Right. Oh, yeah. lt looks
like Ross is breaking up with her.

275
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:40,470
l hope he lets her down easy.

276
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:43,697
Look at that! They are not
breaking up! Look at them!

277
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:47,068
You know what that is?
A second date, that's what that is.

278
00:17:47,578 --> 00:17:50,069
Look, she just put her hand
on his thigh.

279
00:17:50,247 --> 00:17:52,875
That's nothing.
She's very sexually aggressive.

280
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,244
Oh, God!

281
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:59,048
lt's your fault. Now he loves her.
He'll marry her. lt's all your fault.

282
00:17:59,757 --> 00:18:01,486
You said it was okay.

283
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:03,786
You said she was bald!

284
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:07,658
Was! Was, was, was!

285
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:12,733
We can't let it happen. We have to do
something. We have to break them up.

286
00:18:13,037 --> 00:18:17,371
Just go in there and shave her head!
You owe me one bald girl!

287
00:18:19,076 --> 00:18:20,976
Okay, first of all, breathe.

288
00:18:22,246 --> 00:18:24,510
Second of all, l don't get it.

289
00:18:24,782 --> 00:18:28,013
Aren't you the one that decided
you didn't want to be with Ross?

290
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:31,283
Yes.

291
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:35,186
Well, isn't he your friend?
Don't you want him to be happy?

292
00:18:39,363 --> 00:18:40,694
So?

293
00:18:44,802 --> 00:18:49,330
lt's just, you know, l didn't
expect him to be this happy so soon.

294
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,039
-Oh, no.
-What?

295
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:01,377
We killed them all!

296
00:19:17,568 --> 00:19:20,435
lt's not as bad as it looks.
lt's a precaution.

297
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:23,572
l'm not supposed to move my spine.

298
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:27,641
Please tell me you're stopping now.

299
00:19:27,878 --> 00:19:31,370
l'm fine. l'd fight tonight
if they'd let me.

300
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,984
Now, see this circle
l'm marking off here?

301
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:37,552
This is my Zone of Terror.

302
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:43,425
You are insane!
You've got to give this up!

303
00:19:43,594 --> 00:19:46,461
l can't until l'm
the ultimate fighter.

304
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,824
l will do it.

305
00:19:48,032 --> 00:19:52,298
The day will come when children will
argue over who will win a fight...

306
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:54,561
...me or Superman.

307
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:59,376
Not that l could beat Superman,
but kids are stupid.

308
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:01,840
Just sit down.

309
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:03,911
Please listen to me.

310
00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:09,142
You are terrible at this, okay? You
are the worst ultimate fighter ever.

311
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:10,713
Ever!

312
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:16,083
l have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline
fracture in my right forearm...

313
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:20,559
...and a severely bruised Adam's
apple, but that really hurt.

314
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,334
Well, then, you know what?

315
00:20:30,407 --> 00:20:34,571
l care about you too much to watch you
hurt yourself like this.

316
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:38,446
So if you have to do this,
you'll have to do it without me.

317
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:40,883
lf you're asking me to quit...

318
00:20:41,185 --> 00:20:43,949
...then you're asking me
to be someone l'm not.

319
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:45,813
l've got to do this.

320
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,994
Then l've gotta go.

321
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:54,721
Bye.

322
00:21:00,471 --> 00:21:02,905
-Monica?
-Yes?

323
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:05,132
Could you leave a note?
l'm on painkillers...

324
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:07,639
...and l might not
remember this tomorrow.

325
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:17,977
So, in conclusion, the lines
all go up, so l'm happy.

326
00:21:18,956 --> 00:21:21,322
Great job, team!
Tomorrow at 8:30.

327
00:21:21,826 --> 00:21:24,886
Phil, nice job! Stevens, way to go!

328
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:27,325
Goldberg, you maniac!

329
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:29,123
l love you!

330
00:21:32,436 --> 00:21:35,234
-Couldn't have done it without you.
-Thank you, sir.

331
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:36,736
Oh, excuse me.

332
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:40,672
l forgot my briefcase, you know,
by accident.

333
00:21:40,945 --> 00:21:44,472
Of course, you did. Forgot
something else too, you bastard!

334
00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:49,415
Well, what about you?

335
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:51,987
You're not feeling left out, are you?

336
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,054
No, not at all. That's ridiculous.

337
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:59,355
Everybody else got one,
and you want one too. Don't you?

338
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:03,997
Yes, l do.

339
00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:06,427
Now, get on out of here, you!

340
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:12,670
Pete Becker circles the ring.

341
00:22:12,843 --> 00:22:15,311
Looks like he's just trying
to feel him out.

342
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:16,969
-Bruiser is charging!
-Run.

343
00:22:17,147 --> 00:22:20,776
Run, you crazy, rich freak!

344
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:22,979
l can't watch this.

345
00:22:23,153 --> 00:22:24,848
Check it out! Pete's winning!

346
00:22:25,022 --> 00:22:27,217
-Really?
-No!

347
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:34,164
Bruiser has Becker on the canvas
and is going for his favorite area!

348
00:22:35,966 --> 00:22:39,868
Wait! lf that's his favorite area,
why is he being so mean to it?

349
00:22:40,537 --> 00:22:41,697
This is ironic.

350
00:22:41,872 --> 00:22:44,636
Your last boyfriend, Richard,
didn't want to have kids.

351
00:22:44,808 --> 00:22:46,002
From the looks of it,
now Pete can't.

352
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,669
