1
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:10,674
-What you guys doing?
-Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.

2
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:16,510
Why are you guys upset?
It's Old Yeller. It's a happy movie.

3
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,143
-What?
-What are you talking about?

4
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,651
Come on. Happy family gets a dog.

5
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,447
Frontier fun!

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,122
Pheebs, what about the end?

7
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:30,525
When Yeller saves the family
and everyone's happy?

8
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:31,823
That's not the end.

9
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:35,969
That's when my mother would
shut off the TV and say, "The end."

10
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,402
What about when he has rabies?

11
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:42,002
He doesn't have rabies.
He has babies.

12
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,636
That's what my mom said.

13
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:50,417
I don't think she'd want you
to see what's about to happen.

14
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:53,047
Why? What's about to happen?

15
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:55,017
I've never seen this part.

16
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,324
Hey, Travis, what you doing
with that gun?

17
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,986
Oh, no.

18
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,494
No, no, Travis, put down the gun.

19
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,423
No, no, he's your buddy.
He's your Yeller.

20
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,100
No! The end! The end!

21
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,869
Okay, what kind of a sick
doggy snuff film is this?

22
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:20,005
The One Where Old Yeller Dies

23
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:09,152
Have you guys eaten? Richard and l
just finished, and we've got leftovers.

24
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,458
Chicken and potatoes.

25
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:14,367
What am I wearing?

26
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,463
Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.

27
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:27,003
One of these times, you'll really
be naked and we won't come over.

28
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:30,116
That teach me a lesson.

29
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:33,879
I got a leg, three breasts
and a wing.

30
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:36,546
How do you find clothes that fit?

31
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:40,348
Hey, Monica? We got a question.

32
00:02:40,624 --> 00:02:43,957
All right, yes, I see other women
in the shower at the gym.

33
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:45,627
And no, I don't look.

34
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,827
No, not that one.

35
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:50,965
We're figuring out who to bring
to the Nicks game.

36
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:55,729
Ross can't go, so it's between my friend
Eric Prower, who has breath issues...

37
00:02:56,373 --> 00:02:59,171
...and Dan, with the poking.
"Did you see that play?"

38
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:02,471
"You want more beer?
Is that Spike Lee?"

39
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:07,581
Why don't you ask Richard?

40
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,050
Richard, if you had an extra
ticket to the Nicks game...

41
00:03:14,725 --> 00:03:17,717
...and you had to choose between
a friend who smelled...

42
00:03:17,928 --> 00:03:21,694
...and one who bruises you,
who would you pick?

43
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:25,098
Being a huge Nicks fan myself...

44
00:03:25,369 --> 00:03:29,328
... I think you should take someone
who's a huge Nicks fan.

45
00:03:31,442 --> 00:03:33,034
That's Eric.

46
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:36,439
Glad to be of help.
Matches.

47
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:40,941
I meant, why don't you
take Richard to the game?

48
00:03:41,885 --> 00:03:43,045
What?

49
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:46,512
-I don't know.
-Come on!

50
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,090
He keeps his fingers to himself,
and he's always minty fresh.

51
00:03:51,428 --> 00:03:54,955
Richard's really nice.
We just don't know him really well.

52
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,894
Plus, he's old

53
00:03:59,203 --> 00:04:01,603
er than some people.

54
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:04,699
But younger than some buildings.

55
00:04:06,977 --> 00:04:09,309
So what, he's a little older.
Big deal.

56
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:11,080
He's important to me.

57
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:14,250
If you ask him,
he might take you in his Jag.

58
00:04:19,056 --> 00:04:20,216
How do we say yes...

59
00:04:20,457 --> 00:04:23,915
...and make it seem like it's not
just to ride in the cool car?

60
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,254
Okay, this could be tough.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,561
We'll bring him,
but only if he takes the Jaguar.

62
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:37,941
You almost had it.

63
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:46,441
No, no, you're fine. You're fine.

64
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:50,447
Hi, honey.

65
00:04:50,654 --> 00:04:53,122
You are not gonna believe
what happened!

66
00:04:53,323 --> 00:04:56,486
We were playing on the floor,
and he grabs the table...

67
00:04:56,694 --> 00:04:58,685
...and he pulls himself up!

68
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:02,290
He pulled himself up!

69
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:03,989
Standing man!

70
00:05:05,202 --> 00:05:08,933
I'm sorry you missed it,
but I did tape it if you wanna see it.

71
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:12,002
We know. He already did it last week.

72
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:14,300
You can watch our tape if you want.

73
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:18,948
See, I don't believe this.
I missed the first time of everything.

74
00:05:19,183 --> 00:05:22,346
The first time he rolled over,
the first time he crawled.

75
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:24,883
What else? Has he spoken?
Is he driving?

76
00:05:25,155 --> 00:05:27,680
Does he have a favorite liqueur?

77
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:30,451
He is getting closer
on the talking thing.

78
00:05:30,694 --> 00:05:33,959
He can't quite say "mama" yet,
but once he said "Yemen."

79
00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:37,998
See, I don't know.
I'm so sick of missing stuff.

80
00:05:38,302 --> 00:05:41,738
I want him for more than a day.
I want him for a whole weekend.

81
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:42,972
Listen. I feel

82
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:44,674
That would be great.

83
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:50,240
Really? I had a whole speech prepared.

84
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:52,573
Oh, shoot, that would've been fun.

85
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,011
Did you just see that?

86
00:05:57,221 --> 00:05:59,746
Did you see? He just waved!
He just waved!

87
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,288
He's never waved before!

88
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:04,723
Yes, he has. Very good.

89
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:09,890
What you got there?

90
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:14,035
Love Story, Brian's Song and
Terms of Endearment.

91
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:19,700
All you need now is The Killing Fields
and guacamole, and you got a party!

92
00:06:21,044 --> 00:06:24,036
I talked to my grandma
about the Old Yeller incident...

93
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:28,047
...and she said my mom used to not
show us the ends of sad movies...

94
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:30,946
...to shield us from
the pain and sadness.

95
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:33,746
You know, before she killed herself.

96
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:39,858
Where's Richard?
Did you ditch him?

97
00:06:40,397 --> 00:06:43,059
After we stole his lunch money
and gave him a wedgie.

98
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:47,029
What's the matter?
He's parking the car.

99
00:06:47,638 --> 00:06:51,574
-Did you guys have fun?
-Your boyfriend is so cool.

100
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:55,905
He let us drive his Jaguar.
Joey for 12 blocks. Me for 15.

101
00:06:57,748 --> 00:06:59,215
He must like you best.

102
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:03,114
What about when he tipped the guy
who showed us to our seats?

103
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,311
You never even saw the money.

104
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:08,889
Hey, Chandler, thanks for
showing us to our seats.

105
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:12,421
You're welcome. Hey, Joey,
thanks for parking the car.

106
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:14,324
No problem.

107
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,794
-Hey, Chandler
-I think they get it.

108
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,630
There's the man!

109
00:07:23,774 --> 00:07:25,503
Hey, you're getting better.

110
00:07:26,276 --> 00:07:27,743
I'm gonna keep this.

111
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,912
He kept my dollar.

112
00:07:37,321 --> 00:07:39,789
Your first weekend without Ben.
What are you doing?

113
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,855
We're going to
colonial Williamsburg.

114
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:46,620
A woman I went to college with is
the first female blacksmith there.

115
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,993
They're a little behind the times
in colonial Williamsburg.

116
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:53,769
Look, I better go
before Mommy starts weeping.

117
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:56,870
-We love you.
-Bye, Mommy.

118
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,937
Have a good time.

119
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:03,543
Look.

120
00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:13,281
Joey, do you know
we can see you from here?

121
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:17,383
How come Richard looks cooler
with one of these?

122
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:20,529
You may wanna light it
and lose the spatula.

123
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,290
It's cute, you trying
to be more like Richard.

124
00:08:25,502 --> 00:08:27,333
Not like him, per se.

125
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:29,664
Just not unlike him.

126
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:42,412
It's the artist formerly known
as Chandler.

127
00:08:44,021 --> 00:08:46,683
I'm just trying something here,
you know?

128
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:48,752
Why didn't you grow a mustache?

129
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:50,083
We flipped for it.

130
00:08:50,394 --> 00:08:52,919
I got the cigar,he got the mustache.

131
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,255
If we both grew them,
we'd look like dorks.

132
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:59,828
You really sidestepped
that land mine.

133
00:09:00,537 --> 00:09:03,097
I promised Richard
we'd meet him downstairs.

134
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,398
You're meeting Richard?

135
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:06,235
-Ranger game.
-Didn't he tell you?

136
00:09:06,576 --> 00:09:09,773
He said he was going out with the guys.
I didn't know that was you.

137
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,206
You hear that?

138
00:09:11,448 --> 00:09:13,211
We're the guys!

139
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:17,176
With that mustache,
he reminds me of Aunt Sylvia.

140
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:18,615
Thank you!

141
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:29,632
Hi. We're visiting.

142
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,393
It's Ben and his dada.

143
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:38,230
Can you say "dada"?

144
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:41,903
I'm telling your mommies you said it,
so you might as well.

145
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:43,579
No luck, huh?

146
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,146
A while ago,
I got a "seh" out of him...

147
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:51,285
...which I thought might turn into
"seh-condary caregiver," but....

148
00:09:54,257 --> 00:09:58,023
Would you hold him for a sec?
I gotta take this off.

149
00:09:58,228 --> 00:10:00,128
Sure. Okay.

150
00:10:05,902 --> 00:10:07,130
What are you doing?

151
00:10:07,337 --> 00:10:09,305
I'm holding Ben.

152
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:13,166
He's a baby, not a bomb.

153
00:10:15,412 --> 00:10:17,175
Hold him like you'd hold a football.

154
00:10:17,848 --> 00:10:20,180
This is how I would hold a football.

155
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,612
Here. Here. There we go.

156
00:10:22,853 --> 00:10:27,222
Sorry, I'm not very good with babies.
I haven't been around them.

157
00:10:27,424 --> 00:10:29,517
I mean, you know, since I was one.

158
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,422
-It's all right. No big deal.
-Really?

159
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:35,597
I'm sure you'll feel different
when it's our baby.

160
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:37,629
-What?
-What?

161
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:40,300
You think about stuff like that?

162
00:10:41,171 --> 00:10:43,196
Yeah. I mean....

163
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:47,835
Actually, I kind of think
that we'll have two babies.

164
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:51,542
Two babies?

165
00:10:51,782 --> 00:10:53,841
You know, a boy and a girl.

166
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:57,450
Hopefully, the girl will come first,
so Ben won't feel competitive.

167
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,986
Then what's gonna happen?

168
00:11:02,192 --> 00:11:06,219
We won't wanna raise kids in the city,
so we'll move to Scarsdale.

169
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:11,632
We'll be far enough from our parents
so we don't have to see them...

170
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:14,234
... but close enough
that they can baby-sit.

171
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:18,669
And yes, I know the taxes are
a little higher than Nassau County...

172
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:20,900
... but the school system's great.

173
00:11:24,214 --> 00:11:26,478
Wow, that's great! Great!

174
00:11:27,317 --> 00:11:29,308
Okay, wow! You know what?

175
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,419
I'm off my break now.

176
00:11:32,756 --> 00:11:34,314
Here. You take this.

177
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:40,228
I'm gonna go pour these
very nice people some coffee.

178
00:11:41,264 --> 00:11:43,232
Look at that. I don't have a pot.

179
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:45,867
I don't have a pot.
Maybe I've got one at home.

180
00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:48,401
Or in Scarsdale.
Hey, is that a door?

181
00:11:57,212 --> 00:11:58,975
Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?

182
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:02,809
Murder, cancer, soccer teams eating
each other in the Andes.

183
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:07,809
I was really just need a small talk.

184
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:09,752
Ok, I was just fanting.

185
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:11,481
So you watched the movies?

186
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:14,245
What is happening to the world?

187
00:12:14,724 --> 00:12:17,659
I mean....
No, no, because E.T. Ieaves...

188
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:20,557
...and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.

189
00:12:20,897 --> 00:12:22,194
Charlotte who?

190
00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:23,865
With the web. The spider.

191
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:26,092
She dies. She has babies and dies.

192
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:29,396
It's like, "Welcome home
from the hospital." Thud!

193
00:12:31,174 --> 00:12:32,835
You wanna feel better?

194
00:12:35,512 --> 00:12:38,037
Here. Watch this.

195
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:40,841
It's a Wonderful Life.
I've heard of this.

196
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:43,678
So you can't lose.
It's there in the title.

197
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:45,616
Wonderfulness is baked right in.

198
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:48,255
I fell for that with
Pride of the Yankees.

199
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:50,516
I thought I'd see a film
about Yankee pride.

200
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:53,628
And boom! The guy gets
Lou Gehrig's disease.

201
00:12:55,598 --> 00:12:59,864
The guy was Lou Gehrig.
Didn't you kind of see it coming?

202
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:04,635
Watch that. It'll restore
all your faith in humanity.

203
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:07,100
Hey, big guy. Game time.

204
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,140
-Hey! Be right there!
-There's a game?

205
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:13,612
I just got my Pik-Up Stiks
back from the shop.

206
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:16,742
Bring your nerves of steel.

207
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,023
It's the basketball playoffs.

208
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:25,695
I appreciate this, but you don't
have to hang out with them for me.

209
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:27,362
They have each other.

210
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:29,792
Oh, no, honey. I mean, don't worry.

211
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:33,935
I like hanging out with them.
They're different than my other friends.

212
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:38,164
They don't start sentences with
"You know who just died shoveling snow?"

213
00:13:39,476 --> 00:13:41,671
All right, that's great.
Then just go.

214
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:43,878
Go Nicks!

215
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,809
It's the college playoffs.

216
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:48,449
-Then, go Vassar!
-They're not in it.

217
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:50,483
Okay, then just go.

218
00:13:52,856 --> 00:13:54,687
Why does this bother me so much?

219
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,622
I'm not one of those people who wants
to spend 24 hours a day together.

220
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:01,023
Sure.

221
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:04,359
He just doesn't have much free time.
What do I do?

222
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:08,526
Does it matter? You'll just die
or divorce or blow your pet's head off.

223
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:13,574
Me too!

224
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,211
Rachel, I got a question. Richard
made plans again with the guys

225
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:19,382
Ross made plans for the century.

226
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:23,675
I'm gonna go read Cosmo.
Maybe there's something helpful in it.

227
00:14:23,887 --> 00:14:28,654
If not, I can learn how to do a bikini
wax with leftover Christmas candles.

228
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:33,560
What happened back there?

229
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,559
I don't know. You tell me.

230
00:14:35,765 --> 00:14:38,529
One minute I'm holding Ben,
then I've got two kids...

231
00:14:38,735 --> 00:14:41,704
... I'm living in Scarsdale
complaining about taxes!

232
00:14:41,938 --> 00:14:44,532
Well, I'm sorry.
I think about stuff.

233
00:14:44,774 --> 00:14:48,403
You're at work, you're assembling bones,
your mind wanders.

234
00:14:48,611 --> 00:14:52,274
You've planned out the next 20 years.
We've dated for six weeks!

235
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:54,506
You never think about our future?

236
00:14:54,751 --> 00:14:57,777
I think about whose apartment
we'll sleep at tomorrow...

237
00:14:58,021 --> 00:15:00,012
...and where we'll have dinner
next Saturday!

238
00:15:00,223 --> 00:15:02,748
I do not think about
our children's names!

239
00:15:04,127 --> 00:15:06,755
You know what our
children's names will be?

240
00:15:07,797 --> 00:15:12,234
No, I mean, you know. I read a book,
and there was a girl named Emily.

241
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:14,630
And I thought that might be good.

242
00:15:16,606 --> 00:15:17,470
What book?

243
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:20,639
The Big Book of Children's Names.

244
00:15:23,313 --> 00:15:24,439
Okay, listen.

245
00:15:24,714 --> 00:15:26,147
What we have is amazing.

246
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:29,113
But I do not want
everything decided for me!

247
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:30,980
I spent my whole life like that.

248
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:33,779
It's what I had with Barry.
That's a reason I left.

249
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,958
I like not knowing right now.

250
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:40,228
Sorry if that scares you, but if you
wanna be with me, deal with that!

251
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,125
-Okay, fine!
-Thank you!

252
00:15:42,332 --> 00:15:44,800
-We're not done!
-I didn't know that.

253
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:49,295
You're with a guy who won't stop
planning his future with you.

254
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:51,337
He knows we'll end up together.

255
00:15:51,608 --> 00:15:54,668
If that scares you, tough!
You'll have to deal with that.

256
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:56,845
-I will!
-Good, because I love you!

257
00:15:57,113 --> 00:15:58,637
Oh, yeah? I love you too!

258
00:15:58,848 --> 00:16:01,078
-That's the first time we've said that!
-Yes, it is!

259
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:03,775
-I'm gonna kiss you!
-You better!

260
00:16:11,694 --> 00:16:13,252
Thanks for the great movie tip.

261
00:16:13,463 --> 00:16:15,328
-Did you like it?
-Oh, yeah.

262
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:19,024
I don't know if I was happier when
George Bailey destroyed the business...

263
00:16:19,302 --> 00:16:23,204
...or Donna Reed cried or when
the pharmacist made his ear bleed.

264
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:27,872
I'll give you the ear thing,
but wasn't the ending wonderful?

265
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:30,279
I didn't watch it.
I was too depressed.

266
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:32,777
It kept getting worse!
It should've been called:

267
00:16:33,016 --> 00:16:37,316
"It's a Sucky Life, And Just When You
Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!"

268
00:16:40,056 --> 00:16:41,489
IKick, save! And...

269
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:42,986
...denied!

270
00:16:43,726 --> 00:16:47,059
He gets it back.
Pass to the middle, lines it up....

271
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:48,828
Yes!

272
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:52,126
Could that shot be any prettier?

273
00:16:52,802 --> 00:16:54,360
Man, you are incredible.

274
00:16:54,571 --> 00:16:56,334
We had a table in college.

275
00:16:56,539 --> 00:16:59,804
Really? I didn't know they had
foosball in the 1800s.

276
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:04,639
Nice mustache. At puberty,
that thing will really kick in.

277
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:12,414
Not to sound too Florence Henderson,
but dinner's on the table.

278
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:13,679
One more point.

279
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:17,987
Score!

280
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:21,086
Now can we go?

281
00:17:21,731 --> 00:17:23,858
That's why we don't let her play.

282
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:27,761
Is everything all right?

283
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,600
Don't be mad at him.
It's our fault.

284
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:34,776
I'm sorry we've been hogging his time.

285
00:17:35,044 --> 00:17:37,103
He's just really great
to hang out with.

286
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,507
-Well....
-No, seriously.

287
00:17:38,715 --> 00:17:42,276
We just talked about this.
He is so much cooler than our dads.

288
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:48,053
Our dads are okay and all,
but Richard is just

289
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:49,919
What are you kicking me for?

290
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:53,926
I'm trying to talk here.

291
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,266
You guys see me as a dad?

292
00:17:58,468 --> 00:18:00,402
-Oh, yeah!
-No!

293
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,270
You're just clearly not familiar
with our young persons' vernacular.

294
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,639
When we say "dad," we mean "buddy."

295
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:14,410
We mean "pal."

296
00:18:14,617 --> 00:18:17,415
No, seriously. Joey's my dad.

297
00:18:20,156 --> 00:18:21,987
Monica's my dad.

298
00:18:22,425 --> 00:18:25,258
I've even got some dads down at work.

299
00:18:25,828 --> 00:18:26,795
That's fine.

300
00:18:27,063 --> 00:18:31,227
Well, your other dad and I are gonna
go have a romantic evening.

301
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:33,492
I'll just see you kids around.

302
00:18:33,803 --> 00:18:35,065
Nighty-night.

303
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:36,829
You're not a dad!

304
00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:40,572
I can't believe you got us
into trouble.

305
00:18:54,616 --> 00:18:56,140
So are you okay?

306
00:18:58,186 --> 00:18:59,175
Just...

307
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:01,922
... I feel like I'm about a hundred.

308
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:05,253
I thought I was just one of the guys.

309
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,020
Come here.

310
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:09,923
I'll make you feel like
one of the guys.

311
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,862
For a really cool guy,
you suck at foosball.

312
00:19:19,874 --> 00:19:21,774
I was killing them.

313
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:24,207
Yeah, well they suck too.

314
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:30,940
You take the poopy diaper
and put it in the poopy diaper pail.

315
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:35,315
Calling it a "poopy diaper"
doesn't make this process any cuter.

316
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:41,324
-It's us.
-Come on up.

317
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:43,156
I'll get his stuff together.

318
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:46,400
Okay, we can do this now,
can't we, Ben?

319
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,401
Yes, we can.

320
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,864
Yes, we can.

321
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:53,873
There! I did it!

322
00:19:55,076 --> 00:19:56,338
I did it!

323
00:19:57,345 --> 00:19:59,245
Look at that!

324
00:19:59,714 --> 00:20:01,807
It stays on and everything.

325
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:12,452
I'm sorry. What did you just say?
Did you just say "hi"?

326
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:15,494
Oh, my God! Ross?
Ben just said hi!

327
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,027
-What?
-Ben just said hi!

328
00:20:17,265 --> 00:20:18,698
What, the word "hi"?

329
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,731
No, my Uncle Hi.

330
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:24,701
Great! And I missed that too.
I miss everything!

331
00:20:24,939 --> 00:20:28,670
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just
bring it out in him.

332
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:31,842
-Where is he?
-We missed you.

333
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,572
We missed you so much!
Come here, Ben.

334
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:38,252
Guess what?
Ben just said his first word.

335
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,246
What did he say?

336
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:42,012
Something about hi.

337
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:46,887
That's so exciting!
Mommy's so proud of you!

338
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,257
You know, actually,
it's more like, hi!

339
00:20:56,905 --> 00:20:58,600
This could go on for a while.

340
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,798
You're right.
We've got a cab waiting.

341
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:02,771
Well, this was fun.

342
00:21:02,977 --> 00:21:06,435
We should do it again sometime, Ben.
What do you say?

343
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:10,042
-All right, so I've got him...?
-Tuesday.

344
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:11,382
Bye, you guys.

345
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:13,577
-Take care.
-Bye, Ben.

346
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:19,653
Did he just say "bye"?

347
00:21:19,894 --> 00:21:21,054
He said bye!

348
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:23,297
You said bye!
He said bye to me!

349
00:21:23,565 --> 00:21:25,430
Yes, he did!

350
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:28,227
Suddenly I'm seeing him
go off to college!

351
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:32,271
We've gotta go.
We've got that cab downstairs.

352
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:34,469
See you later.

353
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,253
Look at this nice deep hole I dug.
Hey, Bert...

354
00:21:55,497 --> 00:21:57,727
...isn't this a nice hole here?

355
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,094
Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries
Bert in the sand and can't find him.

356
00:22:03,738 --> 00:22:08,675
Now, I've looked ahead on the tape,
and he does find him again.

357
00:22:09,944 --> 00:22:13,573
But before that happens,
there's some rough going for a while.

358
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:15,875
But I think we can handle it.

359
00:22:16,184 --> 00:22:21,121
And there's just the alphabet,
but we know that ends well, so....

360
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:22,783
Here we go.

361
00:22:23,024 --> 00:22:24,582
Bert? Bert?

362
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,920
What happened to my friend Bert?
He was here just a moment ago.

363
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,361
Oh, no! My old friend Bert is lost.

364
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,591
I'm so glad you're here.
