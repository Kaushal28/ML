1
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:10,795
-What's up?
-I left my guitar here.

2
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:13,464
Okay. No problem.

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,761
Okay. Here you go.

4
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:26,602
-What?
-You want to hang out or something?

5
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:29,564
You caught me at a bad time.

6
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:32,442
-Are you and Chandler..?
-Exactly.

7
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:34,569
-Can I play for you?
-No.

8
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:40,283
Hey, Pheebs, what's up?

9
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:47,039
You ask an intriguing question,
Chandler Bing.

10
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:56,132
Oh, my God! You're getting a massage?
You never let me massage you.

11
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,050
Phoebe, I can explain.

12
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:00,928
You see..

13
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:03,639
God, I gotta get better at lying.

14
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:06,684
You said you hate massages.

15
00:01:06,893 --> 00:01:11,105
Buy stamps. Pick up dry cleaning.
Don't let Phoebe in.

16
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:15,276
How long has this been going on?

17
00:01:15,693 --> 00:01:19,238
-Well, Alexandra has..
-It has a name?

18
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:22,575
Phoebe, don't get upset.

19
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:28,080
Okay. Oh, too late! I'm leaving.
Come on, Chandler, let's go.

20
00:01:29,248 --> 00:01:31,167
Well, I thought I'd..

21
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,211
Yeah, what the hell.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,629
One more push.
Come on, we're almost there.

23
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:22,593
I'm happy things worked out for us
and we're having this baby. I love you.

24
00:02:22,844 --> 00:02:24,929
I love you too.

25
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:28,266
I hope it's not
an inappropriate time to say..

26
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,143
you're the best sex I've ever had.

27
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:34,272
That's always appropriate.

28
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:38,150
Okay, come on, one more push.
One more push.

29
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:42,780
There we go.

30
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:49,287
Here is your beautiful baby.
Congratulations.

31
00:02:57,086 --> 00:03:01,340
I hope you're a better father
than you are a friend!

32
00:03:06,012 --> 00:03:07,263
Joey!

33
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:10,558
-What's going on?
-Come feel my belly.

34
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,770
-The baby's kicking for the first time.
-Really?

35
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:16,522
Yes.

36
00:03:16,772 --> 00:03:19,317
You know what? Maybe you..

37
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:24,697
Maybe you should come to me.
I'm not wearing any bottoms.

38
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:29,160
Oh, my God.

39
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,203
It's unbelievable!

40
00:03:31,454 --> 00:03:34,999
Wow, she is kicking so much.
She's like..

41
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:38,210
Who's that annoying
girl soccer player?

42
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:41,422
-Mia Hamm?
-Mia Hamm!

43
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:46,010
-It's amazing.
-One hand on the sheet, Joe.

44
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,304
Sorry.

45
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:54,560
Hey, babe.

46
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,899
We got a wedding gift from Bob and
Faye Bing. They don't like us, do they?

47
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:04,612
Who says you can't get
a nice punch bowl for under $6?

48
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,532
-Maybe we can take it back.
-Where would we return it?

49
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:11,869
How about to the street,
from the balcony?

50
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,247
We can't do that.
What if they come by for a visit?

51
00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:19,085
Let's cross that bridge when my aunt
and uncle who I haven't seen in 15 years..

52
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:22,088
drop by unexpectedly and
demand a giant bowl of punch.

53
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:26,926
Why don't we just find a place for it?

54
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,305
In that cabinet?

55
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:37,061
That's for canned goods. Have you
forgotten everything from orientation?

56
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,941
How about the closet by the bathroom?

57
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:45,444
-Okay. Let me do it.
-No, I'll do it.

58
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:50,741
You have to relax and let me
take care of things once in a while.

59
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:55,246
It's locked. You have to help me.
Why is it locked?

60
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:58,791
No reason.
I keep private things in there.

61
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:03,254
I've been here a while,
and I've never seen what's in there.

62
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:05,464
What is in there?

63
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,466
Feminine stuff.

64
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:11,137
Don't try to make me uncomfortable
with feminine stuff!

65
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:17,977
Nothing in there concerns you.
If you love me, you'll just let it go.

66
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,981
-Fine.
-Thank you.

67
00:05:26,944 --> 00:05:29,030
Love you.

68
00:05:30,614 --> 00:05:34,827
Hello, Chandler.
Lovely day, huh? You.

69
00:05:36,912 --> 00:05:42,168
If it helps, Alexandra's only
been massaging her for three years.

70
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:47,214
If! I said, if it helps.

71
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:52,470
Why won't you let me massage you?

72
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,224
I'd be self-conscious.
You're my friend. I'd be naked.

73
00:05:57,516 --> 00:06:01,353
We lived together for years.
I've seen you naked.

74
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:05,024
That's different. We were roommates.
And when?

75
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:09,862
I'm curious about the human body.

76
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:14,033
You can understand
why this would be weird.

77
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,952
I'm a professional
and I'm really good.

78
00:06:17,161 --> 00:06:21,874
If you're uncomfortable, we can stop.
Give me a chance. Please?

79
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,710
If it means that much to you.

80
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:28,964
It does. How would you feel
if you couldn't share your cooking?

81
00:06:29,215 --> 00:06:33,511
Or how Ross would feel
if he couldn't teach us about dragons.

82
00:06:34,553 --> 00:06:37,723
-Dinosaurs.
-Potato, potahto.

83
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:43,938
Ross, the baby's kicking.

84
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,232
What? It is?

85
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,572
It's not kicking now.

86
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:58,160
Although we would love
to see you do that again.

87
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,287
When? What happened?

88
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:04,250
Last night. I went into Joey's room,
and he was sleeping.

89
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,086
A dreamless sleep.

90
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:11,549
My God, the baby's kicking.
That's great.

91
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:17,346
I wish I would have been there to feel
the kicking for the first time.

92
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:21,308
I got some stuff going on
if you want to feel.

93
00:07:22,184 --> 00:07:24,019
I'll pass, but you look radiant.

94
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:32,570
I don't want to miss any more baby
stuff. Here's my pager number.

95
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:36,365
Anytime anything pregnancy-related
happens, use it.

96
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:39,743
I don't care if it's 3 a.m.
and you want ice cream.

97
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:42,580
Can I get a copy of that?

98
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,087
-Are you under the sheet?
-Yes.

99
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:54,675
Great, let's begin.

100
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:04,476
How's the pressure?

101
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:08,564
It's nice. Wow, Phoebe, you are good.

102
00:08:08,814 --> 00:08:11,609
Stating the obvious, but thank you.

103
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:15,946
-And it's not weird, is it?
-No.

104
00:08:18,073 --> 00:08:21,160
That's right, you just enjoy.

105
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:25,748
Oh, yeah!

106
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:35,132
-Oh, yeah!
-Okay.

107
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:38,886
Oh, God, Phoebe!

108
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:43,265
That's it! That's it, right there!

109
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:58,739
I wasn't trying to open
your closet, I swear.

110
00:08:59,782 --> 00:09:05,663
Monica runs a pretty tight ship here,
doesn't she? What are you doing?

111
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:09,124
Monica has a secret closet.
She won't let me see it.

112
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:13,754
-Why not?
-I don't know! What's she hiding?

113
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:16,173
I don't know.

114
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:18,884
I bet it's Richard.

115
00:09:19,969 --> 00:09:21,679
-What?
-Before you say I'm wrong..

116
00:09:21,845 --> 00:09:23,180
let me ask you something.

117
00:09:23,347 --> 00:09:25,391
When was the last time you saw him?

118
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:28,894
Why would she keep Richard in here?

119
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:31,355
Off the top of my head..

120
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:34,984
maybe she's having her cake
and eating it too.

121
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:38,612
You being the "cake,"
Richard being the "too."

122
00:09:38,988 --> 00:09:41,907
-That was off the top of your head?
-Yeah.

123
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:46,745
-Or..
-And here we go.

124
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:51,458
I saw a movie where there was a door.
Nobody knew what was behind it.

125
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,422
When they finally got it open,
millions of bugs came pouring out..

126
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,175
and they feasted on human flesh!

127
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:04,972
It wouldn't kill you
to respect your wife's privacy!

128
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:12,896
Stupid closet full of bugs!

129
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:18,652
Joey, something feels weird
and not good weird. I don't..

130
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,071
When my sisters were pregnant..

131
00:10:21,238 --> 00:10:24,658
they got weird feelings
and it was always nothing.

132
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:26,577
-Really?
-Absolutely.

133
00:10:26,785 --> 00:10:31,206
But we'll stop by the hospital
just to be sure. I'll page Ross.

134
00:10:31,457 --> 00:10:37,629
Rach, look at me. Everything's fine.
Trust me. Take my hand. Here we go.

135
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,965
Crushing bones!

136
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:43,469
Good thing we're going to a hospital.

137
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:45,304
-Open it.
-Why'd you..

138
00:10:45,471 --> 00:10:47,514
Watch your feet.
There's bugs everywhere.

139
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,650
-So?
-She's fine.

140
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:03,947
She had Braxton Hicks contractions.
Mild discomfort in the uterine wall.

141
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:09,161
Mild discomfort? I take it you've had
one of these Braxton thingies?

142
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,163
-Everything's normal?
-Yes.

143
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,582
-There's no danger?
-No.

144
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,960
Contractions can be unnerving,
but she's fine.

145
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:22,007
Thank you, doctor.
And thank you for being nice and calm.

146
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:26,220
I wasn't calm! I've never been
more scared in my life.

147
00:11:26,678 --> 00:11:31,475
-You said everything was okay.
-What do I know? I'm not a doctor.

148
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:35,604
-But everything is okay. I'm fine.
-You sure?

149
00:11:35,813 --> 00:11:39,650
Yes. I got half a mind
to contract that doctor's uterus.

150
00:11:39,858 --> 00:11:42,945
Mild discomfort!
What's he talking about?

151
00:11:43,195 --> 00:11:44,863
-Is everything okay?
-Yes.

152
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:48,158
Your page said, "Come to
the hospital." What happened?

153
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:52,287
Something called
Braxton Hicks contraction.

154
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:55,582
That's no big deal.
Most women don't feel them.

155
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,001
No uterus, no opinion.

156
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:01,713
What's with the candy?

157
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:05,217
I was at the concession stand
at the movies.

158
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:09,221
-You went to the movies by yourself?
-Mona!

159
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:13,308
-I gotta go back in there.
-What's wrong?

160
00:12:13,517 --> 00:12:17,938
-I just gotta..
-No, really, tell me. What's up?

161
00:12:18,147 --> 00:12:21,692
Look, I forgot my underwear.

162
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:27,364
Thanks for bringing her to the hospital.

163
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:30,409
Don't worry about it. No big deal.

164
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:34,413
But still, it should have been me.
I'm the dad.

165
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:38,750
-Here's information on Braxton Hicks.
-Thanks.

166
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:41,962
You did the right thing by bringing her in.

167
00:12:42,171 --> 00:12:44,631
You'll make a wonderful father.

168
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:51,263
Hey, not as good as this guy.
He brought Twizzlers.

169
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:01,773
-There has got to be a way.
-Easy there, Captain Kirk.

170
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:06,320
-Do you have a bobby pin?
-Yeah.

171
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,616
Oh, no, wait.
I'm not a 9-year-old girl.

172
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:13,035
Then why do you throw like one?

173
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:17,623
-Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
-Oh, sure, "Monica."

174
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:22,628
So how's the inappropriate
crush on Rachel coming?

175
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:27,299
Really good. I should be ready
to kill myself any day now.

176
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:30,802
Well, you sure found that quick.

177
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:39,144
I wish I didn't feel this way about
Rachel. I wish things could be normal.

178
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:44,316
I love living with her, and
helping out with the baby is amazing.

179
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:47,736
But now I think Ross feels left out.

180
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:53,242
When I took Rachel to the hospital,
the doctor thought I was the father.

181
00:13:53,492 --> 00:13:56,745
You should have seen
the look on Ross' face.

182
00:13:56,954 --> 00:14:01,667
I have no idea what I'm doing.
For all I know, I'm locking it more.

183
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:06,505
-You try opening it with a credit card?
-That's a good idea.

184
00:14:06,755 --> 00:14:10,342
So Ross is kind of bummed, huh?

185
00:14:10,592 --> 00:14:13,553
-I feel terrible.
-It's not your fault.

186
00:14:13,762 --> 00:14:17,975
What are you gonna do, not take her?
You're doing nothing wrong.

187
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:21,645
Except for harboring love
for the woman carrying his baby.

188
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:24,064
Well, there is that.

189
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:33,365
Richard, if you're in there,
could you pass me my credit card?

190
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:41,707
I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing.
That massage felt so good.

191
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:44,251
No, I got that.

192
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:48,171
-Can we make it a weekly appointment?
-Okay.

193
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:53,510
You should know though,
I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.

194
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:56,638
-Okay.
-I mean 500.

195
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:59,641
-What?
-600.

196
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,310
What's going on?

197
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:04,730
You make sex noises
when you get massaged.

198
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:10,277
It freaked me out. After a while,
I tried to hurt you. It spurred you on.

199
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:14,656
You're crazy. There's nothing sexual
about the noises I make.

200
00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:17,784
There's nothing sexual about this?

201
00:15:17,993 --> 00:15:20,454
Oh, God!

202
00:15:23,332 --> 00:15:26,460
What are you looking at?

203
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,253
I mean, hi.

204
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:34,926
Oh, that's why Alexandra wears earplugs
when she gives me a massage.

205
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,429
It's not because she hates Enya.

206
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:41,266
This is embarrassing.
I'm never getting a massage again.

207
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:44,519
Don't let this stop you
from getting massages.

208
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,315
I have lots of clients
that make those noises.

209
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:51,109
-Really?
-Well, not clients. Lovers.

210
00:15:53,403 --> 00:15:57,616
We'll try it again. Come back,
and we'll work through it.

211
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:00,661
-You sure?
-Yes.

212
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:05,082
-I guess.
-Great! Now, if you'll just excuse me.

213
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:09,002
So did you hear something you liked?

214
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:16,718
Hey, Ross, check it out!
I learned a new trick.

215
00:16:18,053 --> 00:16:22,182
You know, if you stick one hand down your
pants, you're the spitting image of Joey.

216
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:27,020
Hey, I brought you some lunch.

217
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:31,483
Oh, that's so sweet of you. Oh, yum.

218
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:38,657
-Did you put pickles on this?
-Well, yeah.

219
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:42,953
What? What? Rach, what?

220
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:46,206
-What's going on?
-I made her tuna with pickle.

221
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:49,126
Pickle? Pickle makes her sick.

222
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:53,338
Giving her pickle is like giving me salad.

223
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,508
I'm sorry, I didn't know. You okay?

224
00:16:56,717 --> 00:17:00,637
I'm fine, but someone make sure
it's gone when I get out?

225
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:02,973
I'm on it!

226
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:08,145
I shouldn't be the one making her throw up.

227
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:12,691
-It could happen to anyone.
-Not to you. You know this stuff.

228
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:15,694
I don't know any of it and I'm the father.

229
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:19,823
I wish I could be more involved, you know?

230
00:17:23,702 --> 00:17:29,458
Well, if anyone is keeping score,
I no longer eat tuna.

231
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:34,045
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

232
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:36,715
-Yeah.
-What's up?

233
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,178
Sit down.
I wanna talk about our situation.

234
00:17:41,386 --> 00:17:44,222
Are you breaking up with us?

235
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:47,767
The thing is..

236
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:55,108
because I live with Rachel,
I'm here for a lot of stuff.

237
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,779
And Ross is missing everything. So..

238
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,490
Yeah?

239
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:05,368
You two should live together.

240
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:08,580
Are you asking me to move?
You don't want me here?

241
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:13,210
No, I love living with you.
It just seems that..

242
00:18:13,502 --> 00:18:17,797
if you're gonna have a roommate,
it may as well be the father.

243
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:24,095
But, Joey, I don't think Ross wants me
to move in and disrupt his life.

244
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:28,058
Or he does.

245
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:32,813
I would love to be around
for you and the baby.

246
00:18:33,063 --> 00:18:36,441
We can just try it,
like on a temporary basis.

247
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,570
-But it's you and me.
-It wouldn't be anything romantic.

248
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:44,741
I'm dating Mona. Damn it, Mona!

249
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:49,913
I was supposed to meet her
an hour ago. What is wrong with me?

250
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:53,416
So, what do you think?

251
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,962
Living with the father of the baby.
It's a little conventional for us.

252
00:18:57,671 --> 00:19:00,131
Yeah, but hey, hey.
You always have liked my building.

253
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:04,511
And there's more room. I mean,
you could have a closet dedicated to shoes.

254
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:07,055
Oh, you do know your audience.

255
00:19:08,098 --> 00:19:11,017
-I don't know. Is it crazy?
-No.

256
00:19:11,226 --> 00:19:13,270
Joey, this is a smart idea.

257
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:16,940
Well, I was due.

258
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:19,693
-Let's do it.
-Really?

259
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:23,154
Rach, that's great. That's great.

260
00:19:25,615 --> 00:19:28,368
And you know what?
Don't worry about any of the moving.

261
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:31,329
I'll take care of everything.
In fact, I'll start right now.

262
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,039
Ross, Ross. Mona?

263
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,499
Unbelievable.

264
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:46,803
Not too shabby.
I got this all off myself..

265
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,764
using my wife's tools.

266
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:59,149
Oh, my God.

267
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:04,154
How did you get in there?

268
00:20:06,823 --> 00:20:08,617
You're messy.

269
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:14,956
-No! You weren't supposed to see this!
-I married Fred Sanford.

270
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:17,876
Chandler, you don't understand.

271
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,879
You know,
how I organize everything, right?

272
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:25,008
Okay, well this is all of the stuff
that doesn't fit into any category.

273
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,595
So you see, I'm not messy.

274
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:30,764
I'm just so organized that..

275
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:40,231
Okay, okay, fine! Now you know.
I'm sick.

276
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,654
No, honey, you're not sick. I don't
love you because you're organized.

277
00:20:45,862 --> 00:20:48,949
I love you in spite of that.

278
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,076
Really?

279
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:54,913
-Promise you won't tell anyone?
-Yes.

280
00:20:55,121 --> 00:21:00,877
Now that I know, if I've got extra stuff,
can we share the closet?

281
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:04,214
Well.. It's just..

282
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:07,300
I'm afraid you might mess it up.

283
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,766
-Hey.
-Hey.

284
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:19,896
So Rachel's all moved out?
How you taking it?

285
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,983
I wanted to have a few beers..

286
00:21:23,274 --> 00:21:27,445
but I got rid of those because
Rachel couldn't stand the smell.

287
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:31,282
I have thrown back a lot
of orange juice with calcium.

288
00:21:31,574 --> 00:21:37,330
It's a couple weeks past its expiration
date, so it's got a bit of a kick.

289
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:44,421
-Are you okay?
-You kidding me? Yeah, I'm great.

290
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:47,924
I'm better than great. I am good.

291
00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:56,141
Now that she's gone, I can do stuff
around here that I couldn't do before.

292
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:58,226
Like..

293
00:21:58,435 --> 00:22:00,937
I can walk around naked again.

294
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:03,022
I can..

295
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:06,776
I can watch porn in the living room.

296
00:22:07,444 --> 00:22:09,362
This is good for me.

297
00:22:09,654 --> 00:22:14,743
I like being on my own.
I'm better off this way.

298
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:17,370
I'm a lone wolf.

299
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,541
A loner. Alone.

300
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:26,546
All alone. Forever.

301
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:33,136
What's a wolf gotta do
to get a hug around here?

302
00:22:40,643 --> 00:22:43,688
That's it, just relax.

303
00:22:45,815 --> 00:22:48,234
-Come on, more.
-Oh, God!

304
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:51,029
You like that, don't you?

305
00:22:51,321 --> 00:22:55,825
-Yeah, right there.
-Want it there? Take it there, baby.

306
00:22:57,702 --> 00:23:01,664
-Phoebe?
-Yeah, say my name. Say it.

307
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:13,551
And now I'm going
to cover you back up.

308
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:18,681
And I won't be speaking with you
for several weeks.
