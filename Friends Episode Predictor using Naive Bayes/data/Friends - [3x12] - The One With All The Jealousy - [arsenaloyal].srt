1
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:06,383
-Does everybody hate these shoes?
-Yeah.

2
00:00:06,818 --> 00:00:10,754
But don't worry. Nobody's gonna focus
on that if you wear that towel-dress.

3
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:13,613
Tell him.

4
00:00:13,825 --> 00:00:18,091
lt's her first day at this new job.
You're not supposed to start with her.

5
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:21,589
All right, l suppose l can wait a day.

6
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:24,531
-What are you doing Friday?
-Why?

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,534
l need you at a bachelor party
for my weird cousin, Albert.

8
00:00:27,706 --> 00:00:29,469
You know, he's the botanist?

9
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:30,938
Oh, God!

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,168
Botanists are such geeks.

11
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:36,244
ls that a dinosaur tie?

12
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:43,279
Morning!

13
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:46,089
Rach, l'm here with the purses!

14
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,421
lt must take you forever
to find your keys.

15
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:52,194
Thank you, Pheebs.

16
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:55,366
You're welcome. Please want
the one with the turtles.

17
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:58,162
No, turtles scare me.
l don't need that today.

18
00:00:59,504 --> 00:01:02,064
Honey, just relax.
lt's gonna be fine.

19
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:04,935
Why don't l come down there,
and l'll take you to lunch?

20
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,772
Honey, thank you!
But Mark's taking me out.

21
00:01:08,747 --> 00:01:11,944
Mark? ls that the same Mark
that helped you get the job?

22
00:01:12,117 --> 00:01:15,553
Yeah, it's kind of like a ''good luck
on your first day'' sort of thing.

23
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:16,949
ls this a lunch box?

24
00:01:17,923 --> 00:01:20,414
No, it's a purse.
And there's a thermos in it.

25
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:25,461
-So can you make it on Friday?
-What?

26
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:28,259
Yeah, l think so.
Why am l invited to this again?

27
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:30,060
Apparently, Albert has no friends.

28
00:01:30,268 --> 00:01:32,236
He's very excited about
the bachelor party.

29
00:01:32,437 --> 00:01:35,770
l think, actually, he's only getting
married so he can see a stripper.

30
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:40,967
A stripper at a bachelor party.
That is so clichê.

31
00:01:41,246 --> 00:01:43,908
Why don't you guys get a magician?

32
00:01:44,616 --> 00:01:48,416
Well, if a magician can open my beer
with his butt cheeks, then all right.

33
00:01:51,223 --> 00:01:52,247
The One With All the Jealousy

34
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:40,997
She's having lunch with him?
Lunch with him?

35
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:43,971
You should've seen the hug he gave her
when she got the job!

36
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:47,076
And he's really good-looking.

37
00:02:48,313 --> 00:02:50,747
-What am l gonna do?
-You don't do anything.

38
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:53,574
Keep it inside.
Learn how to hide your feelings.

39
00:02:55,454 --> 00:02:56,512
Don't cry out loud.

40
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:02,791
Guess who has an audition
for a Broadway musical?

41
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:06,488
l wanna say you, but it seems like
such an easy answer.

42
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:10,899
lt is me! lt's a musical version
of A Tale of Two Cities.

43
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:14,628
So l think l'm gonna sing
''New York, New York'' ...

44
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:17,569
...and ''l Left My Heart
in San Francisco.''

45
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:23,976
Joey, l don't think
you get to pick the cities.

46
00:03:24,716 --> 00:03:27,844
-What?
-Mr. Dickens gets to pick them.

47
00:03:29,588 --> 00:03:31,920
Who?

48
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,990
l'll get you the Cliff Notes.

49
00:03:34,326 --> 00:03:37,693
-The what?
-The abridgment.

50
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:40,926
Okay.

51
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:43,262
The what?

52
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,997
Then the style number...

53
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:53,670
...the invoice number
and the shipping date.

54
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:55,870
Good. Any questions so far?

55
00:03:56,414 --> 00:03:58,075
What kind of discount do we get?

56
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:03,081
-Twenty percent.
-l love this job!

57
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:06,720
-My first call!
-Here, let me.

58
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:09,524
Rachel Greene's line.
How may l help you?

59
00:04:09,694 --> 00:04:10,956
Hi, is Rachel there?

60
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:14,121
-And who may l say is calling?
-This is Ross.

61
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:15,357
Ross of...?

62
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:18,795
Of Ross and Rachel.

63
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,131
Hi, it's Mark.

64
00:04:21,306 --> 00:04:23,240
-Hey, Mark.
-Hey.

65
00:04:23,475 --> 00:04:26,239
Hold on a second.
It's Ross.

66
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:28,676
-Hi, honey.
-Hi.

67
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:31,447
What's Mark doing
answering your phone?

68
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:33,445
Oh, he's just goofing around.

69
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:36,710
Oh, that's funny.

70
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:40,815
Why isn't he goofing around
in his own office?

71
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:45,088
This is his office too. l told you,
we're Joanna's two assistants.

72
00:04:45,697 --> 00:04:47,528
Why does Joanna need two assistants?

73
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,824
How lazy is she?

74
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:53,130
Oh, my God! What did l just do?

75
00:04:53,338 --> 00:04:55,533
l think l just shipped 3000 bras
to Personnel!

76
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:57,469
Honey, l gotta go!
Mark, l need you!

77
00:04:57,642 --> 00:04:59,974
Okay! Bye-bye!

78
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:03,007
Ross!

79
00:05:03,181 --> 00:05:05,706
l'm sorry, sweetie.
l was just trying to--

80
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:07,884
l was dialing another number.

81
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:25,130
All right, l just got changed in 30
seconds so you could be alone with him.

82
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:26,565
You better go for it.

83
00:05:26,738 --> 00:05:28,831
Please. l'm not going for anything.

84
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:30,474
Well, if you don't, l will.

85
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:32,370
Would you please go?

86
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:34,912
'Night, Mon.

87
00:05:36,214 --> 00:05:38,239
'Night, Julio.

88
00:05:49,027 --> 00:05:50,756
Julio, someone left their book here.

89
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,494
Actually, that is mine.

90
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,497
What are you reading?

91
00:05:56,768 --> 00:06:01,171
Flowers of Evil, by Baudelaire.
Have you read it?

92
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:02,897
Have l read it?

93
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:06,434
No. Are you enjoying it?

94
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:10,744
l thought that l would,
but the translation's no good.

95
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,847
You're a poet,
and you don't know it.

96
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:19,417
Actually, l....

97
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:20,986
l am a poet.

98
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:25,620
So you do know it.

99
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:34,062
So, what kind of things
do you write about?

100
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:36,270
Things that move me:

101
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:38,709
The shadow of a tree...

102
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:41,006
...a child laughing...

103
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:44,140
...or this lip.

104
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:45,805
Mine?

105
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:47,944
Right here?

106
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:54,055
l could write an epic poem
about this lip.

107
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:01,926
How would that go?

108
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:14,905
Well, it didn't rhyme...

109
00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:16,137
...but l liked it.

110
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:36,798
Lovely.

111
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:38,230
Just lovely.

112
00:07:38,603 --> 00:07:40,002
Really? Thanks.

113
00:07:40,171 --> 00:07:43,698
Listen, Joey. We definitely want
to see you for the callback on Saturday.

114
00:07:44,109 --> 00:07:45,167
Excellent!

115
00:07:45,944 --> 00:07:47,002
-l'll be there.
-Okay.

116
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:50,714
And listen, don't forget to bring
your jazz shoes for the dance audition.

117
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:58,222
My agent said that
it wasn't a dancing part.

118
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,188
Joey, all the roles gotta dance a little.

119
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:04,587
Believe me, with your dance background,
it'll be a piece of cake.

120
00:08:04,763 --> 00:08:08,062
''Three years of modern dance
with Twyla Tharp''?

121
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:12,000
''Five years with
the American Ballet Theatre''?

122
00:08:14,205 --> 00:08:17,504
Hey, everybody lies
on their rêsumê, okay?

123
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:20,143
l wasn't one of
the Zoom kids either.

124
00:08:21,146 --> 00:08:23,410
Well, can you, like, dance at all?

125
00:08:23,648 --> 00:08:25,741
Yeah, l can dance.
You know....

126
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:37,094
Oh, no, no, no, no.

127
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:39,791
What is that?

128
00:08:40,265 --> 00:08:43,894
Sure, it looks stupid now.
There's no music playing.

129
00:08:44,602 --> 00:08:46,832
l have to get that.
But, no, no.

130
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:51,972
Hello. Hi.

131
00:08:52,577 --> 00:08:58,015
Yeah, listen, l'm in need of a stripper,
and l was told that you do that.

132
00:09:01,286 --> 00:09:04,881
Let me ask you this. What do you do
for the extra hundred?

133
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:09,583
So would l have to provide the grapes?

134
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:11,217
Hi.

135
00:09:11,863 --> 00:09:13,956
How was last night
with Julio, señorita?

136
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:18,760
lt so was amazing. He's so sexy and
smart, which makes him even sexier.

137
00:09:18,937 --> 00:09:21,701
l gotta tell you this. Last night,
we were fooling around...

138
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:24,865
...and all of a sudden he stops
to write a poem.

139
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,646
Get out! l couldn't stop
if a meteor hit me.

140
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:35,714
Okay, we have our stripper,
a Miss Crystal Chandelier.

141
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:39,323
Sure, you name a kid that, what do you
expect them to grow up to be?

142
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:44,422
Anyway, when he left, he forgot
to take the poem with him.

143
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:49,190
Now, l am totally dense about poetry,
but l think this is pretty good.

144
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:52,336
Check it out. Read it.

145
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:55,898
''The Empty Vase.''
Translucent beauty--

146
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:57,302
To yourself.

147
00:10:01,546 --> 00:10:03,138
You know what? That's pretty good.

148
00:10:03,314 --> 00:10:04,679
Good. l think so too.
Phoebe?

149
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:05,975
Yeah.

150
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:07,982
Great! l'm so glad you guys like it!

151
00:10:08,153 --> 00:10:10,917
-All right, l gotta go to work.
-Hold on. l'm not done.

152
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:13,514
All right, give it back when
you're through.

153
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,257
-See you guys.
-Bye-bye.

154
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:19,160
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Poor Monica!

155
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,763
What? What? What?

156
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:23,833
What? He was with her
when he wrote this poem!

157
00:10:24,002 --> 00:10:27,369
Look! My vessel so lovely,
with nothing inside?

158
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:30,303
Now that I've touched you,
you seem emptier still?

159
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:33,602
He thinks Monica's empty.
She's the empty vase!

160
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:36,008
-Vase, vase?
-Monica's not an empty vase.

161
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:38,172
You think vase?

162
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,514
-You really think that's what he meant?
-Totally.

163
00:10:41,686 --> 00:10:44,280
Oh, God!
And she seems so happy too.

164
00:10:44,923 --> 00:10:46,481
Done.

165
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:49,081
What happened?

166
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,455
Joey, what do you think
this poem means?

167
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:53,490
Monica's the vase, right?

168
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,733
You are such a mystery to me.

169
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:10,745
Do you have the Ralph Lauren file?

170
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:14,646
Oh, yeah, sure! lt's right....

171
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:19,985
What's that?

172
00:11:20,158 --> 00:11:22,422
lt's from Ross. lt's a Love Bug.

173
00:11:23,895 --> 00:11:27,422
Somebody wants people to know
you have a boyfriend.

174
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:30,568
No, that's not what he's doing.

175
00:11:30,735 --> 00:11:32,066
He's just really romantic.

176
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:36,171
-Excuse me. Are you Rachel Greene?
-Yes.

177
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:39,532
One, two, three.

178
00:11:39,711 --> 00:11:42,680
Congratulations on your first week
At your brand-new job

179
00:11:43,348 --> 00:11:45,475
It won't be long
Before you're the boss

180
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:49,511
And you know who will be there
To support you

181
00:11:49,754 --> 00:11:51,085
Your one and only boyfriend

182
00:11:51,356 --> 00:11:52,846
lt's nice to have a boyfriend!

183
00:11:53,091 --> 00:11:56,993
Your loyal, loving boyfriend, Ross!

184
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,165
l'm hurt!
l'm actually hurt...

185
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:12,366
...that you'd think l'd send you any of
those things out of anything but love.

186
00:12:12,543 --> 00:12:14,738
Hurt! Hurt!

187
00:12:14,912 --> 00:12:17,540
All right, Ross. l get it. You're hurt!

188
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:19,910
Can't a guy send
a barbershop quartet...

189
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:23,120
...to his girlfriend's office anymore?

190
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:27,217
Oh, please!
Ross, it was so obvious.

191
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:29,825
lt was like you were
marking your territory.

192
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:34,225
You might as well have just come in
and peed all around my desk!

193
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:37,826
l would never do that.

194
00:12:40,238 --> 00:12:42,297
Look, l know what's going
on here, okay?

195
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:46,841
Mark explained it all to me.
He said this is what you guys do.

196
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:50,845
Yeah, well, if Mark said that,
then Mark's an idiot.

197
00:12:51,015 --> 00:12:52,346
Mark's a genius.

198
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:54,576
Why? How?
How is he a genius?

199
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:56,513
Don't you see what's happening here?

200
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:59,851
lnstead of hitting on her right away,
he's becoming her confidante.

201
00:13:00,024 --> 00:13:04,324
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes to,
to complain about you.

202
00:13:06,764 --> 00:13:07,753
You okay over there?

203
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:11,490
l tried taking a dance class today
to get ready for this callback tomorrow.

204
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:14,536
-How'd it go?
-Knocked over a girl.

205
00:13:15,506 --> 00:13:18,737
Good work. Can we get back to the
Mark thing? What am l gonna do?

206
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,844
Why don't you send her a musical bug?

207
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:22,309
No, you already did that.

208
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,044
All right, you're gonna have
to go there yourself now.

209
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:31,117
-Make a few surprise visits.
-l don't know, you guys.

210
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:33,620
Fine, don't do anything.
Just sit and talk to us.

211
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:36,486
Meanwhile, she is talking
to him about you.

212
00:13:36,661 --> 00:13:38,288
And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive.

213
00:13:38,463 --> 00:13:42,559
She starts thinking, ''Maybe this is the
guy for me because he understands me.''

214
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:44,827
And before you know it,
she's with him.

215
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:48,165
And you'll be all, ''Oh, man!''

216
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:50,102
And he'll be all, ''Yes!''

217
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:54,937
And us, we'll be like, ''Oh, dude!''

218
00:13:56,948 --> 00:13:59,473
And pretty soon you'll be like:

219
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,244
''Hi.''

220
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,016
And, ''Well, l can't go.
Rachel and Mark might be there.''

221
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:10,790
And we'll be like, ''Man, get over it!
lt's been four years!''

222
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:16,560
He paints quite a picture, doesn't he?

223
00:14:19,604 --> 00:14:21,936
Here's the Shelley Segal stuff
for December.

224
00:14:22,106 --> 00:14:24,540
Wait, l've got something for you.

225
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:27,109
-Mark.
-lt's okay. Rachel knows.

226
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:29,245
Yeah, but even so.

227
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,774
l can't help it.
l'm just crazy about you.

228
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,019
Oh, that is so sweet!

229
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:40,949
l know l'm Mr. lnappropriate today,
but it's just so tough.

230
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:44,424
l mean, l see you walking around,
and l want to touch you and hold you.

231
00:14:44,962 --> 00:14:47,396
Come on, no one's around.
Just kiss me.

232
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:49,795
All right, that's it!
Get off of her!

233
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:51,161
What is going on?

234
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:54,168
What's going on?
l'll tell you what's going on!

235
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:56,272
Ross!

236
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:05,307
l have been down in your store
for 20 minutes, trying to get a tie.

237
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:09,910
What do l have to do
to get some service?

238
00:15:12,056 --> 00:15:13,956
Hi, Rach.

239
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:25,696
Joey? Joey Tribbiani?

240
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,971
Joey, l've got a problem.

241
00:15:31,242 --> 00:15:33,301
l just got a call
from my dance captain.

242
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:36,638
He's having a relationship crisis
and can't get out of Long lsland.

243
00:15:36,814 --> 00:15:38,941
So does that mean the audition's off?

244
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,517
Listen, Joey. Seeing as you've got
the most experience...

245
00:15:42,687 --> 00:15:45,747
...l want you to take these dancers
and teach them the combination.

246
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:49,049
What?

247
00:15:49,227 --> 00:15:53,129
Joey, come on. lt's easy.
You know, it's hand, hand...

248
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:55,060
...head, head...

249
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:59,795
...up, pas de bourrêe, pas de bourrêe,
big turn here, rond de jambe.

250
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:02,096
Slide, step, step...

251
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:04,935
...and jazz hands!

252
00:16:07,044 --> 00:16:10,605
lt's steppity-step and jazz hands.

253
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:12,210
Have fun.

254
00:16:13,017 --> 00:16:14,882
Bye.

255
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:19,320
-Hey.
-Hey.

256
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,889
What are you wrapping?

257
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:23,520
Look what l got Julio.

258
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:27,958
Yeah, it's a vase.

259
00:16:28,132 --> 00:16:31,067
Yeah, just like the one in the poem.

260
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:33,760
Not exactly like
the one in the poem.

261
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:35,895
What do you mean?

262
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:39,342
Remember how you said you were
really dense about poetry?

263
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:48,010
So l'm just an empty vase?

264
00:16:48,219 --> 00:16:49,777
What?

265
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:52,445
So, l don't read as many
important books as you do.

266
00:16:52,623 --> 00:16:57,083
And l don't write trick poems
that aren't actually what they seem.

267
00:16:57,261 --> 00:16:59,786
And you know what?
l get excited about stupid stuff...

268
00:16:59,964 --> 00:17:02,364
...like when my People magazine
comes on Saturday...

269
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:05,263
...and the new
Hold Everything catalog.

270
00:17:05,469 --> 00:17:09,735
But that doesn't mean l'm empty. l care
about things, like friends and family.

271
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:13,866
You have no right to make that kind of
judgment! You don't even know me!

272
00:17:14,478 --> 00:17:16,571
The poem is not about you.

273
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:21,745
-What?
-''The Empty Vase'' is not about you.

274
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:26,447
My baby preciosa, you make me so sad
that you would think this.

275
00:17:29,427 --> 00:17:31,918
l'm sorry. lt's....
My friend Phoebe said--

276
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:35,554
No, it's....
lt's about all women.

277
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:40,500
Well, all American women.

278
00:17:42,473 --> 00:17:43,735
You feel better now?

279
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,970
All right, let's do it.

280
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:12,863
What was that?

281
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:16,172
l know. lt's the best
l could get out of them.

282
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,342
Well, people!

283
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,703
People, people, people!

284
00:18:22,213 --> 00:18:27,082
Let's try it again. And this time,
let's everybody watch Joey.

285
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:30,143
Show them how it's done.

286
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,151
Count it off, Mack.

287
00:18:49,974 --> 00:18:52,670
Did you have fun at
the bachelor party last night?

288
00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:55,869
Yeah, look what l got!
See, she's fully dressed, right?

289
00:18:56,147 --> 00:18:59,548
And then you click it,
and she's naked!

290
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:04,014
And then you click it again,
and she's dressed.

291
00:19:04,188 --> 00:19:06,554
She's a business woman,
walking down the street.

292
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:09,352
She's window shopping,
and she's naked!

293
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:18,059
Hi.

294
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:20,464
Hello.

295
00:19:21,405 --> 00:19:24,238
You know what? l'm gonna spend
some alone time with the pen.

296
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:36,046
l'm sorry. l was an idiot.

297
00:19:36,587 --> 00:19:37,952
A big idiot.

298
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:39,588
A big idiot.

299
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:45,352
lt's just you have to realize this whole
Mark thing is really hard for me.

300
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:49,297
Honey, why is it hard? We've
been together for almost a year now.

301
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:52,769
Well, l was with Carol
for, like, eight years.

302
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:55,428
And l lost her.

303
00:19:56,607 --> 00:19:59,576
And now, if it's possible,
l think l love you even more.

304
00:20:00,478 --> 00:20:03,379
So it's hard for me
to believe l'm not gonna...

305
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:07,381
...well, that someone else isn't
gonna take you away.

306
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,247
Let it be me. Let it be me!

307
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:18,551
Honey, that's very sweet.

308
00:20:18,763 --> 00:20:22,597
lt just seems to me, though,
that if two people love each other...

309
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,268
...and trust each other, like we do...

310
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:27,596
...there's no reason to be jealous.

311
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:37,981
l gotta get going.
Bye, Chandler.

312
00:20:38,516 --> 00:20:43,283
Okay, Ross, this pen's getting kind of
boring. Can you pick me up some porn?

313
00:20:46,257 --> 00:20:47,246
Where you going?

314
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:50,222
l've gotta go pick up Ben.
We got a play-date this afternoon.

315
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:52,020
With who?

316
00:20:52,263 --> 00:20:54,823
Just this woman l met
last night at the party.

317
00:20:55,032 --> 00:20:56,761
There was a woman at--?

318
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,262
The stripper?

319
00:21:01,472 --> 00:21:05,465
-Yeah.
-You have a play-date with a stripper?

320
00:21:06,777 --> 00:21:08,642
Man, l gotta get a kid!

321
00:21:15,486 --> 00:21:19,479
Yeah, we started talking
after she did her thing...

322
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:22,057
...and it turns out she's got a boy
about Ben's age.

323
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:25,320
So we're gonna take the kids
to a Gymboree class.

324
00:21:25,996 --> 00:21:28,055
-ls that okay?
-Sure. ls she married?

325
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:30,096
No.

326
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:36,495
Are you jealous?

327
00:21:37,842 --> 00:21:41,710
No, l just don't see why she has
to play with you. That's all.

328
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:47,476
l mean, doesn't she, you know, have any
other stripper-mom friends of her own?

329
00:21:50,354 --> 00:21:52,549
You are totally jealous!

330
00:21:53,023 --> 00:21:56,220
l'm not jealous, all right.
This is about...

331
00:21:58,095 --> 00:22:01,223
...people feeling certain things...

332
00:22:01,498 --> 00:22:03,056
...you know, about...

333
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:07,032
...strippers. And, you know....

334
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:08,431
l love you too.

335
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:09,928
Bye.

336
00:22:10,374 --> 00:22:11,773
Wait, wait, wait!

337
00:22:11,942 --> 00:22:13,637
What?

338
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,724
Well, there's a kiss he won't forget
for a few hours.

339
00:22:30,394 --> 00:22:34,763
Either that or you just turned him on
and sent him to a stripper.

340
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:41,137
All right, l'm jealous.
l'm jealous!

''Oh, no. Chandler, please don't.
No, l beg of you to not--''

342
00:22:50,147 --> 00:22:52,638
ls there a Julio here?

Mr. Pretentious

345
00:22:58,322 --> 00:23:01,223
You think there's no one finer
Your poems are unpublished

346
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,388
And you work in a diner

347
00:23:03,627 --> 00:23:08,030
You're no God's gift to women
That's all in your head

348
00:23:08,632 --> 00:23:11,294
-You are just a butt-munch
-No one likes a butt-munch!

349
00:23:11,468 --> 00:23:15,700
And you're also bad in bed
