1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,709
- Hey.
- Hi.

2
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:08,375
Pheebs, what's wrong?

3
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:12,081
I'm just so exhausted from dragging
around this huge engagement ring.

4
00:00:12,257 --> 00:00:15,021
- Oh, my God.
- Congratulations.

5
00:00:15,193 --> 00:00:18,219
So did he get on one knee?
Did he have a speech prepared?

6
00:00:18,397 --> 00:00:20,160
Oh, did he cry?

7
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:25,497
Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals.

8
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:30,436
Well, it was really sweet,
and, like, the most romantic thing ever.

9
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:33,908
Here's to Phoebe, who's found
the greatest guy in the world.

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,239
To Phoebe and--

11
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:37,678
I want to say "Mike"?

12
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:40,607
- To Phoebe and Mike.
- Hey.

13
00:00:40,786 --> 00:00:43,448
Thank you. Oh, and I have
something for you.

14
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:47,285
It's my little black book. It's got
the numbers of all the guys I've dated.

15
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:51,862
Oh, Phoebe, that's nice,
but you know what? I think I'm okay.

16
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,191
Give it to one
of your other single girlfriends.

17
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:56,630
I would, but you're the last one.

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,335
Give me the book!

19
00:01:01,473 --> 00:01:03,338
"Pablo Diaz.

20
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:05,339
Brady Smith.

21
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:07,940
Guy in Van"?

22
00:01:08,113 --> 00:01:10,013
Oh, my first love.

23
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:14,681
What is the red X next
to Bob Gremore's name mean?

24
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:16,787
Dead.

25
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,448
Oh, it's okay. No, he was old. Yeah.

26
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:25,723
And he lived a full life. He was
in the first wave at Omaha Beach.

27
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:29,298
I should've given you guys
my black book when I got married.

28
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:32,164
Although, it wasn't so much
a book as a napkin.

29
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:35,831
With Janice's phone number on it.

30
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,708
Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?

31
00:01:43,949 --> 00:01:45,473
Oh, yes, they are.

32
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:37,693
Hey, honey.

33
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:40,027
Hey, sweetie.

34
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,300
- Is Monica not here?
- No.

35
00:02:42,474 --> 00:02:46,240
Then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding
for a big account, and they got it.

36
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:48,845
- It's my first national commercial.
- Cool.

37
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:52,040
And I don't want to brag,
but a lot of the ideas were mine.

38
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:55,516
Hell, you weren't there.
All the ideas were mine.

39
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:58,952
That's great.
Hey, can you cast me in it?

40
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:02,218
I really don't think
you're right for the part.

41
00:03:02,394 --> 00:03:06,091
What do you mean?
I can do anything. I'm a chameleon.

42
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:09,400
I'm old.

43
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:12,731
I'm tired.

44
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:17,739
Oh, I am hot. I'm cold.
Come on, what can't I do?

45
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,174
First of all, bravo.

46
00:03:22,147 --> 00:03:26,083
But I don't think you're right for this.
The part's a stuffy college professor.

47
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:30,244
I can do that. Hello, I'm your professor.

48
00:03:30,422 --> 00:03:34,916
When I'm not busy thinking
of important things, or professing...

49
00:03:36,261 --> 00:03:38,252
...l like to use-- What's the product?

50
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,093
Software that facilitates
inter-business networking e-solutions.

51
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,401
I'm cold.

52
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:53,167
- Hey.
- Hey.

53
00:03:53,345 --> 00:03:55,836
Guess who's a finalist
for a huge research grant?

54
00:03:56,014 --> 00:03:58,710
I'll give you a hint.
He's looking right at you.

55
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:02,581
Well, unless it's the creepy guy
with his hand up his kilt...

56
00:04:02,754 --> 00:04:05,279
...I'm gonna say, "Congratulations."

57
00:04:05,457 --> 00:04:09,985
I'm so excited. Apparently, I beat out
hundreds of other applicants...

58
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:12,824
...including five guys
I went to graduate school with.

59
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:15,967
Not that I'm keeping score,
or anything. Five.

60
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:18,529
- Wow, that's great.
- Yeah.

61
00:04:18,703 --> 00:04:21,934
- So tell me about the grant.
- Well, okay, it's for $25,000.

62
00:04:22,107 --> 00:04:25,304
And if I get it, I'll be able
to complete my field research.

63
00:04:25,477 --> 00:04:29,345
And there will be an article about me
in the <i>Paleontology Review</i>.

64
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:31,812
It'll be the first time
my name is in there...

65
00:04:31,983 --> 00:04:34,816
...without people raising
serious questions about my work.

66
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:39,017
- Are you talking about the Dewer Grant?
- Yeah. Why?

67
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:41,352
Benjamin Hobart
is administering that grant.

68
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:43,653
- Your ex-boyfriend?
- Yeah.

69
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:48,232
So your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine
if your new boyfriend gets this grant?

70
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,267
Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed.

71
00:04:51,436 --> 00:04:53,768
No. No, we ended on great terms.

72
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:56,874
If anything, I think this could
help you. You know what?

73
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:59,909
Why don't we all go out to dinner,
and I can introduce you.

74
00:05:00,078 --> 00:05:02,979
- If you think it'd help.
- Yeah, absolutely. I'll call him.

75
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:05,878
Now, is there anything
I could do to butter him up?

76
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:07,575
Anything he really likes?

77
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:11,248
He does have
a pretty serious latex fetish.

78
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:14,051
We'll see how dinner goes.

79
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:20,589
- Hey.
- Hey, you want to go see a movie?

80
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:24,360
I told you I had to spend all day
clearing out stuff so Mike could move in.

81
00:05:24,536 --> 00:05:26,060
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.

82
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:30,732
Now that I'm here, I might as well help
with the cleaning and organizing.

83
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:32,968
I just happen to have my label maker.

84
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:37,247
Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff.

85
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:40,680
Did you and Chandler make compromises
when you moved in together?

86
00:05:41,052 --> 00:05:42,542
Chandler did.

87
00:05:43,555 --> 00:05:45,989
- What does he want you to give up?
- A bunch of stuff.

88
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:49,388
And the worst one,
he wants me to get rid of Gladys.

89
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:51,785
Who's Gladys?

90
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:57,632
What a tragic loss.

91
00:05:58,236 --> 00:06:02,673
Yeah, I really hate to give her up.
Oh, I know. Oh, you should take her.

92
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:08,570
I don't know.

93
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:14,379
- What, you don't like her?
- Of course I do. What's not to like?

94
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,486
I'd take her in a minute.

95
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:19,783
But I think that you're
giving up too easy.

96
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,552
Honey, I think that you need
to fight for her.

97
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:25,556
- Really, you think?
- Absolutely.

98
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,722
You say to him, "I'm sorry, Mike,
I can't live without her.

99
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,061
She means too much to me."

100
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:34,770
Okay, I'll fight for her. Okay.

101
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,467
Oh, wait. I just realized, if I do that,
that means you don't get her.

102
00:06:38,643 --> 00:06:40,611
Damn it, I did not think this through.

103
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:47,982
Emma, mom's got a snack for you.

104
00:06:53,725 --> 00:06:57,354
You know, every now and then,
she might like some barbecue potato chips.

105
00:06:59,264 --> 00:07:00,959
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

106
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:02,463
- Hi.
- Hey, baby.

107
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:04,499
Oh, any word on casting yet?

108
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:07,832
- I told you, you're not right for the part.
- What do you mean?

109
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:12,170
Rach, don't I seem like a professor
you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?

110
00:07:13,244 --> 00:07:16,839
I'm sorry, this sounds like something
I'm never gonna be interested in.

111
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:21,918
Look, come on, please? It's not like
I'm asking you for some crazy favor.

112
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:24,954
This is what I do for a living.
I am a professional actor.

113
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:27,091
Man, I'm two hours late for work.

114
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,225
Here's my reel. It's got all
the commercials that I've been in.

115
00:07:32,397 --> 00:07:34,024
- Joe--
- Just watch it.

116
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,997
If you don't like it,
don't pass it on to your bosses.

117
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:40,069
- Fine.
- Thank you.

118
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:46,840
- Work, Joe.
- Damn it.

119
00:07:50,048 --> 00:07:52,539
- What am I gonna do now?
- Just pass the tape along.

120
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:54,548
He's not right for the part.

121
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:57,187
If I suggest him,
my bosses will think I'm an idiot.

122
00:07:57,355 --> 00:07:59,983
And that's something
they should learn on their own.

123
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:02,388
Just tell Joey
that you watched the tape...

124
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,551
...and you liked it,
but your bosses didn't.

125
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:07,163
Then you're the good guy,
and they're the bad guy.

126
00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:10,233
That's good. I liked it, they didn't.

127
00:08:12,103 --> 00:08:14,765
Joey, for God's sake, go to work.

128
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:23,011
I can't believe I'm about
to meet Benjamin Hobart.

129
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:25,615
I've always thought of him
as someone I'd invite...

130
00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:28,275
...to my fantasy dinner party.

131
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,883
Do you think there's any chance
he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C-3PO?

132
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:37,120
Sorry, it looks like it's just him.

133
00:08:38,897 --> 00:08:40,364
Charlie.

134
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,500
My God, you look absolutely stunning.

135
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:49,799
Well, I am having a good hair day.

136
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:54,408
- It's so good to see you.
- Oh, you too.

137
00:08:58,016 --> 00:08:59,381
I'm okay.

138
00:09:00,251 --> 00:09:03,584
I'm sorry. Ross Geller,
Benjamin Hobart.

139
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:06,883
It's an honor to meet you.
I can't tell you how long...

140
00:09:07,058 --> 00:09:11,995
...I've been an admirer of your work.
I mean, that Nobel Prize.

141
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:17,795
I mean, I have to tell you that you're
one of the reasons I got into the field.

142
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:19,859
Well, likewise.

143
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:24,004
Not likewise. I'd never heard
of you until this morning.

144
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:25,767
But it's nice to be nice.

145
00:09:27,846 --> 00:09:31,475
- Shall we?
- Yeah. Thank you.

146
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:37,544
I can't believe that you chose
this restaurant.

147
00:09:37,722 --> 00:09:41,783
- Do you remember the night?
- Oh, my God. I completely forgot.

148
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,262
Oh, my God, I can't believe
they let us back in this place.

149
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:56,604
You weren't there.

150
00:09:57,275 --> 00:10:00,472
No, but, you know,
it's just a funny image.

151
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:06,106
You know, the two of you
in this restaurant with the....

152
00:10:07,752 --> 00:10:12,849
Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your
proposal while I go to the ladies' room.

153
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,420
So tell me about it.

154
00:10:16,594 --> 00:10:21,031
Okay. Well, I would like to do
a dig in the Painted Desert.

155
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:24,396
There are still several areas
that haven't been fully excavated.

156
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:25,900
- Break up with Charlie.
- What?

157
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,435
What?

158
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,670
Did you just say,
"Break up with Charlie"?

159
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:39,149
Well, yes and no. Yes, I did say it.
And no, I didn't not say it.

160
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:44,087
- Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
- Listen, I'm sorry.

161
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:47,850
I just haven't seen her for so long,
all these feelings are rushing back.

162
00:10:48,026 --> 00:10:50,358
I'm starting to realize
how much I've missed her.

163
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:52,928
And I'm gonna need you
to break up with her.

164
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:57,728
- Are you serious?
- If you say, yes, then I'm serious.

165
00:10:57,902 --> 00:11:00,200
If you say, no, then I'm joking.

166
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:03,439
- No.
- Joking it is.

167
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:10,446
- Hi, sorry I'm late.
- Hey, how'd it go with Mike?

168
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:14,551
- Is he gonna let you keep the painting?
- No, he really hates it.

169
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:17,620
But he's gonna let me keep
my box of human hair.

170
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:24,260
So you gotta pick your battles.
But the good news is, Gladys is yours.

171
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,521
Wow, what's the bad news?

172
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,165
- Who's Gladys?
- Oh, she's that work of art I made.

173
00:11:32,337 --> 00:11:35,067
You know, with the woman
coming out of the frame.

174
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,706
And Monica gets to keep her?

175
00:11:39,877 --> 00:11:43,074
In her house? I am so jealous.

176
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,051
I didn't know you wanted her too.

177
00:11:49,187 --> 00:11:52,623
Well, I mean, sure, of course.

178
00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:55,285
But you already gave that
to Monica, so....

179
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,260
- You know, I would give her up for you.
- No, I couldn't let you do that.

180
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,762
- No, but I want to.
- But I don't want you to.

181
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:05,869
- But I insist.
- But I insist harder.

182
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:09,970
Girls. Girls. Stop.
Okay, we'll flip a coin.

183
00:12:10,141 --> 00:12:13,338
Heads, she's Rachel's.
Tails, she's Monica's.

184
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,614
- Tails. Monica, she's yours.
- No, that landed in your food.

185
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:24,748
No, no, that's okay.
You won fair and square. I'm so sad.

186
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:31,254
Then the little red squirrel
took all of his acorns...

187
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:35,422
...and put them in his little satchel
and set off for--

188
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:39,493
Okay. Someone's getting a little fussy.
I think it's time for bed.

189
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:42,539
Where's the little red squirrel going?

190
00:12:47,345 --> 00:12:49,040
Hey, Joe?

191
00:12:53,718 --> 00:12:55,777
Oh, that's so sweet.

192
00:12:57,722 --> 00:12:59,019
- What's up?
- Bad news.

193
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:04,025
I watched the tape and passed it along
to my bosses and they weren't interested.

194
00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:07,858
I'm sorry, man.

195
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:13,231
- But you watched the tape?
- Yeah, I liked it.

196
00:13:14,405 --> 00:13:20,173
But my bosses didn't go for it.
Stupid sons of bitches.

197
00:13:24,515 --> 00:13:29,111
- You didn't watch the tape.
- What? Of course I did.

198
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:32,120
Look, it's one thing not to cast me,
but to lie to me?

199
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,418
- I'm not lying to you. I watched it.
- You lied again.

200
00:13:35,593 --> 00:13:38,721
- I watched it.
- Keep going, Pinocchio.

201
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:41,796
- I did.
- No, you didn't.

202
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:44,025
I'm telling you, I watched the tape.

203
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:48,733
- Did you watch the tape?
- No.

204
00:13:53,311 --> 00:13:57,077
Hi. Look, I realize only one of us
can get this grant.

205
00:13:57,248 --> 00:14:00,547
And I just wanted to wish
both of you the best of luck.

206
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:02,709
Are you crossing your fingers?

207
00:14:03,988 --> 00:14:09,949
What, this? No. This-- That's just
the result of a childhood injury.

208
00:14:10,828 --> 00:14:13,262
I'm cured!

209
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:16,725
Good morning, everybody.

210
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:19,426
If you go ahead and take your seats
we can get started.

211
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:22,364
Actually, Dr. Hobart,
can I have a word with you?

212
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,405
And you are?

213
00:14:25,877 --> 00:14:28,004
- Ross.
- I know. I'm kidding.

214
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:32,978
Listen, I just want to say, last night--

215
00:14:33,151 --> 00:14:35,210
Dinner was a little awkward.

216
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:38,549
- I just wanna make sure we're okay.
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

217
00:14:38,723 --> 00:14:41,920
- You didn't tell Charlie what I said, did you?
- Oh, no. Of course not.

218
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:47,356
Well, thank you. I want you to know,
I respect your decision not to give her up.

219
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:50,160
It was the biggest mistake
I ever made in my whole life.

220
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:53,929
Well, that and tattooing
her name on my shoulder...

221
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:57,132
...last night stupidly.

222
00:14:58,276 --> 00:14:59,265
Seriously?

223
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:03,005
My Nobel Prize was not for moving on.

224
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:07,278
- So no hard feelings?
- None at all. Good luck today.

225
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:09,113
- Thank you.
- Okay.

226
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:14,054
All right. The selection committee
has chosen the three of you as our finalists.

227
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:19,162
The ultimate decision will be based on the
answers you give to the questions I ask.

228
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,594
We're gonna go ahead
and start with Dr. Li.

229
00:15:21,766 --> 00:15:25,930
You claim the field is too reliant
on the Linnaean taxonomic system.

230
00:15:26,103 --> 00:15:28,264
How do you propose
to correct this problem?

231
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:31,567
Well, I believe that the answers lie
in the osteological evidence.

232
00:15:31,742 --> 00:15:33,607
- I plan to begin there.
- Interesting.

233
00:15:34,045 --> 00:15:35,774
I guess.

234
00:15:36,747 --> 00:15:40,683
Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some
fieldwork. Where might that take place?

235
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:43,548
Primarily in the Pierre Shale region
of South Dakota.

236
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:48,158
Certainly. Very well.
And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?

237
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:56,365
What? I--

238
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:00,530
Care to venture a guess?

239
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,067
- May 12?
- That's not even kind of close.

240
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,513
Dr. Li, how many
graduate students will you need?

241
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:12,615
- Half a dozen.
- I see. And Dr. Biely?

242
00:16:12,783 --> 00:16:15,081
Three for excavation,
and two for analysis.

243
00:16:15,253 --> 00:16:19,314
Certainly. Dr. Geller,
which 1965 Shirelles hit...

244
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,516
...was later covered by
a popular British lnvasion band?

245
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:28,688
What? I need six graduate students.

246
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:32,666
No, I'm sorry.
We were looking for "Baby It's You."

247
00:16:32,837 --> 00:16:34,202
"Baby It's You."

248
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,138
What? Wait just a minute.

249
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:41,472
None of my questions have anything
to do with paleontology.

250
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:44,114
You're right, I apologize.
Scratch the last question.

251
00:16:44,282 --> 00:16:46,512
Spell "Boscodictiasaur."

252
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:52,119
I've never heard
of a "Boscodictiasaur."

253
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,622
Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.

254
00:16:57,461 --> 00:17:00,919
- Okay. B-O--
- No, it starts with a silent M.

255
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:03,328
Oh, come on!

256
00:17:09,674 --> 00:17:13,166
I can't believe Joey.
I hate being called a liar.

257
00:17:13,344 --> 00:17:14,777
But you are a liar.

258
00:17:16,113 --> 00:17:18,081
What did I just say?

259
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,747
- Are you still here?
- Yes.

260
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:25,719
And I'm not just hurt, I'm insulted.
When I tell somebody I did something--

261
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:29,724
Okay, hold on, let me just stop you
right there, okay? First, you lied. Right?

262
00:17:29,894 --> 00:17:32,454
Then you lied about lying, okay?

263
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,531
Then you lied about lying
about lying, okay?

264
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:41,104
So before you lie about lying
about lying about lying about lying....

265
00:17:43,107 --> 00:17:44,972
Stop lying.

266
00:17:45,142 --> 00:17:47,770
Why are you so sure
I didn't watch this tape?

267
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:50,038
You wanna know why?
You wanna know why?

268
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:52,481
Well, this is going well.

269
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:55,613
Here's how I know you didn't watch.

270
00:17:55,786 --> 00:18:00,655
If you had seen what was on this tape,
believe me, you'd have some comments.

271
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:03,623
All right, remember,
I got paid a lot of money for this...

272
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:05,989
...and it only aired in Japan.

273
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:08,592
<i>Ichiban.</i>

274
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:12,128
<i>Ichiban, lipstick for men.</i>

275
00:18:24,915 --> 00:18:27,907
<i>Ichiban, lipstick for men.</i>

276
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:34,090
And that's how I know
you didn't watch the tape.

277
00:18:37,128 --> 00:18:39,528
He really is a chameleon.

278
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,668
Well, Gladys, say hello
to your new home.

279
00:18:53,844 --> 00:18:56,506
- Oh, my.
- Wow.

280
00:18:56,681 --> 00:18:59,912
Oh, she is so nice and big.

281
00:19:01,786 --> 00:19:07,952
Oh, Monica, where are you going
to display Gladys, oh, so proudly?

282
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:13,225
- I haven't really settled on a spot yet.
- How about right above the TV?

283
00:19:13,431 --> 00:19:17,891
That way, it will be the first thing
that you see when you walk in the door.

284
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:22,563
Yeah, yeah, and you can get rid
of that French poster.

285
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,674
- I like that poster.
- Really?

286
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:27,303
It doesn't have anything
coming out of it.

287
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:30,813
Or maybe there's someplace
for her in your bedroom?

288
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:34,747
- There's nothing above your bed.
- Are you still here?

289
00:19:38,355 --> 00:19:41,586
Stupid Nobel Prize winner.

290
00:19:47,932 --> 00:19:49,763
Oh, hi. Hello.

291
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:54,371
Have you come to ask me some more
paleontology-related questions?

292
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:58,668
Your grandmother's nickname, perhaps?
Ann-Margret's pant size?

293
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:05,708
I've come here to apologize.
I think I may have let my feelings...

294
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:08,545
...for Charlie interfere
with the interview process.

295
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:10,812
No. Stop.

296
00:20:11,522 --> 00:20:14,457
Anyway, I decided
to offer you the grant.

297
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:20,655
- Really?
- There is just one small stipulation.

298
00:20:21,098 --> 00:20:24,966
- I have to break up with Charlie?
- Hey, you got one right.

299
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,904
- You're crazy.
- Crazy or romantic?

300
00:20:31,475 --> 00:20:32,737
Crazy.

301
00:20:35,246 --> 00:20:36,941
- Or?
- Get out!

302
00:20:43,888 --> 00:20:44,980
Oh, my God.

303
00:20:47,091 --> 00:20:51,460
- What?
- Joey, what is this thing doing here?

304
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:56,430
I got her from Monica. She sold it
to me for a very reasonable price.

305
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,229
- Joey, we're not keeping this.
- But it's an original Buffay.

306
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:06,137
All right, fine. You can keep it.

307
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,676
As long as you don't mind
that she's haunted.

308
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:10,370
Hey, what? What?

309
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:15,309
Well, legend has it, Joey, that she
comes alive when you're asleep.

310
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:20,613
She climbs out of the frame...

311
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:25,091
...and then drags her half-a-body
across the floor...

312
00:21:25,262 --> 00:21:27,093
...just looking for legs to steal.

313
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,897
And then with her one good hand...

314
00:21:31,068 --> 00:21:35,027
...she slowly reaches up...

315
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:37,436
...and turns your doorknob.

316
00:21:37,608 --> 00:21:41,408
Get that legless witch out of here!

317
00:21:46,851 --> 00:21:50,014
- Hey, I sold that to Joey.
- Yeah, well, I told him it's haunted.

318
00:21:50,187 --> 00:21:53,020
- Two can play at this game.
- Too late. You can't give it back.

319
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,385
- Oh, yes, I can.
- No, you can't, she's yours.

320
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,958
- She's yours.
- She's yours.

321
00:21:57,127 --> 00:21:59,527
- She's yours.
- Hey.

322
00:22:01,065 --> 00:22:02,589
- She's mine.
- She's mine.

323
00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:04,631
- She's mine.
- She's mine.

324
00:22:04,802 --> 00:22:08,033
You guys, you don't have
to fight over her anymore.

325
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:11,636
Whoever doesn't get Gladys,
gets Glynnis.

326
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,011
- I want Gladys.
- She's mine.

327
00:22:22,186 --> 00:22:24,177
- She's mine.
- She's mine.

328
00:22:31,962 --> 00:22:33,589
No, no. You don't get to do that.

329
00:22:33,764 --> 00:22:37,063
I know. Look, I'm sorry
I didn't give them your tape.

330
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:41,261
And I promise next time to submit you,
whether I think you're right or not.

331
00:22:41,438 --> 00:22:44,430
That's not the point, Chandler.
The point is that you lied.

332
00:22:44,608 --> 00:22:49,204
I know. You're right. What's it
gonna take for you to forgive me?

333
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,438
Oh, my God.

334
00:22:54,718 --> 00:22:56,777
Excellent.

335
00:22:57,721 --> 00:23:00,155
Now what do you say?

336
00:23:00,324 --> 00:23:02,519
Lying is wrong.

337
00:23:02,693 --> 00:23:05,184
And? And?

338
00:23:06,964 --> 00:23:09,728
I'm a pretty little girl.

339
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:12,835
I knew it.

340
00:23:20,477 --> 00:23:23,810
Your ex-boyfriend is insane.

341
00:23:24,515 --> 00:23:26,346
- He is a character.
- No, no, no.

342
00:23:26,517 --> 00:23:29,611
Charles Nelson Reilly is a character.

343
00:23:30,187 --> 00:23:32,655
- Who?
- Charles Nelson Reilly.

344
00:23:32,823 --> 00:23:35,951
<i>The Ghost and Mrs. Muir</i>?
<i>Match Game</i>?

345
00:23:37,594 --> 00:23:39,960
Were you never sick as a child?

346
00:23:40,731 --> 00:23:43,928
- Whatever. Did you get the grant?
- No. And you wanna know why?

347
00:23:44,101 --> 00:23:47,366
Because your ex-boyfriend
is still in love with you.

348
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:48,562
- What?
- Yeah.

349
00:23:48,739 --> 00:23:51,105
He refused me because
I wouldn't give you up.

350
00:23:51,275 --> 00:23:54,540
Benji isn't in love with me.
I mean, he broke up with me.

351
00:23:54,712 --> 00:23:59,046
- And besides, he's a very ethical man.
- Really?

352
00:23:59,783 --> 00:24:02,547
Is it ethical to ask someone
in a grant review:

353
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,585
"Who was the voice of Underdog?"

354
00:24:05,422 --> 00:24:06,980
I'm sure he was just joking.

355
00:24:07,157 --> 00:24:09,352
If you don't believe me,
let's go talk to him.

356
00:24:09,526 --> 00:24:12,586
I'm telling you, he didn't ask me
one paleontological question.

357
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:15,698
- Seriously?
- Oh, I'm sorry. No, he did ask me one:

358
00:24:15,866 --> 00:24:18,198
"How do you spell Boscodictiasaur?"

359
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:21,896
Well, if it's like the Lake Mbosco
in Congo, then M-B-O--

360
00:24:22,072 --> 00:24:23,232
Damn it.

361
00:24:26,877 --> 00:24:30,108
Dr. Geller. Charlie,
what are you doing here?

362
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,180
I want you to tell her everything.

363
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:36,012
About the deal you tried to make with me,
about the crazy questions you--

364
00:24:36,353 --> 00:24:41,484
Wally Cox. That's the voice of Underdog.

365
00:24:42,292 --> 00:24:44,385
Like I tried to tell you
in the interview...

366
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:48,497
...this grant is not based on your
knowledge of pretty useless trivia.

367
00:24:48,665 --> 00:24:53,625
No, don't do that. I want you to look
her in the eyes and tell her the truth.

368
00:24:54,872 --> 00:24:55,964
Benji?

369
00:24:57,174 --> 00:25:02,009
All right. It's true. I behaved horribly,
but it's only because I still love you.

370
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:05,114
And I would do anything
to have you back in my life.

371
00:25:05,282 --> 00:25:07,944
Too little, too late, Benji.

372
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:13,149
- I can't believe this.
- I never should've broken up with you.

373
00:25:13,323 --> 00:25:18,351
I think about you all the time.
Do you ever still think about me?

374
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:20,019
No.

375
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:23,230
- Yes.
- What?

376
00:25:24,034 --> 00:25:27,993
I don't know what to say, Benji.
This is all so...

377
00:25:28,172 --> 00:25:30,231
...romantic.

378
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:32,265
Or?

379
00:25:35,012 --> 00:25:37,207
I know I may be
way out of bounds here...

380
00:25:37,381 --> 00:25:40,839
...but is there any chance
you would take me back?

381
00:25:43,387 --> 00:25:45,514
Maybe.

382
00:25:45,689 --> 00:25:49,591
Sweetie, this conversation is starting
to make me a little uncomfortable.

383
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:55,027
Oh, God. I am so sorry, but--

384
00:25:55,199 --> 00:25:59,966
I mean, there's so much history
between us, you know?

385
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,638
I'm sorry too.

386
00:26:10,714 --> 00:26:14,411
- I love you.
- I love you too.

387
00:26:16,386 --> 00:26:19,446
Okay, that's it,
we are seeing other people.

388
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:40,198
Gladys?

389
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:51,017
For the third time this week.
Man, this does not get old.

390
00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:56,323
- You're mean!
- Oh, don't be such a baby. Please.
