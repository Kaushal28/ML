1
00:00:02,347 --> 00:00:04,838
Phoebe found out about this lady...

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,146
...who knew her parents,
and l don't know what happened.

3
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:11,013
l'm your mother.

4
00:00:11,757 --> 00:00:14,885
<i>Monica joked she</i>
<i>wouldn't date Chandler.</i>

5
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:17,994
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>happened there either.</i>

6
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:20,426
<i>Ross' new girlfriend shows up.</i>

7
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:24,568
<i>Rachel gets Bonnie to shave her head.</i>
<i>Then they kiss.</i>

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,933
<i>Now he has to choose</i>
<i>Rachel or the bald girl.</i>

9
00:00:28,273 --> 00:00:30,366
l don't know what
happened there either.

10
00:00:30,576 --> 00:00:33,044
Hold on.
Let me go get Chandler.

11
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:52,723
She's helping me.
My head's sunburned.

12
00:00:55,634 --> 00:00:58,933
-Thanks a million.
-You're welcome a million.

13
00:00:59,137 --> 00:01:01,105
Smell it.

14
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:05,734
Minty.

15
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,172
l'll be in our room.

16
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:24,789
Oh, my God!

17
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:26,487
l know.

18
00:01:30,268 --> 00:01:31,633
l got to go.

19
00:01:33,538 --> 00:01:36,166
l got to go break up with Bonnie.

20
00:01:36,775 --> 00:01:38,333
Here? Now?

21
00:01:38,577 --> 00:01:40,408
l can't stay here all night.

22
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:43,512
lf l go in there, she'll want to...

23
00:01:44,216 --> 00:01:45,205
...do stuff.

24
00:01:46,418 --> 00:01:49,114
Can't you say
you aren't in the mood?

25
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:50,777
No, she likes that.

26
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:54,487
Faking sleep doesn't work.

27
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,320
l've woken up many times with her--

28
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:03,167
-Why am l telling you?
-l don't know.

29
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:15,403
-Not every morning--
-Making it worse!

30
00:02:16,882 --> 00:02:18,782
The One with the Jellyfish

31
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:07,498
You probably want to know
how it happened.

32
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:10,200
l think l can figure it out.

33
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:14,269
l was born, and then
everyone lied their asses off.

34
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:17,474
No, it wasn't like that.

35
00:03:17,809 --> 00:03:21,301
Remember how l said
Lilly, Frank and l were close?

36
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:24,139
We were very close.

37
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,781
How close?

38
00:03:25,984 --> 00:03:29,579
The three of us were
kind of a couple.

39
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:33,857
l don't know how that would work.

40
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:35,151
l'm not asking!

41
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:39,053
Anyhow, somehow l got pregnant...

42
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:41,255
...and l was...

43
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:45,225
...scared.
l was stupid and selfish....

44
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:50,564
l was 1 8 years old.
Remember what it was like to be 1 8?

45
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:53,609
Mom killed herself
and my dad ran off.

46
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:57,781
l lived in a Gremlin with a guy
who talked to his hand.

47
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:04,455
l'm sorry. l thought l'd left you
with the best parents.

48
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:07,490
l didn't hear about them
till a few years ago.

49
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,920
By then, you were already grown-up.

50
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:14,691
You're here and l would
really like to get to know you.

51
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:16,766
Well, everybody does.

52
00:04:18,036 --> 00:04:20,061
l'm a really cool person.

53
00:04:20,372 --> 00:04:24,240
You had 29 years to find out,
but you didn't even try.

54
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:28,638
You walked out on me,
and l'll do the same.

55
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:32,139
l don't ever want to see you again.

56
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:38,055
Where's my purse?

57
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,949
Shoot! We're out of soda.

58
00:04:42,227 --> 00:04:44,559
-l'll get you some.
-Really?

59
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:47,129
No, because l'm not your boyfriend.

60
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:51,067
Hey, Pheebs, how'd it go?

61
00:04:53,605 --> 00:04:57,041
My mom's friend, Phoebe,
is actually my birth mom.

62
00:05:00,445 --> 00:05:02,777
l found a dried-up seahorse.

63
00:05:03,782 --> 00:05:05,215
What do you mean?

64
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:08,386
My new mom,
who's a big fat abandoner.

65
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:13,357
Don't you want to stay here
and talk about it?

66
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:17,090
l need to be alone.

67
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:29,163
Man. Hey...

68
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:32,640
...what if you found out that
your mom wasn't really your mom...

69
00:05:32,777 --> 00:05:36,474
...and your new mom turned
out to be really hot?

70
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:39,516
Oh, man, huh?

71
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:43,382
But, it's your mom.

72
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:47,048
No, l'm talking about your mom.

73
00:05:55,934 --> 00:05:56,958
lt's over.

74
00:05:58,536 --> 00:06:00,197
Was it awful?

75
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:01,862
lt was long.

76
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:04,734
l didn't realize how late it was...

77
00:06:04,943 --> 00:06:07,969
...till l saw the five o'clock shadow
on her head.

78
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:17,446
She didn't want to stay.
l called a cab. She just left.

79
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,121
l wrote you a letter.

80
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,230
Oh, thank you!

81
00:06:30,335 --> 00:06:32,132
l like mail.

82
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:40,538
lt's just some things l've been
thinking about. About us.

83
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:44,215
Before we even think about us
getting back together...

84
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:47,509
...l need to know
how you feel about this stuff.

85
00:06:57,996 --> 00:07:00,123
lt's 5:30 in the morning.

86
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:06,459
So l'd better get
cracking on this baby.

87
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:11,571
l'll be waiting for you.
Come up when you're done.

88
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:14,645
l'll be up...

89
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,947
...in 1 8 pages.

90
00:07:19,117 --> 00:07:20,414
Front and back.

91
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:24,118
Very exciting!

92
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:52,616
What happened to you?
Why didn't you come up?

93
00:07:53,318 --> 00:07:54,444
Done.

94
00:07:56,254 --> 00:07:59,485
-You just finished?
-l wanted to be thorough.

95
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:05,356
This is clearly
very important to you. To us.

96
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,296
l wanted to read
every word carefully.

97
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:11,765
Twice.

98
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:17,040
Does it?

99
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,414
l'm sorry?

100
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,242
Does it?

101
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:32,447
Does it? Does it?

102
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,924
l wanted to give that whole
''Does it?'' part another glance.

103
00:08:40,098 --> 00:08:43,192
What do you mean?
You said you read it twice.

104
00:08:43,468 --> 00:08:47,063
lt either does or doesn't.
lf you have to think--

105
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:50,570
No, l don't have to think about it.

106
00:08:50,775 --> 00:08:52,037
ln fact...

107
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:55,541
...l've decided.
l have decided...

108
00:08:56,047 --> 00:08:57,708
...that it...

109
00:09:03,221 --> 00:09:04,586
...does.

110
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:24,307
-Are you sure?
-Sure, l'm sure!

111
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:35,747
There's a nuclear holocaust.
l'm the last man on earth.

112
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:38,316
Would you go out with me?

113
00:09:43,628 --> 00:09:46,062
l've got canned goods.

114
00:09:47,098 --> 00:09:49,191
Take a look at this!

115
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:52,562
Check this baby out!
Dug me a hole.

116
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,698
Excellent hole, Joe.

117
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:00,707
Oh, no! My hole!

118
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,369
My foot!

119
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:04,540
What is it?

120
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:08,044
Jellyfish sting!
lt hurts!

121
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:10,310
Can we help you to the house?

122
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:11,853
lt's two miles.

123
00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:14,320
And l'm tired from digging.

124
00:10:15,894 --> 00:10:17,657
Damn the jellyfish!

125
00:10:17,896 --> 00:10:20,364
Damn all the jellyfish!

126
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:21,862
Do something.

127
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,567
There's only one thing.

128
00:10:23,768 --> 00:10:24,860
What is it?

129
00:10:25,103 --> 00:10:26,365
Pee on it.

130
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:30,196
Gross!

131
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:32,602
l saw it on Discovery Channel.

132
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:36,244
He's right.
There's ammonia in that...

133
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:38,280
...that kills the pain.

134
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,418
Forget it.
lt doesn't hurt that bad!

135
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:45,521
You can use my hole for privacy.

136
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:52,256
l'm ready to get
the hell out of here.

137
00:10:54,732 --> 00:10:55,892
Are you--?

138
00:10:57,635 --> 00:10:59,535
That's so great!

139
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:01,031
Not for Bonnie.

140
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:04,565
But for you, yea!

141
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:09,944
-How was the beach?
-Nothing. l don't know.

142
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,618
-What happened?
-Nothing.

143
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:17,287
-l'm going to shower.
-Me too.

144
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:18,749
Me too.

145
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:21,719
l'll put this in the car.

146
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,121
l have to go pack!

147
00:11:25,496 --> 00:11:28,124
-And it really does?
-lt does.

148
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,426
lt really and truly does.

149
00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:55,922
lt so does not!

150
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:06,561
She wants me to take responsibility
for everything that went wrong.

151
00:12:07,205 --> 00:12:12,040
She goes on for five pages
about how l was unfaithful to her.

152
00:12:12,744 --> 00:12:15,338
We were on a break!

153
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:19,777
lf you say that one more time,
l'll break up with you.

154
00:12:21,185 --> 00:12:24,848
This breakup was not all my fault.
She says here...

155
00:12:25,156 --> 00:12:27,954
... ''lf you accept full responsibility...

156
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,684
...l can begin to trust you again.

157
00:12:30,895 --> 00:12:34,558
Does that seem like
something you can do? Does it?''

158
00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:43,169
You have what you want.
You're back with her.

159
00:12:43,408 --> 00:12:46,343
lf you bring this up now,
you'll wreck it.

160
00:12:46,644 --> 00:12:48,976
Yeah, l know.
You're right.

161
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:52,443
l'll let it go.

162
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,913
But you know how hard it is
to forget this?

163
00:12:56,187 --> 00:12:57,745
Sure, it's hard...

164
00:12:58,022 --> 00:13:00,752
...but you don't have to talk about it.

165
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:04,059
A lot happened on that trip...

166
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:07,425
...that we should
never, ever talk about.

167
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:12,229
What happened on that beach?

168
00:13:13,938 --> 00:13:16,930
lt's between us and the sea, Ross.

169
00:13:26,517 --> 00:13:27,916
Hi, Ursula.

170
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:32,949
l know that we haven't talked
in a long time.

171
00:13:33,257 --> 00:13:37,990
Our mom is not our birth mom.
This other lady is our birth mom.

172
00:13:38,229 --> 00:13:41,357
Right, the one that lives in Montauk.

173
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:42,822
You know her?

174
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:46,832
No. l read about her
in Mom's suicide note.

175
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:51,337
There was a suicide note?
Do you still have it?

176
00:13:52,276 --> 00:13:53,868
Hang on.

177
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:59,149
l can't believe you didn't tell me
there was a suicide note.

178
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:01,612
Yeah, so how have you been doing?

179
00:14:02,954 --> 00:14:04,251
Shut up!

180
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,456
''Goodbye, Phoebe and Ursula.
l'll miss you.

181
00:14:11,662 --> 00:14:14,153
P.S. Your mom lives in Montauk.''

182
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:16,899
You just wrote this!

183
00:14:18,403 --> 00:14:20,997
lt's pretty much the gist.

184
00:14:22,273 --> 00:14:25,401
Except for the poem.
You read the poem, right?

185
00:14:27,712 --> 00:14:29,703
All right. Hang on.

186
00:14:34,652 --> 00:14:36,677
Pass the cheese, please.

187
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:44,928
You can't even look at me, can you?

188
00:14:47,865 --> 00:14:50,231
lt's Phoebe!
We can talk to Phoebe!

189
00:14:52,537 --> 00:14:54,300
l'm too depressed to talk.

190
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:56,733
l'll give you $ 1 000 to talk to us.

191
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:02,073
What about making that
beach trip an annual thing?

192
00:15:04,382 --> 00:15:06,316
What happened out there?

193
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:10,082
What? We took a walk.
Nothing happened.

194
00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:13,221
l came back with nothing all over me.

195
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:15,522
What happened?
Joey?

196
00:15:17,161 --> 00:15:18,321
All right.

197
00:15:18,596 --> 00:15:20,496
We swore we'd never tell.

198
00:15:20,731 --> 00:15:22,756
They'll never understand.

199
00:15:26,003 --> 00:15:29,769
We have to get it out.
lt's eating me alive!

200
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:36,042
-Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
-All right!

201
00:15:43,988 --> 00:15:45,649
l got stung.

202
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:48,621
Stung bad.

203
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:52,356
l couldn't stand.

204
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,559
l couldn't walk.

205
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:57,359
We were two miles from the house.

206
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:00,728
We were scared and alone.

207
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:03,930
We didn't think we could make it.

208
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:09,936
l was in too much pain.

209
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:12,274
And l was tired from digging.

210
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:17,447
Then Joey remembered something.

211
00:16:18,556 --> 00:16:20,888
l'd seen it on Discovery Channel.

212
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,752
Wait, l saw that.

213
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,420
On the Discovery Channel.
About jellyfish and how if you--

214
00:16:32,003 --> 00:16:33,561
You peed on yourself?

215
00:16:35,773 --> 00:16:38,867
You can't say that!
You don't know!

216
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:41,675
l thought l would pass out.

217
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:45,541
l tried, but l couldn't...

218
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,212
...bend that way.

219
00:16:57,128 --> 00:16:59,926
That's right.
l stepped up.

220
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:05,163
She's my friend and she needed help.

221
00:17:05,703 --> 00:17:08,103
lf l had to,
l'd pee on any of you.

222
00:17:13,811 --> 00:17:14,835
Only...

223
00:17:15,046 --> 00:17:16,206
...l couldn't.

224
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:21,843
l got the stage fright.

225
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:27,223
l wanted to help,
but there was too much pressure.

226
00:17:27,491 --> 00:17:29,550
So l turned to Chandler.

227
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,233
Joey kept screaming at me,
''Do it now. Do it. Do it now!''

228
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:42,400
Sometimes, late at night,
l can still hear the screaming.

229
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:48,775
Because l do it through my wall
to freak you out.

230
00:17:49,347 --> 00:17:51,440
Maybe there's somebody
you guys could talk to.

231
00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:53,209
Oh, who?

232
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:56,479
lt's not like they have a group
for people like us.

233
00:17:57,321 --> 00:18:00,916
Yeah, no, there's this
guy Owen, he's the best.

234
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:03,458
Might have his card.

235
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:08,625
<i>And fuchsia and mauve</i>

236
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,669
<i>Those are the 66 colors of my bedroom</i>

237
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,802
l invite all of you to count
the colors in your bedroom.

238
00:18:21,746 --> 00:18:24,112
Except for you.
You go away.

239
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:30,143
l'll go in a second.

240
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:32,321
l just want to tell you...

241
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,424
...there wasn't a day
l didn't regret giving you up.

242
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:38,352
Okay, bye.

243
00:18:40,131 --> 00:18:41,325
l'm not done.

244
00:18:41,532 --> 00:18:44,990
The reason l never
looked you up was because...

245
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:47,303
...l was afraid you'd react...

246
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:50,871
...just like the way
you're reacting now.

247
00:18:51,142 --> 00:18:54,578
Can't we just start from here?
Please?

248
00:18:56,213 --> 00:18:58,078
No.

249
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:04,952
Sorry.

250
00:19:06,824 --> 00:19:08,291
One last thing.

251
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:11,927
You came looking for family.

252
00:19:13,431 --> 00:19:15,092
l'm family.

253
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:18,330
l'm it.

254
00:19:21,105 --> 00:19:22,800
Now l'm done.

255
00:19:25,943 --> 00:19:29,140
lt's not like we're losing anything.

256
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:32,012
l guess you're right.

257
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:36,919
lt's not like we know each other
or have anything in common.

258
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:39,219
l don't know.
lt's not like...

259
00:19:39,423 --> 00:19:42,085
...we don't have anything in common.

260
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:46,193
l mean, l like pizza.

261
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:48,625
l like pizza!

262
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:53,069
Wait, l like the Beatles.

263
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:54,804
Oh, my God!
So do l.

264
00:19:57,074 --> 00:19:59,167
Puppies.
Cute or ugly?

265
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:01,334
So cute!

266
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,247
You see?

267
00:20:04,949 --> 00:20:06,917
But l'm still mad at you.

268
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:08,642
l know.

269
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:11,587
l'm mad at me too.

270
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:17,626
Do you want to get something to eat?
l'm kind of hungry.

271
00:20:17,962 --> 00:20:19,793
Hey! Me too!

272
00:20:19,964 --> 00:20:21,989
Uncanny.

273
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:26,236
lt looks like rain
and l don't have my umbrella.

274
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:27,893
Me neither. l really hate that.

275
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:31,769
Stop it. Now you're just
doing it to freak me out.

276
00:20:37,782 --> 00:20:39,443
l missed you.

277
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:41,548
l missed you too.

278
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:47,380
l was so nervous about that letter.

279
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:53,628
But the way you
owned up to everything...

280
00:20:53,898 --> 00:20:57,356
...it just showed me
how much you've grown.

281
00:20:59,737 --> 00:21:01,568
l suppose.

282
00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:06,299
You have, Ross.
You should give yourself credit.

283
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,137
My mom never thought
this would work out.

284
00:21:11,148 --> 00:21:14,914
She said, ''Once a cheater,
always a cheater.''

285
00:21:18,923 --> 00:21:21,949
l just wish we hadn't
lost those four months.

286
00:21:22,593 --> 00:21:27,394
But if time was what you needed
to gain a little perspective....

287
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:31,829
We were on a break!

288
00:21:33,037 --> 00:21:35,028
-Coffeehouse?
-You bet.

289
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:39,600
lt took two people
to break up this relationship.

290
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:44,907
You and that girl, which yesterday
you took full responsibility for.

291
00:21:45,182 --> 00:21:47,912
l didn't know what
l took responsibility for.

292
00:21:48,118 --> 00:21:49,949
l didn't finish the letter.

293
00:21:50,754 --> 00:21:52,016
l fell asleep.

294
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:54,280
You fell asleep?

295
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:58,092
lt was 5:30 in the morning.

296
00:21:58,329 --> 00:22:03,198
And you had rambled on for 1 8 pages.

297
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:06,763
Front and back!

298
00:22:08,572 --> 00:22:13,441
By the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E
means ''you are.''

299
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:15,338
Y-O-U-R means ''your.''

300
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,349
l can't believe l thought of getting
back with you! We are so over.

301
00:22:23,153 --> 00:22:24,518
Fine by me!

302
00:22:25,823 --> 00:22:29,953
Those spelling tips will be handy
Saturday nights at home...

303
00:22:30,194 --> 00:22:32,059
...playing Scrabble with Monica.

304
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:33,958
Sorry!

305
00:22:35,132 --> 00:22:38,659
All that sleep you'll miss
wishing you were with me!

306
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:41,303
Don't worry about me falling asleep.

307
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:43,834
l still have your letter!

308
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:48,542
Just so you know,
it's not that common.

309
00:22:48,746 --> 00:22:51,010
lt doesn't happen to every guy.

310
00:22:51,215 --> 00:22:53,149
And it is a big deal!

311
00:22:54,018 --> 00:22:55,815
l knew it!

312
00:23:00,457 --> 00:23:01,617
Gin.

313
00:23:03,093 --> 00:23:05,084
We were playing gin?

314
00:23:07,164 --> 00:23:10,327
lf we were a couple,
we could play naked.

315
00:23:11,235 --> 00:23:14,830
-Would you stop?
-Okay. All right.

316
00:23:15,105 --> 00:23:15,935
All right.

317
00:23:16,173 --> 00:23:17,834
l think you're great.

318
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,938
l think you're sweet and smart...

319
00:23:21,512 --> 00:23:23,537
...and l love you.

320
00:23:24,548 --> 00:23:27,881
But you'll always be the guy
who peed on me.

321
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:30,676
