1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,256
You have got to try this cheesecake.

2
00:00:07,492 --> 00:00:10,222
You know, I'm not that much
of a sweet tooth--

3
00:00:11,563 --> 00:00:13,758
Oh, my God, it's so creamy!

4
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:17,132
That's the best
cheesecake I've ever had!

5
00:00:17,402 --> 00:00:19,063
Where did you get this?

6
00:00:19,738 --> 00:00:23,572
It was at the front door when I got
home. Somebody sent it to us.

7
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:26,304
This isn't addressed to you.

8
00:00:26,578 --> 00:00:29,809
This is addressed
to Mrs. Braverman downstairs!

9
00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:31,572
Thief!

10
00:00:32,517 --> 00:00:34,883
I didn't read the bo<i>x</i>
before I opened it...

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,748
...and you can't return a bo<i>x</i>
after you opened it!

12
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:41,084
-Why not?
-Because it's too deIicious!

13
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:45,319
You stoIe this cheesecake.
That's wrong.

14
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:50,159
No, it'II be okay because Mrs. Braverman
wiII send for a free one.

15
00:00:50,402 --> 00:00:52,131
That way, we aII win.

16
00:00:52,337 --> 00:00:56,296
The onIy Iosers are the
big cheesecake congIomerate...

17
00:00:56,608 --> 00:00:59,042
...''Mama's LittIe Bakery.''

18
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:01,637
I feeI terribIe.

19
00:01:01,913 --> 00:01:04,347
I'm a horribIe, horribIe person.

20
00:01:05,684 --> 00:01:07,345
I'm sorry, what?

21
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:11,284
The One With AII The Cheesecakes

22
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:49,549
I shouId get going. Big day at work.

23
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:51,853
You know how I'm in a coma?

24
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,127
Today they do a test on me and it
turns out I'm not brain-dead.

25
00:01:57,002 --> 00:01:58,128
So--

26
00:01:58,336 --> 00:01:59,928
Mr. Smarty Pants.

27
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:02,538
It's just my character
that's not brain-dead.

28
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:05,439
Pheebs, stiII on for tonight?

29
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:07,941
-AbsoIuteIy.
-I'II see you at 8.

30
00:02:08,146 --> 00:02:09,738
What's at 8?

31
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:14,850
Dinner. We get together about once
a month to discuss the rest of you.

32
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:18,285
Wow! Did not know that.

33
00:02:18,523 --> 00:02:21,048
May I say how IoveIy you Iook today?

34
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:22,317
DuIy noted.

35
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:27,894
So for tomorrow, do you want to
rent a car and drive down together?

36
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,692
-What are you taIking about?
-Cousin Frannie's wedding.

37
00:02:32,504 --> 00:02:35,132
You were invited?

38
00:02:36,274 --> 00:02:37,832
No.

39
00:02:38,043 --> 00:02:40,341
Oh, my God, I can't beIieve this.

40
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,979
I thought onIy Mom and Dad
were invited.

41
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:47,345
From the ages of 7 to 9,
Frannie and I were inseparabIe.

42
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:51,386
Maybe since the age of 9,
Frannie's made some new friends.

43
00:02:53,692 --> 00:02:55,626
Do you wanna make some new friends?

44
00:02:57,662 --> 00:03:00,825
It's probabIy just a mistake.
Let me caII Aunt CheryI.

45
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:04,366
Maybe you are invited and the
invitation got Iost in the maiI.

46
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:07,629
You caII her and teII her
that when we were kids...

47
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:11,138
...her precious Frannie
tried to undress me severaI times.

48
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:14,971
If I hadn't stopped her, there
wouIdn't be a wedding to go to.

49
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:17,943
She tried to undress me too.

50
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,245
I used to undress my cousin GIenn.

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,519
Joseph Francis Tribbiani,
are you home yet?

52
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:34,855
I think he's stiII out.
What's wrong?

53
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,466
I'II teII you, RacheI Karen Greene.

54
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:40,694
I had pIans with Joey,
and he Ieft me this note.

55
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:44,407
''Pheebs, can't make it.
Got a date. TaIk to you Iater.

56
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:46,270
Big Daddy.''

57
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:50,271
-''Big Daddy''?
-That's a nickname we were trying.

58
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:53,315
Why didn't you guys try ''Francis''?

59
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:57,320
Francis is a cooIer name than ChandIer,
isn't it?

60
00:03:58,123 --> 00:04:02,423
You know what nickname
never caught on? ''The Ross-a-tron.''

61
00:04:07,065 --> 00:04:09,090
Here's Joseph Francis!

62
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:12,565
Wait, what are you
middIe-naming me for?

63
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:14,238
I Ieft you a note.

64
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:16,771
That doesn't give you the
right to ditch me!

65
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:20,944
You can canceI pIans with friends
if there's a possibiIity for se<i>x</i>.

66
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:23,340
He's right. That is the ruIe.

67
00:04:23,515 --> 00:04:25,278
-ReaIIy?
-WeII, that's what I hear.

68
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,248
I've never gotten a chance
to actuaIIy empIoy the ruIe.

69
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:33,948
I don't accept it. When we make
pIans, I e<i>x</i>pect you to show up.

70
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,356
I'm not a way to kiII time
tiII you meet someone better.

71
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:42,225
Boyfriends and girIfriends wiII
come and go, but this is for Iife.

72
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:46,527
I'm so sorry. I had no idea
it wouId bother you this much.

73
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:48,102
WeII, it does.

74
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,467
WeII, can I make it up to you?

75
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:51,970
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:56,145
How about dinner tomorrow night?
I'II pay for myseIf.

77
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,414
Okay, you wore me down.

78
00:05:02,287 --> 00:05:06,451
WhiIe you're over there, how
about a beer for ''The Ross-a-tron''?

79
00:05:07,726 --> 00:05:09,660
''Ross--'' Is that back?

80
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:22,002
The other cheesecake came.

81
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,640
They deIivered it here again.

82
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:28,341
Just bring it downstairs.
What's the probIem?

83
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:30,537
I can't seem to say goodbye.

84
00:05:30,782 --> 00:05:32,079
Are you serious?

85
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:35,548
We ate an entire cake
two days ago and you want more?

86
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:38,415
WeII, I've forgotten
what it tastes Iike.

87
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,557
It was cheesecake. It was fine.

88
00:05:41,793 --> 00:05:45,661
It had a buttery, crumbIy,
graham cracker crust...

89
00:05:45,864 --> 00:05:48,697
...with a very rich...

90
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:52,869
...yet Iight cream cheese fiIIing.

91
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:57,540
Wow, my whoIe mouth
just fiIIed with saIiva.

92
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:01,172
Know what? Forget it.
We're just hungry.

93
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:03,870
We haven't had Iunch.
We're just Iightheaded.

94
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:07,607
So Iet's go have Iunch
and forget about the cheesecake.

95
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:10,252
We'II drop it off
so we're not tempted.

96
00:06:10,455 --> 00:06:13,720
-Where do you want to eat?
-Mama's LittIe Bakery, Chicago.

97
00:06:18,897 --> 00:06:21,422
MeI Tormé died.

98
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:24,259
Joey, that paper's Iike a year oId.

99
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:27,961
Does that mean the Sam Goody's saIe
is over?

100
00:06:31,276 --> 00:06:34,074
So I finaIIy heard back
from Aunt CheryI...

101
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:36,837
...and apparentIy it wasn't a mistake.

102
00:06:37,115 --> 00:06:38,844
There's Iimited seating--

103
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:43,816
Limited seating? I am just
one tiny person!

104
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:46,647
Yeah, but she doesn't know that.

105
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:49,450
I mean, the Iast time she saw you...

106
00:06:49,727 --> 00:06:53,754
...you'd have turned one of those
IittIe wedding chairs into kindIing.

107
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,262
''Limited seating.''
That's such a Iame e<i>x</i>cuse.

108
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,030
That's not the reason
she's not inviting me.

109
00:07:01,306 --> 00:07:05,106
What's the big deaI? I wasn't invited
to the ceremony, just the reception.

110
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:09,746
If it makes you feeI any better, Joan
and I wiII just make an appearance...

111
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:13,280
...and then we'II Ieave earIy
as a sign of protest.

112
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:15,851
-Joan?
-Yeah, my date.

113
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:20,115
Assistant professor in Iinguistics.
TaII, very beautifuI.

114
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:24,692
And despite what some peopIe say,
not broad-backed.

115
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:28,894
Wait a minute.
You got ''Ross GeIIer and Guest''?

116
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:31,362
I wasn't invited,
and you got ''and Guest''?

117
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:34,697
E<i>x</i>cuse me, I do have to interrupt
on Ross' behaIf.

118
00:07:34,973 --> 00:07:36,873
I think the ruIe appIies here.

119
00:07:37,075 --> 00:07:39,305
Since he has a chance
to get on broad-back--

120
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:40,841
Not broad-back!

121
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:45,607
Dude, I've seen her. She's Iike a biIIboard.

122
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:49,686
Wait a minute. You're bringing me.

123
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:51,479
I can't canceI on Joan.

124
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:53,714
-Why not?
-Did you not hear me?

125
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:57,759
She's an assistant professor
in the Iinguistics department.

126
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:59,997
They're wiId.

127
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:03,930
-Why do you want to come anyway?
-Because...

128
00:08:04,102 --> 00:08:05,626
...she's my cousin.

129
00:08:05,904 --> 00:08:08,668
I mean, we grew up together.

130
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,740
FamiIy, you know?
And aII that's important to me.

131
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:15,936
Okay, aII right. I'II take you.

132
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,909
I'II go caII Joan.

133
00:08:19,117 --> 00:08:20,744
Oh, that's nice.

134
00:08:20,952 --> 00:08:22,749
FamiIy shouId be there.

135
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:25,148
It's her wedding.
Happiest day of her Iife.

136
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,084
We'II see.

137
00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:33,963
WeII, thank you for Iunch.

138
00:08:34,198 --> 00:08:36,166
Wait, I thought you paid.

139
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:39,097
ApparentIy, we don't pay
for food anymore.

140
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:44,701
-Do you see what I see?
-It's stiII there.

141
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:48,075
Mrs. Braverman must be out.

142
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:54,852
She couId be out of town.
Maybe gone for months.

143
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:58,680
By then, it may spoiI.
She can't come back to bad cheesecake.

144
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,824
-It couId kiII her.
-Don't want that.

145
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:02,218
We're protecting her.

146
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,688
-We'II take it.
-But <i>q</i>uick.

147
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:05,827
-Why?
-I hear her in there.

148
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:08,463
Go! Go! Go!

149
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:15,337
Do you think it's inappropriate to wear
a white, Iacy dress to a wedding?

150
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:17,974
-Yes.
-E<i>x</i>ceIIent.

151
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:23,477
Oh, my God, that's David.

152
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:25,648
-Who?
-David, the scientist guy.

153
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:27,851
David that I was in Iove with.

154
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:30,612
Who went to Russia
and broke my heart, David.

155
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:31,880
Oh, my God!

156
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:34,454
Say their name enough,
they turn around.

157
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:37,856
Phoebe.

158
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:40,063
David.

159
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:45,694
What are you doing?
Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?

160
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,700
I'm just in town for a conference.

161
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:51,500
God, you Iook phenomenaI.

162
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:53,175
WeII....

163
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:54,640
Yeah.

164
00:09:55,313 --> 00:09:58,214
You Iook great too.
Did you get a haircut?

165
00:09:58,483 --> 00:10:01,008
Yeah. WeII, I got Iike 30 of them.

166
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:04,982
Look, I got a confession to make.

167
00:10:05,223 --> 00:10:07,487
I was hoping to run into you here.

168
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:11,492
I didn't know if I shouId caII.
I was onIy in town a few days...

169
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:14,164
...and I didn't want to intrude
on your Iife.

170
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:16,230
I reaIIy wanted to see you...

171
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:19,402
...but I didn't know
if you wanted to see me.

172
00:10:20,238 --> 00:10:24,732
Of course I wouId want to see you.
I think about you aII the time.

173
00:10:24,942 --> 00:10:27,911
ReaIIy? Because I think about you
aII the time.

174
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:32,206
There's a statue in Minsk
that reminds me of you so much.

175
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,680
It's actuaIIy of Lenin...

176
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:38,117
...but, you know, at certain angIes....

177
00:10:38,923 --> 00:10:41,551
Anyway, do you want
to have dinner tonight?

178
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:43,123
Yes.

179
00:10:43,428 --> 00:10:45,055
Oh, no!

180
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,554
-What?
-I can't.

181
00:10:47,832 --> 00:10:51,063
I can't beIieve I have pIans.
Can you do it tomorrow?

182
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:55,865
No, I have to go in a few hours.
I have to be on the redeye.

183
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,768
Listen, ne<i>x</i>t time you're in Minsk....

184
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,341
Phoebe? Can I taIk to you
for a second?

185
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,047
What are you doing?

186
00:11:04,282 --> 00:11:05,749
I have pIans with Joey.

187
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:07,541
So? He'II understand.

188
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:10,448
No, he won't.
And that's not even the point.

189
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:15,786
I made a whoIe speech about how
you do not canceI pIans with friends.

190
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:19,758
And now just because, potentiaIIy,
the Iove of my Iife...

191
00:11:19,997 --> 00:11:22,261
...returns from Russia
for one night...

192
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,298
...I shouId change my beIiefs?

193
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,595
I shouId change my beIiefs!

194
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:32,768
No. If I don't have my principIes,
I don't have anything.

195
00:11:32,977 --> 00:11:34,137
You're so strong.

196
00:11:34,412 --> 00:11:38,405
Or I shouId rush through dinner
with Joey and meet David at 9.

197
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:44,783
Oh, my God, that is so good!

198
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:48,492
I'm fuII. And yet I know
if I stop eating this...

199
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,352
...I'II regret it.

200
00:11:52,163 --> 00:11:54,131
Hey, what have you got there?

201
00:11:54,398 --> 00:11:55,763
Oh, it's....

202
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,264
It's tofu cake. Want some?

203
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:04,304
What are you doing tonight?

204
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:06,802
Dude. Dude.

205
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:09,445
Sorry.

206
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,409
I got pIans with Phoebe.

207
00:12:11,616 --> 00:12:14,449
ReaIIy? Monica said
she had a date at 9.

208
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:17,381
-What? Tonight?
-That's what Monica said.

209
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:22,252
After that speech, she makes a date on
the same night she has pIans with me?

210
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,258
She's trying to puII a fast one
on Big Daddy.

211
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:29,794
-Now, if you'II e<i>x</i>cuse me....
-Dude, dude!

212
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:33,459
If I took off my pants right now,
how wouId you feeI?

213
00:12:33,638 --> 00:12:35,799
Like your cousin GIenn.

214
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,837
Here, I think this is us.

215
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:48,611
Limited seating, my ass.

216
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,913
Let's see who made the cut.

217
00:12:51,122 --> 00:12:53,090
Hi. I'm Monica GeIIer.

218
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,749
-How do you know the bride and groom?
-I worked with Frannie.

219
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:59,292
Used to work with her. Used to.

220
00:12:59,564 --> 00:13:01,828
I'm a reIative
and I didn't get invited.

221
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:04,567
A bIood reIative. BIood.

222
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:08,970
Stop saying ''bIood'' to strangers.

223
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,770
From the ages of 7 to 9, we were
inseparabIe, and I didn't even get invited!

224
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:16,038
Then why are you here?

225
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:19,183
-I'm my brother's date.
-Hey, I had a date, okay?

226
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,808
Joan Tedeschi, the Iinguist.

227
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:26,713
So how about you?
How do you know the happy coupIe?

228
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:29,121
We went to coIIege with both of them.

229
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:31,420
Now we Iive ne<i>x</i>t door.

230
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:33,119
Okay, you're fine.

231
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:38,328
You know, you wouId've Iiked Joan,
she's very pIeasant.

232
00:13:39,437 --> 00:13:44,204
There! There! Her back Iooks Iike that.
That's not broad, is it?

233
00:13:49,146 --> 00:13:51,842
Come on, Joey, you've got to be ready
to order by now.

234
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:55,315
You know, I don't I Iike this tabIe
either. Maybe we shouId move again.

235
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:58,717
No, we're staying right here.
E<i>x</i>cuse me, we're ready to order.

236
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,414
I don't work here.

237
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:03,723
WeII, then you shouIdn't be
waIking around.

238
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,892
-Are you guys ready?
-Yes.

239
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:14,400
I'II have a green saIad,
house dressing and water's fine.

240
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:16,172
And for you, sir?

241
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,068
Yeah. This sIow-roasted saImon...

242
00:14:19,277 --> 00:14:20,801
...how sIow are we taIking?

243
00:14:21,812 --> 00:14:23,973
It's aIready been roasted.

244
00:14:24,248 --> 00:14:28,014
Oh, then no. Maybe I shouId hear
the speciaIs again.

245
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:30,880
We've heard the speciaIs three times.

246
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:35,115
There's prime rib, mahi-mahi
and a very speciaI Iobster ravioIi.

247
00:14:35,393 --> 00:14:40,023
-ActuaIIy, we're out of the ravioIi.
-WeII, that changes everything!

248
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,464
You know what, Pheebs?
You were right before.

249
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:46,693
Friends are so important.

250
00:14:46,938 --> 00:14:49,202
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.

251
00:14:49,507 --> 00:14:50,997
Know what I reaIIy want?

252
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:54,438
-What?
-Is to have a Iong, Iong taIk.

253
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:58,615
You know? Get Joey out on the
open road and reaIIy open him up.

254
00:14:59,717 --> 00:15:01,480
-Any progress?
-Yes.

255
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:04,484
I wiII have the Iobster ravioIi.

256
00:15:05,323 --> 00:15:07,655
God, Joey, this is taking forever.

257
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:09,483
-What's the rush?
-WeII...

258
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:12,355
...I have an appointment.

259
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:14,463
And it's very important.

260
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:15,927
What is it?

261
00:15:16,801 --> 00:15:18,063
WeII...

262
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:19,701
...it's a date.

263
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:24,499
A date? No, you must be mistaken,
because you wouIdn't have a date...

264
00:15:24,742 --> 00:15:27,370
...on the same night
you have pIans with a friend.

265
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:29,476
Don't make me feeI badIy.

266
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,147
No, I'm gonna!

267
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:36,380
You made me feeI reaIIy guiIty
about going out with that girI.

268
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:40,523
Like I did something terribIe.
Now you're doing the same thing.

269
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:43,023
It's not! It's totaIIy different!

270
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:46,458
This is with David.
Remember David, the scientist guy?

271
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,255
He's very speciaI to me.

272
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:52,024
My girI the other night was speciaI.
She was a scientist too.

273
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:55,204
-She was?
-WeII, she graduated high schooI.

274
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:57,734
Whatever. Know what?

275
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:01,570
He's onIy here for four
hours and I'm gonna go see him.

276
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:03,508
-Fine!
-Yeah.

277
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:09,709
What are you stiII doing here?
I toId you, Iobster ravioIi!

278
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:16,392
I was about to Ieave.
I didn't think you were coming.

279
00:16:16,594 --> 00:16:18,892
I wouIdn't have missed this.

280
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,221
WeII, I'm very gIad you're here.

281
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,893
Oh, you're such a gentIeman.

282
00:16:24,135 --> 00:16:26,194
Come on, we're going to my pIace.

283
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,501
Are you eating the cheesecake
without me?

284
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:41,780
I wiII give you $ 1 00
to whistIe right now.

285
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:49,151
-How can you eat it without me?
-What'II you do?

286
00:16:49,427 --> 00:16:53,386
TeII Monica or Joey?
No, you'd have to teII them everything.

287
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:57,465
We're dessert steaIers.
We're Iiving outside the Iaw.

288
00:16:57,668 --> 00:16:59,966
I don't trust you with this cake.

289
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:02,605
I got it first,
and I'm taking it back!

290
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,673
-What? Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

291
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:08,543
You think I trust you with it?

292
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,303
No, we'II spIit it.

293
00:17:10,548 --> 00:17:12,345
That's not fair. You had some.

294
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:15,449
I think Monica wouId be
very interested to know...

295
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:18,621
...that you caIIed her cheesecake
''dry and meaIy.''

296
00:17:18,856 --> 00:17:21,051
What do we use to spIit it?

297
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:25,629
AII right, pick a haIf.

298
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:29,791
WeII, this side Iooks bigger.

299
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:34,164
But there's more crust on this side.

300
00:17:34,438 --> 00:17:36,133
Maybe if I measure it--

301
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:37,567
Pick a piece!

302
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:41,676
-AII right, I pick that one.
-It's the smaIIer piece.

303
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:44,280
Okay. There you go.

304
00:17:44,515 --> 00:17:47,507
Enjoy your haIf, my friend.
But that is it.

305
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:51,085
No sharing, no switching,
and don't come crying to me...

306
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:53,620
...if you eat your piece too fast.

307
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:07,898
-You gonna give me some of yours?
-Oh, no.

308
00:18:08,205 --> 00:18:12,335
No switching, no sharing.
And don't come crying to me.

309
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,474
I may just sit here
and have my cake aII day.

310
00:18:15,713 --> 00:18:18,807
Just sit here in the haIIway
and eat my--

311
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:32,662
Ross, sweetheart!

312
00:18:32,897 --> 00:18:34,762
Oh, hey, Aunt MiIIie.

313
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:39,025
-Isn't it a beautifuI wedding?
-Yes, it is.

314
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:45,638
Every time, on the Iips!

315
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,844
Why? Why on the Iips?

316
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:53,641
There's Frannie.
Won't she be happy to see me?

317
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,715
You be nice, aII right?

318
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,252
I didn't bring you to ambush her.

319
00:18:58,522 --> 00:19:01,650
Frannie was the one
who showed your <i>Playboys</i> to Mom.

320
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,860
That bitch.

321
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:09,393
Monica!

322
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:10,861
What--?

323
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:13,535
Am I doing here?
Surprised to see me?

324
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:16,171
Ross brought me.
How do you Iike that?

325
00:19:16,373 --> 00:19:18,864
Hi, Frannie. CongratuIations.

326
00:19:20,678 --> 00:19:23,875
You invite my whoIe famiIy,
and not me? Why?

327
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:27,572
Why wouIdn't you want me here?
What couId I have done?

328
00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:30,949
Stuart!

329
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:33,979
I beIieve you know my husband.

330
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:39,490
So it's reaIIy a <i>q</i>uestion
of ''who'' couId you have done.

331
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:50,504
I hate this, but I have to go.

332
00:19:50,741 --> 00:19:52,902
I can't miss my fIight.

333
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:55,475
I bet there's
another fIight to Minsk in--

334
00:19:55,746 --> 00:19:57,441
JuIy.

335
00:20:06,924 --> 00:20:09,654
That's reaIIy beautifuI.
What does it mean?

336
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:12,452
''PIease cIean my beakers.''

337
00:20:13,163 --> 00:20:15,097
I don't get out of the Iab much.

338
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:20,361
I thought it meant something eIse.

339
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:24,165
Yeah, weII, I reaIIy actuaIIy
wanted to say...

340
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:25,931
...that.

341
00:20:26,176 --> 00:20:29,612
But I figured I probabIy shouIdn't
because...

342
00:20:30,614 --> 00:20:32,343
...I have to Ieave.

343
00:20:32,616 --> 00:20:35,107
No, you're right. Don't say it.

344
00:20:36,787 --> 00:20:38,982
I do, though.

345
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:42,525
I do too.

346
00:20:51,302 --> 00:20:53,133
WeII, bye, Phoebe.

347
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:08,012
Now's not the time, Joey.
You can yeII at me tomorrow.

348
00:21:08,285 --> 00:21:11,049
Wait, no, Pheebs.
I'm not gonna yeII at you.

349
00:21:11,322 --> 00:21:13,882
I just started thinking
about you and David...

350
00:21:14,158 --> 00:21:18,322
...and I remember how bummed you were
the first time he Ieft.

351
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:22,555
Oh, Pheebs, come here.

352
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,029
-Are you okay?
-No, I'm not okay.

353
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:31,101
The onIy guy I've ever been
crazy about is going to Minsk...

354
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,037
...and I may never see him again.

355
00:21:34,445 --> 00:21:36,072
You couId aIways visit him.

356
00:21:36,313 --> 00:21:38,907
Right. Like they'II Iet me
have a passport.

357
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,083
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.

358
00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:47,047
WeII, now...

359
00:21:47,324 --> 00:21:51,385
...if you achieve distiIIation of
subatomic particIes before he does...

360
00:21:51,628 --> 00:21:53,425
...then he couId come back.

361
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:02,402
I couId give it a shot.

362
00:22:07,544 --> 00:22:10,945
Oh, Iook! There's a piece
that doesn't have fIoor on it.

363
00:22:11,215 --> 00:22:14,878
-Stick to your side!
-Come on, now!

364
00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:28,062
AII right, what are we having?

365
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:38,934
-Oh, wait, I forgot my wrap.
-Oh, I'II wait here for you.

366
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,202
-I can't go back there!
-Why?

367
00:22:41,545 --> 00:22:45,037
Did you see the way Stuart was staring
at me? I think he stiII wants me.

368
00:22:45,215 --> 00:22:47,706
-Oh, my God.
-Just go do it!

369
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:50,217
AII right, wait here.

370
00:23:07,905 --> 00:23:10,373
Hi, sweetie! Are you Ieaving?

371
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:13,235
-WeII--
-Give us a kiss. Come on.

372
00:23:22,085 --> 00:23:25,851
Why? Why on the Iips?

373
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:33,919
