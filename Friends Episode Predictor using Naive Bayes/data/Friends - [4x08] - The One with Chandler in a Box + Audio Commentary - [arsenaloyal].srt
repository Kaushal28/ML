1
00:00:05,183 --> 00:00:07,845
<i>It's me. I know you</i>
<i>can't stand to see me.</i>

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,612
<i>I'm trying to apologize</i>
<i>over the phone</i>--

3
00:00:19,164 --> 00:00:22,099
<i>I shouldn't have kissed</i>
<i>your girlfriend</i>--

4
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:27,131
Stop calling!

5
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:31,469
<i>This is 92.3 WXRK, K-Rock...</i>

6
00:00:31,677 --> 00:00:34,202
<i>...calling with our $ 1 OOO</i>
<i>daily challenge!</i>

7
00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:35,673
All right!

8
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:37,007
<i>What is the name of...</i>

9
00:00:37,282 --> 00:00:41,446
<i>...your roommate who is very sorry</i>
<i>and would do anything</i>--<i>?</i>

10
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:50,495
-Damn it, Chandler, stop calling.
-Joey, it's Ross.

11
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:51,822
-Sorry.
-lt's all right.

12
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:53,056
What's up?

13
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:59,159
Not much. l got Chandler
here and he's really, really sorry--

14
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:01,796
The One with Chandler in a Box

15
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:48,151
Oh, turkey!

16
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,082
Giving thanks!

17
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,857
Look, everyone.
lt's the spirit of Thanksgiving!

18
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:57,319
Are things with Joey better?

19
00:01:57,562 --> 00:02:00,292
They couldn't be worse.
l spent eight hours calling him...

20
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:02,432
...trying to get him
to talk to me.

21
00:02:04,136 --> 00:02:05,228
Eight hours.

22
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,201
You could probably use
a plug-in telephone headset.

23
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:13,775
Should we all expect Christmas gifts
that are stolen from your office?

24
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:17,473
You shouldn't.

25
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:20,645
Speaking of Christmas....

26
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:24,788
Since Monica and l are starting
a new business and have no money...

27
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:29,653
...this year we could do Secret Santa
and each only buy one gift.

28
00:02:29,928 --> 00:02:33,125
And there's the added mystery
of who gets who.

29
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,397
Who gets whom.

30
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:40,628
l don't know why l do that.

31
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,104
But it is correct.

32
00:02:45,243 --> 00:02:48,303
Hey, what's this?
lt's all of your names.

33
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:50,574
Let's pick.

34
00:02:52,017 --> 00:02:54,178
Hey, what's going--?

35
00:02:56,021 --> 00:03:00,151
-No, Joey, stay.
-We're picking names for Secret Santa.

36
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:02,293
Okay.

37
00:03:02,728 --> 00:03:05,561
l invented Secret Santa, you know.

38
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:10,899
What are you laughing at? You're the
one who said <i>Die Hard</i> was your idea.

39
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:13,299
lt was.

40
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:17,473
Don't make me show you the napkin.

41
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:26,676
l'm going to take a nap.
Turkey makes me sleepy.

42
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:28,746
We haven't eaten yet.

43
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:33,857
l know, but all that work
you're doing to get it ready and....

44
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:39,427
Did you pick Rachel for your
Secret Santa? l'll trade for her.

45
00:03:39,831 --> 00:03:43,198
l picked her.
Thank God, you want her!

46
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:45,833
Why do you want to get
rid of her so badly?

47
00:03:46,037 --> 00:03:47,971
She exchanges every gift she gets.

48
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:50,606
lt's impossible to get her
something she likes.

49
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:52,333
Come on, let's trade!

50
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:55,307
l got her that backpack
and she loved it.

51
00:03:55,514 --> 00:03:58,381
l remember she cried
when that big dog ran off with--

52
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:03,350
There was no big dog.

53
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:09,389
This sucks! l already got her
a briefcase with ''R.G.'' put on it.

54
00:04:09,861 --> 00:04:12,159
Her initials.

55
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:16,523
Okay, l'm really bad at initials.

56
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,066
You got your shopping done early.

57
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:22,833
Yeah, well, my Camel Cash
was about to expire.

58
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:26,301
Maybe you can give it to somebody
else. Like Ross Geller!

59
00:04:27,145 --> 00:04:29,477
You know what?
lt's a girlie briefcase.

60
00:04:29,948 --> 00:04:33,213
Who cares!
He works in a museum.

61
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:36,747
The big game's about to start!

62
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:40,118
Ross and Joey aren't here.
You can watch the parade if you want.

63
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:42,021
Thanks.

64
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:45,187
What is wrong with this freezer?

65
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:49,265
-What happened?
-lce just got in my eye!

66
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:52,927
People are trying
to sleep in here!

67
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:55,070
Monica got ice in her eye
and it hurts!

68
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,241
-Open it up. Let me see.
-l can't. lt really kills.

69
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,070
Maybe you should put
some ice on it.

70
00:05:02,948 --> 00:05:05,610
-lt looks bad.
-We should take you to a doctor.

71
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:07,680
No, my eye doctor is Richard!

72
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:10,751
l can't go to him
when l don't have a boyfriend.

73
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:13,655
He's really picky about his patients.

74
00:05:14,326 --> 00:05:16,817
You've got to go.
What's his office number?

75
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:19,695
Like l remember his office number!

76
00:05:19,898 --> 00:05:21,388
Speed dial seven.

77
00:05:24,102 --> 00:05:27,037
l'm calling on behalf
of Monica Geller's eye.

78
00:05:28,473 --> 00:05:31,135
ls Richard Burke in today?

79
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,074
He's not in. Will she
see the on-call doctor?

80
00:05:34,312 --> 00:05:37,577
-Yes.
-She's very excited about that!

81
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:40,147
Okay, we'll be right in.

82
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:42,253
Okay, so who's gonna take her in?

83
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,412
l'll go, you can watch your parade.

84
00:05:49,594 --> 00:05:53,792
lt's so cool.
Till Monica gets back, l'm head chef.

85
00:05:54,032 --> 00:05:56,523
And l get to make all the decisions.

86
00:05:57,502 --> 00:06:00,369
She told you to follow
the recipe exactly.

87
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,334
Get out of my kitchen.

88
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:07,011
l think l'm making
some progress with Joey.

89
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:09,772
When l walked in,
he went to his bedroom...

90
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:12,984
...but he only slammed the door once.

91
00:06:13,151 --> 00:06:15,915
Yeah, he gave me the finger
while doing it.

92
00:06:16,955 --> 00:06:21,415
l've got to call my mom and
ask her a left-handed cooking question.

93
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:26,359
l'm gonna be in there.

94
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:28,895
While l'm gone....

95
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:34,133
Chandler, you're in charge.

96
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:40,567
l picked Monica for Secret Santa, but
l'm getting her something for Hanukkah.

97
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:42,506
You want to switch?

98
00:06:43,014 --> 00:06:45,312
l was trying to trade...

99
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,574
...for you.

100
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:51,854
Really? That's so nice.
What are you getting me?

101
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:56,858
l don't know, R.G. l was thinking
something girlie for your office.

102
00:06:57,829 --> 00:07:00,593
Maybe Phoebe will switch with me.

103
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:05,165
Then you'll get stuck with Rachel,
and she exchanges every gift.

104
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:08,236
No, l got her lots of stuff
she never took back.

105
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:09,495
Like?

106
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,233
Like that gold necklace
l got her last year.

107
00:07:12,444 --> 00:07:13,843
When did she wear it last?

108
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:18,282
She wore it all Christmas day
and then....

109
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,543
Big dog?

110
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,683
What are you doing?

111
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:31,418
Sending back this stuff
Chandler bought.

112
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,725
-Even the TV?
-No, l'll put that in my room.

113
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:41,565
Listen, Joey.
l know what he did was wrong.

114
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:43,535
But can't you hear him out?

115
00:07:44,142 --> 00:07:47,771
lf Chandler had kissed Rachel,
would you hear him out?

116
00:07:48,713 --> 00:07:50,237
That's a good point.

117
00:07:51,282 --> 00:07:53,614
How long you going to punish him?

118
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:55,410
Five years.

119
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:57,610
You've sentenced him?

120
00:07:58,023 --> 00:08:00,856
Don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

121
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:03,020
The guy's your best friend.

122
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:05,125
Was my best friend.

123
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,298
l don't know why
you're pushing for him.

124
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,161
With him out of the way as
my best friend, there's a spot open.

125
00:08:13,538 --> 00:08:16,063
-Who, me?
-Yeah.

126
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:21,044
l'm honored. You know what
l'm going to do as your best friend?

127
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:23,812
l'm going to get you
to talk to Chandler.

128
00:08:25,617 --> 00:08:27,141
All right.

129
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:30,049
But if you weren't
my best friend....

130
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,690
Oh, my God. ls it really that bad?

131
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,154
l walk in the room,
and he won't talk to me.

132
00:08:37,362 --> 00:08:40,331
He just mumbles something in ltalian.

133
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:44,229
And l know he only knows
the bad words.

134
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:49,700
l'm so, so sorry.
l feel responsible.

135
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:52,002
lt's not your fault.

136
00:08:54,712 --> 00:08:59,479
-Gunther, have you seen Chandler?
-l thought you were Chandler.

137
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,184
But one of you is over there.

138
00:09:12,564 --> 00:09:14,862
Hey, Joe.

139
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:26,874
l'll be right with you.
Thanks for coming in.

140
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:32,076
Oh, my God!
How cute is the on-call doctor?

141
00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:36,452
So cute that l'm thinking
about jamming this pen in my eye.

142
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:50,096
-You have the best luck with eye doctors.
-l know.

143
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:53,134
Dr. Burke will see you now.

144
00:09:53,338 --> 00:09:57,035
Not Dr. Burke.
The on-call doctor will see me now.

145
00:09:57,442 --> 00:09:58,704
Dr. Richard Burke is out.

146
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:02,208
Dr. Timothy Burke, his son,
will see you now.

147
00:10:03,848 --> 00:10:05,543
Ready?

148
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:14,414
Hey, l'm sorry. That--

149
00:10:15,894 --> 00:10:18,590
-Where you going?
-My folks' .

150
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:22,089
When you coming back?

151
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:26,770
l don't know. l might stay there
while l look for an apartment.

152
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:28,761
What?

153
00:10:29,307 --> 00:10:33,641
l thought we could talk
about this. Work it out.

154
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:35,836
Seeing you two together, l don't....

155
00:10:36,114 --> 00:10:39,345
What do you want me to say?
Should l stop seeing her?

156
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:42,075
lt's not about her. Okay?

157
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:45,789
But seeing you together
reminds me of what you did.

158
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:50,584
l won't live with someone who doesn't
know what it is to be a friend.

159
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:54,923
l know what it is to be a friend.
l screwed up.

160
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,656
Yeah, you did.

161
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:59,660
And that's why l'm leaving.

162
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:05,099
lf you're not going to stay for me,
then at least stay for them.

163
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:10,008
They had a very difficult year.
What with the robbery and all.

164
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:13,442
And that chick used to be very cute.

165
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:15,176
When that guy was robbing us...

166
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:18,219
...and l was locked in the
entertainment unit for six hours...

167
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:20,017
...do you know what l was doing?

168
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,782
l was thinking about
how l let you down.

169
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:29,291
lf l knew what kind of friend
you'd be, l wouldn't have worried.

170
00:11:30,868 --> 00:11:34,565
Wait one second! There has
to be something that l can do.

171
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:36,171
lf we still had that unit...

172
00:11:36,374 --> 00:11:41,107
...l'd get in it for six hours
and think about how l let you down.

173
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:46,806
What?

174
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:48,712
We got a box.

175
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,088
l remember the last time l saw you.

176
00:11:55,393 --> 00:11:57,623
lt was the morning l left for college.

177
00:11:58,496 --> 00:12:00,930
You were standing
outside the Dairy Queen.

178
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:04,829
Just probably waiting for it to open.

179
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:09,295
-You look great now.
-You look great too.

180
00:12:09,774 --> 00:12:11,765
You're an excellent patient.

181
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:13,833
How does it look?

182
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,174
You have a scratch on your cornea.
You have to wear a patch.

183
00:12:18,483 --> 00:12:20,178
Like a pirate?

184
00:12:20,952 --> 00:12:22,647
lf that helps you.

185
00:12:26,991 --> 00:12:29,960
How long have you been working
with your dad?

186
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:33,259
Come on, one of us had to mention him.

187
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:36,589
l moved back here a couple months ago.

188
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:40,103
Big family dinner tonight?

189
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:42,832
No way!

190
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,669
l was gonna have Thanksgiving
at my girlfriend's.

191
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:47,501
But we broke up.

192
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:52,711
She wasn't ready
for a serious commitment.

193
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:58,255
So you made her walk the plank,
aye, matey?

194
00:12:59,424 --> 00:13:00,948
You're not wearing the patch yet.

195
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:06,056
l know.

196
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:14,761
-He's coming here for Thanksgiving?
-l know. lt's sick.

197
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:17,801
-Why is it sick?
-lt's Richard's son!

198
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:21,911
lt's like inviting
a Greek tragedy over for dinner.

199
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,611
lf it were Greek,
l'd be blind in both eyes.

200
00:13:26,117 --> 00:13:31,054
l like him because he's handsome and
he's nice and smart and handsome.

201
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,158
Phoebe, you understand, don't you?

202
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,523
l could see where l'd be
your best shot, but no.

203
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:42,259
Sorry, honey. l think it's twisted.

204
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:45,263
-What's twisted?
-Me going out with Richard's son.

205
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:53,268
lt sounds like a really bad idea to me.

206
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:59,948
-ls he okay in there?
-He's fine!

207
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:03,349
lf things work out
between you and Richard's son...

208
00:14:03,554 --> 00:14:05,181
...you can tell your kids...

209
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,881
...that you slept
with their grandfather.

210
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:11,126
Judge all you want to.

211
00:14:11,396 --> 00:14:13,694
Married a lesbian,
left a man at the altar...

212
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:15,432
...loved a gay ice dancer...

213
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,694
...threw a girl's wooden leg
in the fire, live in a box!

214
00:14:25,676 --> 00:14:28,736
What exactly is the point of the box?

215
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:34,110
The meaning of the box is threefold.

216
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:38,746
One, it gives me the time
to think about what l did.

217
00:14:39,123 --> 00:14:43,890
Two, it proves how much l care
about my friendship with Joey.

218
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:46,052
And three...

219
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:49,393
...it hurts.

220
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:52,995
And if he stays in the box
you guys will be friends again?

221
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:55,965
Let's just say it's a start.

222
00:14:56,441 --> 00:15:00,605
Remember that necklace
l gave you last year?

223
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:02,439
Can l see it?

224
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:04,511
Why?

225
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:07,044
l just want to check something.

226
00:15:07,485 --> 00:15:08,952
Okay.

227
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:13,689
Now we'll see.

228
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:16,416
Air hole! Air hole!

229
00:15:18,262 --> 00:15:21,425
Here it is. l love it.
l wear it all the time.

230
00:15:24,802 --> 00:15:27,965
The necklace l got you was gold.
This is silver.

231
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,642
Well, maybe...

232
00:15:33,644 --> 00:15:35,043
...it changed.

233
00:15:35,913 --> 00:15:38,711
Oh, my God!
You actually exchanged it.

234
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,113
lsn't it better to exchange it
for something l enjoy...

235
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,651
...and can use a lot?

236
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:45,613
What did you get?

237
00:15:45,823 --> 00:15:47,450
Credit.

238
00:15:50,094 --> 00:15:53,530
l'll get it. l'll get it. l'll get it.
l'll get it. l'll get it.

239
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:58,497
Hi, Tim.

240
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:02,199
Thank you.
Come meet my friends.

241
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,099
Phoebe.

242
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:06,605
And Joey.

243
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:08,436
My brother, Ross.

244
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:10,271
And Rachel.

245
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:14,718
That's Chandler.

246
00:16:14,952 --> 00:16:16,419
How do you do?

247
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:20,620
-What's--?
-Well, he's....

248
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:23,088
He's doing some thinking.

249
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:31,592
-What happened?
-You kissed my girlfriend!

250
00:16:36,274 --> 00:16:37,536
l like those sunglasses.

251
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:43,240
''Like them'' like them? Or ''l'd like
to get store credit'' like them?

252
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:52,047
This turkey is ready.

253
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,219
Where can l wash up?

254
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:56,254
Let me show you.

255
00:16:56,727 --> 00:16:58,490
The towels are hanging next
to the sink.

256
00:16:58,863 --> 00:17:01,730
-And you can use the fancy soap.
-Thank you.

257
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:06,563
Fancy soap? l thought we were
saving that for the pope.

258
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,668
See. He's nice, right?

259
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:13,035
Do you want a relationship
where you can actually say:

260
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:15,939
''That's not how your dad
used to do it''?

261
00:17:20,585 --> 00:17:23,247
Everything looks great.
Where should l sit?

262
00:17:23,454 --> 00:17:24,443
Saved you a seat.

263
00:17:25,556 --> 00:17:27,421
Sick, sick, sick, sick.

264
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:31,217
l'll get it.

265
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:33,223
Got you!

266
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:38,224
That doesn't sound
like thinking to me.

267
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:42,038
-Sorry!
-You shouldn't be talking at all.

268
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:45,402
You've got too much thinking to do
to be talking and joking.

269
00:17:45,743 --> 00:17:47,404
Okay, you got it!

270
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:49,375
Ross, pass me the yams?

271
00:17:50,114 --> 00:17:54,210
Joey's got the mashed potatoes
if you want to exchange them.

272
00:17:58,055 --> 00:18:00,285
Will you stop!
What's the matter with you?

273
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:03,155
We've got company.

274
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:06,392
Nothing's the matter with me.

275
00:18:06,564 --> 00:18:10,557
l'm not completely devoid of sentiment.
l have feelings.

276
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:13,599
Okay, fine.

277
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:23,375
You can't tell, but l'm breaking
the tension by mooning you guys.

278
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,915
All right, look!

279
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:34,088
lf this is a big joke to you,
forget about it.

280
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:36,316
This means something to me.

281
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:39,462
lf it doesn't mean anything to you,
then get out of there.

282
00:18:39,664 --> 00:18:41,894
Otherwise, you're just
an idiot in a box.

283
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,697
You're right. l'm sorry.
This means a lot to me.

284
00:18:45,903 --> 00:18:50,237
l want to be friends again.
l swear l won't say another word.

285
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:53,771
-So you'll take this seriously?
-Absolutely!

286
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:56,341
That sounds like another word to me.

287
00:18:57,348 --> 00:18:59,612
Are you going to take this seriously?

288
00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:05,054
Okay!

289
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:10,025
Don't say that l have no sentiment.

290
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:13,930
This is a movie stub
from our first date.

291
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:18,101
This eggshell is from the first time
you made me breakfast in bed.

292
00:19:18,703 --> 00:19:22,833
This is from the museum,
the first time we...

293
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:24,540
...were together.

294
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:30,346
Maybe l exchange gifts sometimes,
but l keep the things that matter.

295
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:33,947
l don't know what to say.
l'm sorry.

296
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:39,012
Though you're not
supposed to take these.

297
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:44,560
lt's, like, a million years old.

298
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:49,897
We actually have people
looking for that.

299
00:19:56,073 --> 00:19:59,133
-Mind if l smoke?
-Care if l die?

300
00:19:59,276 --> 00:20:03,042
No, l'm just kidding, l'm just kidding.
Go ahead, smoke.

301
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,738
This always happens.

302
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:06,782
Here, let me.

303
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:08,841
Thank you.

304
00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:14,357
You have very beautiful...

305
00:20:15,192 --> 00:20:16,784
...eye.

306
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:20,391
My friends think this is weird.

307
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:23,431
Even the one in the box?

308
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:25,461
lt's not weird, is it?

309
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:30,163
l thought it would be. l almost
canceled, but it really isn't.

310
00:20:30,674 --> 00:20:34,075
l know. Me and your dad,
that's totally separate.

311
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:36,279
l totally agree.

312
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:39,572
We're two people
who find each other...

313
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,918
...very attractive.

314
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,609
Right?

315
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:57,592
-What?
-Nothing, nothing.

316
00:20:57,935 --> 00:21:00,631
No, really.
Was that not okay?

317
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:02,133
No, that was good.

318
00:21:02,873 --> 00:21:04,864
That was a good kiss.

319
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,273
-lt reminded you of--
-Don't say it!

320
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,105
-lt did, didn't it?
-Yes!

321
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:14,645
l know!

322
00:21:17,454 --> 00:21:21,083
God, l am sorry. l am so sorry.

323
00:21:21,225 --> 00:21:26,253
lt's okay. lt wouldn't be Thanksgiving
without a little emotional scarring.

324
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:29,190
You know what's even worse?

325
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,857
My friends were right.

326
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:36,962
You know what's worst for me is you remind
me of a younger version of my mom.

327
00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:02,923
-l want you to know how sorry l am--
-lt's okay.

328
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:07,661
-Chandler's the one l'm mad at.
-Well, l'm still sorry.

329
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:11,505
-ls he here?
-ln the box.

330
00:22:20,684 --> 00:22:23,175
He can't talk right now.

331
00:22:24,054 --> 00:22:25,544
Why not? What's going on?

332
00:22:25,923 --> 00:22:28,687
He's trying to show Joey
how much he means to him.

333
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,954
-By being in a box?
-Joey had reasons.

334
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:35,929
They were threefold.

335
00:22:41,305 --> 00:22:45,799
You not being able to talk
might make this easier.

336
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:47,943
Listen....

337
00:22:58,022 --> 00:23:02,959
l don't want to be someone
who comes between two best friends.

338
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:07,956
l can't stand seeing
what this is doing to you guys.

339
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:11,163
And l don't want to be
the cause of that.

340
00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:14,667
l don't think we can see
each other anymore.

341
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:18,238
l'm going to my mom's in Chicago.

342
00:23:18,642 --> 00:23:21,076
l'm going to stay there for a while.

343
00:23:26,183 --> 00:23:29,880
l think this could have been
