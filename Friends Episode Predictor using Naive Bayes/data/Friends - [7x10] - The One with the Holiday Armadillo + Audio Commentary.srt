1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,041
Bye-bye.

2
00:00:03,415 --> 00:00:05,542
I just got us reservations
at MicheIIe's...

3
00:00:05,751 --> 00:00:07,878
...and tickets to <i>The Music Man</i>
to ceIebrate...

4
00:00:08,053 --> 00:00:10,715
...our first hoIiday season
as a betrothed coupIe.

5
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:13,892
-''Betrothed.''
-Betrothed coupIe.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,259
-Hey!
-Hi!

7
00:00:22,968 --> 00:00:24,094
Pheebs?

8
00:00:24,336 --> 00:00:25,860
SkuII?

9
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:27,368
Yeah, it's my mom's.

10
00:00:27,573 --> 00:00:29,097
Oh, my God!

11
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:31,834
No, no, no. It's not my mom.

12
00:00:32,044 --> 00:00:34,535
It beIonged to my mom.

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,346
She used to put it out
every Christmas...

14
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:41,849
...to remind us that even though
it's Christmas, peopIe stiII die.

15
00:00:42,754 --> 00:00:45,382
And you can put candy in it.

16
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:49,685
-Hey.
-Hey.

17
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:50,951
Licorice?

18
00:00:52,464 --> 00:00:53,726
Sure.

19
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:57,664
-I get Ben for the hoIidays this year.
-That's great!

20
00:00:57,903 --> 00:01:00,463
-Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
-Nope.

21
00:01:00,706 --> 00:01:02,469
I mean,
I know Susan does every year...

22
00:01:02,674 --> 00:01:05,575
...but I want to take this year
to teach him about Hanukkah.

23
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:07,142
And maybe I couId teach Ben...

24
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:10,179
...about the Christmas skuII
and how peopIe die.

25
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:14,378
You may need to use this year
to teach Ben about Phoebe.

26
00:01:18,357 --> 00:01:19,619
Hey.

27
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:27,695
-Did you know he was in there?
-No.

28
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:31,931
-How Iong have we been home?
-About haIf an hour.

29
00:01:32,204 --> 00:01:33,432
LoveIy.

30
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:37,334
The One With The HoIiday ArmadiIIo

31
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:15,671
You know what I was thinking?
When we get married, are you gonna...

32
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:17,439
...change your Iast name to ''Bing''?

33
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,744
No.

34
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,910
Why not?

35
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:25,120
''Bing'' is weird.

36
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:29,389
Yeah, I know what you mean. GeIIar!

37
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:33,530
Oh, hey, you guys.

38
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:38,468
Guess what. My IandIord just caIIed.
My apartment's gonna be ready soon.

39
00:02:38,637 --> 00:02:40,161
So I guess I'II be moving out.

40
00:02:40,405 --> 00:02:42,032
Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,140
Yes, you wiII be very sad.

42
00:02:45,777 --> 00:02:49,838
-I gotta go teII RacheI the good news.
-You guys are gonna Iive together again?

43
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:52,778
-Yeah, why not?
-She's just having so much fun with Joey...

44
00:02:52,984 --> 00:02:55,282
...I just assumed she'd stiII
be Iiving with him.

45
00:02:55,454 --> 00:02:58,150
Why do you think she's having
so much fun Iiving with Joey?

46
00:02:58,323 --> 00:03:00,621
No reason, e<i>x</i>cept she...

47
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:02,588
...toId me.

48
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:05,493
ReaIIy? She said she didn't want
to Iive with me?

49
00:03:05,764 --> 00:03:08,426
No. No, she didn't say that.

50
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:11,329
I think you shouId taIk to Monica now.

51
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:15,498
Phoebe, don't worry. I'm sure
she wants to Iive with you.

52
00:03:15,707 --> 00:03:17,299
You're sure?
You're absoIuteIy sure?

53
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:19,876
No, but I'II bet she probabIy does.

54
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:21,204
Oh, probabIy?

55
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,777
I don't Iike that word.

56
00:03:24,182 --> 00:03:27,640
I know what ''probabIy'' reaIIy means.
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:30,719
''Oh, your mom
probabIy won't kiII herseIf.''

58
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:35,750
You know, ''No, the funeraI director
probabIy won't hit on you.''

59
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:40,523
''Yeah, that nice coupIe probabIy
wiII adopt you.'' Okay, I'm sorry.

60
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,892
I'm sorry,
but I'm not hanging aII my hopes...

61
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:46,128
...of RacheI and I Iiving together
on ''probabIy.''

62
00:03:46,404 --> 00:03:48,964
You gotta take care of yourseIf
in this worId.

63
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:51,472
History teaches us nothing.

64
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:56,808
''Bing'' doesn't seem so weird now,
does it?

65
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:03,543
Great, you're home.

66
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:06,087
Guess what Phoebe got me
for Christmas.

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,325
-Drums?
-No, drums!

68
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,935
Hi, couId we get
two burritos to go, pIease?

69
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,913
I'm sorry. But not that sorry,
because you don't have to Iive with it.

70
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,483
We have a reservation under
the name ChandIer Bing.

71
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:38,350
Okay, we'II have a tabIe for you
in about 45 minutes.

72
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:41,515
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets
to <i>The Music Man</i> at 8.

73
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:44,524
I'm sorry.
Christmas is a very busy time, sir.

74
00:04:44,863 --> 00:04:46,956
Is this because of the burrito thing?

75
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:52,831
-You need to give him money.
-Give him money? It was a joke!

76
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:56,741
No. To get a tabIe. PIaces Iike this
are aIways shaking you down.

77
00:04:56,975 --> 00:05:00,308
-Everybody wants a payoff.
-AII right, caIm down, O'MaIIey.

78
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:05,645
-I'II sIip him some money.
-But you've got to be smooth about it.

79
00:05:05,884 --> 00:05:07,977
Hey, I can be smooth.

80
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:15,316
We're in a bit of a hurry,
so if you couId get us a tabIe...

81
00:05:15,493 --> 00:05:17,188
...a IittIe <i>q</i>uicker, I'd appreciate it.

82
00:05:17,362 --> 00:05:19,262
-Of course, sir.
-Okay.

83
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,498
-How'd it go?
-Had the money in the wrong hand.

84
00:05:31,176 --> 00:05:32,268
Hey. You don't feeI...

85
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:34,435
-...Iike you're gonna throw up, do you?
-No.

86
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:36,581
WeII, I do. So Iet's....

87
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,217
So, Ben, you....

88
00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:43,887
You know what hoIiday is coming up,
don't you?

89
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:45,044
Christmas.

90
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,418
Yeah, and you know what
other hoIiday is coming up?

91
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,957
Christmas Eve.

92
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:53,890
Yes, but aIso....

93
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:56,923
Hanukkah!

94
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,901
See, you're part Jewish,
and Hanukkah is a Jewish hoIiday.

95
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:04,803
Santa has reindeers that can fIy.

96
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:06,475
Right, but on Hanukkah--

97
00:06:06,745 --> 00:06:08,906
Hanukkah is a ceIebration
of a miracIe.

98
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,946
See, years and years ago, there were
these peopIe caIIed the Maccabees.

99
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:16,548
Okay, that's right. Yes...

100
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:19,052
...but on Hanukkah, we sing:

101
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:27,897
Okay, it's not a contest.

102
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:29,991
When is Santa coming?

103
00:06:31,236 --> 00:06:34,763
How about this year,
instead of Santa...

104
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:37,702
...we have fun ceIebrating Hanukkah?

105
00:06:38,076 --> 00:06:39,668
No Santa?

106
00:06:39,844 --> 00:06:41,505
Was I bad?

107
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:45,805
No. Oh, no, no. Hey, you weren't bad.
You've been very good, Ben.

108
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:49,350
-Santa's mad at me.
-No, hey, hey, come on.

109
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:51,953
Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?

110
00:06:52,223 --> 00:06:54,282
You're his favorite IittIe guy.

111
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:55,959
So Santa's coming?

112
00:06:58,263 --> 00:06:59,787
Yes!

113
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:01,655
Santa's coming.

114
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,323
WiII he bring me an ant farm?

115
00:07:03,802 --> 00:07:05,394
WiII you keep it at Mommy's?

116
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,663
-Okay.
-Then sure!

117
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:14,641
Maybe this sIipping-him-money thing
is not gonna work.

118
00:07:14,813 --> 00:07:16,940
Maybe we shouId just wait.

119
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:20,778
You're the one who said you wouId die
if you didn't see <i>Music Man.</i>

120
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:23,485
I didn't say ''die.''

121
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:27,014
I said ''cry.''

122
00:07:27,993 --> 00:07:30,359
It's easy. Just keep it casuaI.

123
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:33,929
Give him a kind word,
shake his hand and give him the money.

124
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:37,068
-How do you know so much about this?
-I don't know.

125
00:07:37,936 --> 00:07:40,166
Richard used to do it, didn't he?

126
00:07:40,705 --> 00:07:43,105
We'd be eating our soup right now.

127
00:07:44,142 --> 00:07:46,440
Mustached bastard.

128
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,440
Okay, those peopIe just Ieft. Come on.
Quick, give him the money.

129
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:53,272
E<i>x</i>cuse me.

130
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:02,893
We're in a bit of a hurry.
Can we...?

131
00:08:21,613 --> 00:08:23,638
So you Iike the drums.

132
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:25,780
That's great.

133
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:29,910
You know, I was worried that
they wouId create maybe...

134
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:32,147
...an unbearabIe Iiving situation.

135
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:36,419
But, okay, weII, apparentIy not.
So, yay!

136
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:38,691
Hey, Pheebs,
we aIready Iearned a song.

137
00:08:38,863 --> 00:08:42,321
Ready? One, two, three, four.

138
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:46,069
Te<i>q</i>uiIa!

139
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:49,499
That's fun.

140
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:57,370
Here you go.

141
00:08:57,715 --> 00:08:59,683
Thank you, Gunther.
Put her there.

142
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,314
DefiniteIy not easier with coins.

143
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:07,990
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

144
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:11,923
-Hey, Pheebs.
-Hey.

145
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:15,123
Here. Now I onIy owe you 49.50.

146
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:18,132
Hey, Pheebs...

147
00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:22,137
...if you want to get Joey a Christmas
present that disrupts the entire buiIding...

148
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:24,398
...why not get him something more subtIe...

149
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:25,770
...Iike a wrecking baII...

150
00:09:25,944 --> 00:09:29,607
...or a viaI of smaIIpo<i>x</i>
to reIease in the haIIway?

151
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:32,715
It's not just the drum noise.
Every five minutes...

152
00:09:32,884 --> 00:09:34,647
...Joey throws his sticks
in the air...

153
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:38,380
...and I have to hear:
''Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye!''

154
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:41,181
-I mean, it is so annoying.
-Yes, thank you.

155
00:09:41,426 --> 00:09:45,988
You see, this is how normaI peopIe
are supposed to react to drums.

156
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:49,923
Phoebe, you got Joey drums
to annoy RacheI...

157
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:52,661
...so she wouIdn't want
to Iive there anymore?

158
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:54,832
Maybe on some IeveI.

159
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:06,545
Joey, you know that you couId just
not throw the sticks up in the air.

160
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:08,742
What is rock 'n' roII about that?

161
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:13,922
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.

162
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:17,693
HoId it!
Before you teII me what it is....

163
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:22,722
Okay, what is it?

164
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:24,163
It's a...

165
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:25,700
...tarantuIa!

166
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:34,972
God, RacheI, I'm sorry.
What was I thinking...

167
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:38,307
...giving Joey this big, gross,
scary spider...

168
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:42,075
...in such a poorIy constructed cage?

169
00:10:42,787 --> 00:10:45,381
What are you taIking about?
I Iove them.

170
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:51,493
I had a tarantuIa when I was a kid.
But it died because my cat ate it.

171
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:54,393
And then my cat died.

172
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:56,557
But, Joey, isn't this cooI?

173
00:10:56,768 --> 00:10:59,601
Is it on me?
I feeI Iike it's on me. I got--

174
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:04,098
Oh, isn't that adorabIe?

175
00:11:04,342 --> 00:11:07,402
Joey is afraid of the tarantuIa.

176
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:09,011
He's so adorabIe.

177
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,408
God, he's just so much fun.

178
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:13,312
Joey's the best.
I'm gIad you're having so much fun here.

179
00:11:13,518 --> 00:11:14,746
Wait a minute.

180
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:16,146
What's the matter?

181
00:11:16,988 --> 00:11:18,478
Our apartment is ready.

182
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:23,260
And that makes you angry because...?

183
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:26,086
Because you'd rather
Iive here with Joey.

184
00:11:26,497 --> 00:11:29,022
-Where did you get that?
-Monica and ChandIer...

185
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,600
...said that you were having
so much fun here...

186
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:36,502
...and apparentIy no amount of drums
or tarantuIa is gonna change that.

187
00:11:38,343 --> 00:11:40,811
Phoebe,
did you get aII this stuff for Joey...

188
00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:43,140
...to try and drive me out
of the apartment?

189
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:46,740
You might as weII have just
gotten him a fish.

190
00:11:46,985 --> 00:11:49,283
You know how fish freak me out.

191
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:51,749
Fish.

192
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:56,354
But it wouIdn't have mattered.
You and I are gonna Iive together.

193
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:58,051
We're roommates.
That's the deaI.

194
00:11:58,229 --> 00:12:00,891
Yes, but I wanted you to want
to Iive with me.

195
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:03,761
But, okay, if you're having
so much fun over here--

196
00:12:04,202 --> 00:12:06,067
It's so much more fun with you.

197
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:09,000
-We did have fun, didn't we?
-We had so much fun.

198
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:11,698
Remember the time we were pIaying
with the SuperBaII...

199
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:15,368
...and we accidentaIIy threw it through
the window and it broke?

200
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:19,879
I remember paying for the window,
but I don't remember how it broke.

201
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:23,411
Yeah, stuff Iike that.

202
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:26,986
WeII, anyway, they say, if we want,
we couId see it tonight.

203
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:29,326
-I wouId Iove to.
-Yay, okay!

204
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,461
-Good, good, good.
-Great. AII right. Good.

205
00:12:32,697 --> 00:12:35,461
And Monica asked me
to make the drumming stop.

206
00:12:40,805 --> 00:12:42,238
Done.

207
00:12:49,314 --> 00:12:51,748
HeIIo, sir.
You here to return those pants?

208
00:12:58,056 --> 00:13:00,388
No, these are my pants.

209
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:03,716
Okay.

210
00:13:04,095 --> 00:13:07,895
-How can I heIp you?
-Do you have a Santa outfit Ieft?

211
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:10,294
Two days before Christmas?
Sorry, man.

212
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:13,096
-Did you try Costume City?
-Yeah, I've tried everywhere.

213
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:16,934
-PIease, pIease. I mean, I'II pay e<i>x</i>tra.
-Sorry. But...

214
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:20,544
...I do have 74 of them
coming back on the 26th.

215
00:13:21,245 --> 00:13:24,942
Okay, Iook.
Do you have anything Christmas-y?

216
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:28,778
I promised my son, and I reaIIy
don't want to disappoint him.

217
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:32,045
Come on, you gotta have something.

218
00:13:32,857 --> 00:13:35,724
I'm the HoIiday ArmadiIIo!

219
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:39,927
I'm a friend of Santa's...

220
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:42,962
...and he sent me here to wish you...

221
00:13:43,234 --> 00:13:46,294
...a merry Christmas!

222
00:13:47,071 --> 00:13:50,598
What happened to Santa,
HoIiday ArmadiIIo?

223
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:54,243
Santa was unavaiIabIe...

224
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:57,380
...so cIose to Christmas.

225
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,906
Come in, have a seat.

226
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:04,052
You must be e<i>x</i>hausted,
coming aII the way from Te<i>x</i>as.

227
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:09,455
-Te<i>x</i>as?
-That's right, Ben.

228
00:14:09,694 --> 00:14:11,423
I'm Santa's representative...

229
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:15,496
...for aII the Southern states.

230
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:18,827
And Me<i>x</i>ico!

231
00:14:20,438 --> 00:14:21,962
But Santa sent me here...

232
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,801
...to give you these presents, Ben.

233
00:14:26,077 --> 00:14:29,274
Maybe the Iady wiII heIp me
with these presents.

234
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:45,956
Wow, thanks!

235
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,595
You're weIcome, Ben.

236
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,131
Merry Christmas.

237
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:54,302
And happy Hanukkah!

238
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:58,868
Are you for Hanukkah too?
Because I'm part Jewish.

239
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:02,440
You are? Me too.

240
00:15:03,181 --> 00:15:07,242
Because armadiIIos
aIso wandered in the desert?

241
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:11,451
You want to wander in the haII?

242
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:15,353
Hey, Ben!

243
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,755
What if the HoIiday ArmadiIIo...

244
00:15:17,995 --> 00:15:21,487
...toId you aII about
the FestivaI of Lights?

245
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:22,688
CooI!

246
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:24,525
Come on, Ben.

247
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,205
Years and years ago...

248
00:15:30,475 --> 00:15:32,670
...there were these peopIe caIIed...

249
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,003
-...the Maccabees!
-Ho, ho, ho!

250
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,043
Merry Christmas!

251
00:15:39,884 --> 00:15:41,647
-Santa!
-Hey!

252
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:46,286
What are you doing here, Santa?

253
00:15:48,426 --> 00:15:51,020
WeII, I'm here to see
my oId buddy Ben.

254
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:53,425
What are you doing here...

255
00:15:53,598 --> 00:15:57,500
...Weird TurtIe Man?

256
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,203
I'm the HoIiday ArmadiIIo...

257
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,739
...your part-Jewish friend.

258
00:16:07,245 --> 00:16:11,045
You sent me here
to give Ben some presents.

259
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:13,114
Remember?

260
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:15,541
What?

261
00:16:18,523 --> 00:16:20,718
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?

262
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:22,552
You bet I did, Ben.

263
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,819
Put her there.

264
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:34,196
WeII, it wouId have worked this time
if his hands weren't so damn smaII.

265
00:16:36,774 --> 00:16:39,368
Ho, ho, ho!

266
00:16:39,544 --> 00:16:41,512
Ben, why don't you come open
more presents.

267
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,443
Santa, the armadiIIo and I
wiII have a taIk in the kitchen.

268
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:47,744
There's a sentence
I never thought I'd say.

269
00:16:49,453 --> 00:16:50,886
What are you doing?

270
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:54,683
You caIIed everyone and said you were
having troubIe finding a Santa costume...

271
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:57,054
...so I borrowed one
from a guy at work.

272
00:16:57,261 --> 00:16:59,752
Thank you, but you gotta Ieave.

273
00:17:00,064 --> 00:17:01,429
-Why?
-Because...

274
00:17:01,632 --> 00:17:04,430
...I'm finaIIy getting him e<i>x</i>cited
about Hanukkah...

275
00:17:04,635 --> 00:17:06,000
...and you're wrecking it.

276
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:10,264
But I didn't get to shake my beIIy
Iike a bowIfuI of jeIIy.

277
00:17:13,477 --> 00:17:17,243
I'm sorry, ChandIer,
but this is reaIIy important to me.

278
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:21,514
Fine, I'II give the suit back.

279
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:25,681
Hey, you think you can keep it
another night?

280
00:17:28,092 --> 00:17:29,923
Santa? ReaIIy?

281
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:31,892
Yeah, is that okay?

282
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:35,760
Did your dad ever dress up Iike Santa?

283
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:40,300
-No.
-Then it's okay!

284
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:43,765
Okay, Ben. Santa has to go.

285
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:45,498
Say goodbye.

286
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,304
No, why does he have to go?

287
00:17:48,546 --> 00:17:52,812
Because if Santa and the HoIiday...

288
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:54,946
...ArmadiIIo...

289
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:59,487
...are ever in the same room
for too Iong...

290
00:17:59,724 --> 00:18:02,818
...the universe wiII impIode!

291
00:18:04,462 --> 00:18:06,794
Merry Christmas!

292
00:18:08,232 --> 00:18:12,032
No, why can't the armadiIIo Ieave?
I want Santa.

293
00:18:14,472 --> 00:18:16,167
Fine, I give up. Santa--

294
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,931
Santa can stay!

295
00:18:20,878 --> 00:18:21,867
WeII, I'II stay...

296
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:25,641
...but onIy because I want to hear
about Hanukkah.

297
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:29,018
Ben, wiII you sit here with Santa...

298
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:31,380
...and Iearn about Hanukkah?

299
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:33,682
Okay, Santa.

300
00:18:34,592 --> 00:18:36,219
-Thank you.
-You're weIcome.

301
00:18:36,494 --> 00:18:38,519
AII right, it's time...

302
00:18:38,763 --> 00:18:42,028
...for the story of Hanukkah.

303
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:44,362
Years and years ago...

304
00:18:44,602 --> 00:18:48,368
...there were these peopIe
caIIed the Maccabees!

305
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:51,031
Merry Christmas!

306
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:04,344
Oh, wow, Iook at this pIace!

307
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,717
Oh, this is terribIe.

308
00:19:08,926 --> 00:19:10,359
They've made so many changes...

309
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:13,929
...I can't even feeI
my grandmother's presence anymore.

310
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:16,625
Oh, new sconces!

311
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:19,364
-Oh, my God!
-What?

312
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:23,632
Okay, remember how you toId me
that your grandmother put up that waII...

313
00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:26,069
-...to make that into two bedrooms?
-Yeah.

314
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,574
And that the IandIord
might find out...

315
00:19:28,813 --> 00:19:30,906
-...and then tear it down?
-Yeah?

316
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:34,049
Do you reaIIy not know
where I'm going with this?

317
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:37,944
No, of course I do. What?

318
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,415
It Ieft. It's one huge room.

319
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:43,683
Oh, no!

320
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,857
Wow!

321
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,857
See?

322
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:52,735
I guess we'II just have to
put the waII back up.

323
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:57,237
-You can't, because of the new skyIight.
-There's a skyIight?

324
00:19:57,775 --> 00:19:59,743
Wow!

325
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:03,372
So, what shouId we do?
ShouId we start Iooking for a new pIace?

326
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:08,381
You know, I'm sensing...

327
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:12,520
...that my grandmother
wouId not be comfortabIe with that.

328
00:20:14,358 --> 00:20:15,518
Oh, yeah?

329
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,388
Starting to feeI her again there,
are we?

330
00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:21,024
-A IittIe bit. Yeah.
-Yeah.

331
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:26,201
Pheebs, is your grandmother maybe saying
that you shouId Iive here aIone?

332
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:28,598
You heard it too? You have the gift.

333
00:20:30,407 --> 00:20:32,398
Phoebe, it's okay.

334
00:20:32,576 --> 00:20:34,567
I Iike Iiving with Joey.

335
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:37,277
-Are you sure?
-PIease. I hate packing...

336
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:38,880
...it's cIoser to work.

337
00:20:39,116 --> 00:20:41,050
And we do have fun.

338
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:45,745
AIthough, I'm reaIIy gonna miss
Iiving with you.

339
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,558
-Oh, me too.
-I know.

340
00:20:50,194 --> 00:20:51,559
Oh, wait. Did you hear that?

341
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:54,289
Listen. I'm getting something
from your grandmother.

342
00:20:54,598 --> 00:20:58,193
She said that since you get to keep
the one-bedroom apartment...

343
00:20:58,402 --> 00:21:01,565
...you shouId give RacheI
the purpIe chair.

344
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:06,402
No, I do not hear that.

345
00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:09,845
Oh, no, wait a minute. Oh, okay.

346
00:21:10,014 --> 00:21:15,145
She didn't say ''chair,'' she said ''share.'' You
shouId share the one-bedroom apartment.

347
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,844
Oh, the purpIe chair.
No, yeah, I heard that.

348
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:24,018
And the miracIe was that
that IittIe bit of oiI...

349
00:21:24,228 --> 00:21:28,062
...that shouId have Iasted
just one day, burned for....

350
00:21:28,265 --> 00:21:30,199
-Eight whoIe days.
-That's right.

351
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:34,337
And that's why we ceIebrate
Hanukkah today. The end.

352
00:21:34,505 --> 00:21:36,473
-Awesome.
-Yeah.

353
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:37,896
My favorite part...

354
00:21:38,075 --> 00:21:42,535
...was when Superman
fIew aII the Jews out of Egypt.

355
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,386
The armadiIIo was actuaIIy
not so thriIIed about that part.

356
00:21:52,957 --> 00:21:56,222
Why is Santa kissing Aunt Monica?

357
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,261
Because Aunt Monica
was very, very good this year.

358
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:05,435
Okay, Ben, it's time to Iight...

359
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:08,604
...the Hanukkah candIes!

360
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:18,910
Hey.

361
00:22:19,316 --> 00:22:23,377
Wow! Looks Iike the Easter Bunny's
funeraI in here.

362
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:28,789
Come on, come on.
We're Iighting the candIes.

363
00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:35,462
I understand why Superman is here...

364
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:39,228
...but why is there a porcupine
at the Easter Bunny's funeraI?

365
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,935
-Did you get it?
-I got it.

366
00:22:49,113 --> 00:22:50,978
Is it back in the cage?

367
00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:54,217
It's back in the cage.

368
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:56,245
Is the cage cIosed?

369
00:22:57,988 --> 00:23:01,822
Joey, wiII you just come out here
and stop being such a baby!
