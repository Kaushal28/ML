1
00:00:02,648 --> 00:00:04,946
-l don't know.
-What?

2
00:00:05,117 --> 00:00:07,677
Well, as old as he is
in dog years...

3
00:00:07,853 --> 00:00:11,380
...do you think Snoopy should
still be allowed to fly this thing?

4
00:00:11,557 --> 00:00:13,752
-Rachel?
-Yeah?

5
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:17,828
You remember when you first came here,
how you spent two weeks getting trained?

6
00:00:17,996 --> 00:00:20,760
Sure. Do you need me
to train somebody new?

7
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:23,261
Good one.

8
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:29,600
Actually, Terry wants you to take
the training again. Whenever.

9
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:34,974
Do you believe that?

10
00:00:40,586 --> 00:00:41,610
Yeah.

11
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:46,049
The One Where Rachel Quits

12
00:01:30,802 --> 00:01:34,033
So that's two boxes
of the Holiday Macaroons.

13
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,936
On behalf of the Brown Birds of America,
l salute you.

14
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:43,640
Just admit it, Chandler.
You have no backhand.

15
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:46,682
Excuse me, little one.
l have a very solid backhand.

16
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:50,182
Shielding your face
and shrieking like a girl...

17
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:52,184
...is not a backhand.

18
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:55,352
l was shrieking...

19
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:56,855
...like a Marine.

20
00:01:59,097 --> 00:02:03,431
All right, here. Watch me execute
the three P's of championship play.

21
00:02:03,602 --> 00:02:04,796
Power.

22
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:06,728
Precision.

23
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:08,333
And panache.

24
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:14,945
You broke a little girl's leg?

25
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:17,847
l know. l feel horrible, okay?

26
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:22,043
lt says here that a Muppet got whacked
on Sesame Street last night.

27
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:26,251
Where exactly were you around 1 0-ish?

28
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:30,521
Well, l'm gonna go see her.
l wanna bring her something.

29
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:33,358
-What do you think she'd like?
-Maybe a Hello Kitty doll?

30
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:35,793
The ability to walk?

31
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:41,429
l'm gonna get back to re-training.

32
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,767
All right. See you guys.

33
00:02:43,942 --> 00:02:45,807
Look out, kids! He's coming!

34
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:50,948
And l gotta go sell
some Christmas trees.

35
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:53,774
Have fun.
Wait! No, don't!

36
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:57,216
l forgot. l am totally
against that now.

37
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,920
What? Me having a job?

38
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:05,462
No. No, l am against innocent trees
being cut down in their prime...

39
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:08,564
...and their corpses
grotesquely dressed...

40
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:11,395
...in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.

41
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,038
Hey, how do you sleep at night?

42
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:17,903
Well, l'm pretty tired
from lugging the trees around.

43
00:03:19,177 --> 00:03:22,613
Hey, Phoebe, listen.
You got this all wrong.

44
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:24,908
Those trees were born
to be Christmas trees.

45
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:29,144
They're fulfilling their life purpose
by making people happy.

46
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:30,513
Really?

47
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:34,592
Yes.

48
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,021
Yes, and the trees are happy too...

49
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:39,456
...because, for most of them,
it's their only...

50
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:41,426
...chance to see New York.

51
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,602
After you've delivered the drinks,
take the tray--

52
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:51,366
Gunther, please. l have worked here
for two and a half years.

53
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,272
l know the empty trays go over there.

54
00:03:54,513 --> 00:03:57,607
What if you put them here?

55
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:03,045
You know, that's actually a good idea.
They'll be closer to the mugs.

56
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:06,850
You know what? You should have
the other waitresses do that too.

57
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:09,289
They already do.

58
00:04:09,528 --> 00:04:11,996
That's why they call it the tray spot.

59
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:14,257
Jeez, l always heard them
talk about that.

60
00:04:14,432 --> 00:04:18,425
l sort of just thought it was, like,
a club they went to. Oh, God.

61
00:04:19,538 --> 00:04:21,972
-l'm sorry.
-lt's all right.

62
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,835
Sweetheart.

63
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,708
So this must be
kind of neat for you, huh?

64
00:04:31,983 --> 00:04:34,577
Your dad tells me you get
a couple of days off school...

65
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:37,950
...and you don't have to sell
those cookies anymore.

66
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:41,789
Well, l kind of wanted
to sell the cookies.

67
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,520
The girl who sells the most
wins a trip to Space Camp...

68
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:46,993
...and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.

69
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:51,602
Wow, you really like
all this space stuff, huh?

70
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:55,566
Yeah. My dad says if l spend as much
time helping him clean apartments...

71
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,174
...as l do daydreaming
about outer space...

72
00:04:58,343 --> 00:05:01,141
...he'd be able to afford
a trip to the Taj Mahal.

73
00:05:01,313 --> 00:05:05,545
l think you'd have to clean a whole lot
of apartments to go all the way to lndia.

74
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:08,880
No. The one in Atlantic City.
Dad loves the slots.

75
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:14,447
He says he's gonna double the
college money my grandma left me.

76
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:19,428
Well, good luck to Dad.

77
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:26,061
Say, how many more boxes would
you have to sell in order to win?

78
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:30,607
-The girl who won last year sold 475.
-Yeah?

79
00:05:30,775 --> 00:05:33,676
So far, l've sold 75.

80
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:38,680
Four hundred, huh?

81
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:42,375
Well, that sounds doable.
How much are the boxes?

82
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:43,714
Five dollars a box.

83
00:05:44,322 --> 00:05:46,654
And what is second prize?

84
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:51,520
A 1 0-speed bike. But l'd rather have
something my dad couldn't sell.

85
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,723
Well, that makes sense.

86
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:57,425
Could you do me one favor?

87
00:05:57,602 --> 00:06:00,366
-lf it's not too much trouble.
-Yeah, Sarah. Anything.

88
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:02,506
Could you pull the curtains open for me?

89
00:06:02,674 --> 00:06:05,472
The astronauts from the space
shuttle are gonna be on the news.

90
00:06:05,644 --> 00:06:08,112
Since we don't have a TV,
the lady across the alley...

91
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,772
...said she'd push hers up
to her window so l can watch it.

92
00:06:24,262 --> 00:06:25,456
Yes?

93
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,224
Yeah, hi. l'm selling
Brown Bird cookies.

94
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,996
You're no Brown Bird.
l can see you through my peephole.

95
00:06:34,272 --> 00:06:38,675
No. Hi. l'm an honorary Brown Bird.

96
00:06:41,546 --> 00:06:42,774
What does that mean?

97
00:06:43,014 --> 00:06:48,919
Well, it means that l can sell cookies,
but l'm not invited to sleepovers.

98
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:54,853
l can dial 91 1 at the press
of a button, you know.

99
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:56,288
Now, go away!

100
00:06:56,528 --> 00:06:59,326
Please, please.
lt's for a poor little girl...

101
00:06:59,564 --> 00:07:03,000
...who wants to go to Space Camp
more than anything in the world.

102
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:04,632
l'm pressing.

103
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:06,963
A policeman is on his way.

104
00:07:07,138 --> 00:07:09,698
Okay, okay.
l'm going, l'm going.

105
00:07:14,913 --> 00:07:16,403
l can still see you!

106
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:17,639
All right!

107
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:23,881
-Hey.
-Hey.

108
00:07:24,055 --> 00:07:25,181
What are you doing here?

109
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:27,917
Well, l thought
a lot about what you said...

110
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:31,654
...and l realize maybe
l was a little judgmental.

111
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:34,091
Yeah. But....

112
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:36,699
Now, Phoebe, remember, hey...

113
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:39,166
...they're just fulfilling
their Christmas--

114
00:07:39,337 --> 00:07:40,804
-Destiny. Yes.
-Sure.

115
00:07:42,007 --> 00:07:43,838
Okay.

116
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:47,167
Yikes. That one
doesn't look very fulfilled.

117
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:50,508
That's one of the old ones.
He's just taking it to the back.

118
00:07:50,715 --> 00:07:53,149
You keep the old ones in the back?

119
00:07:53,318 --> 00:07:55,650
That is so ageist.

120
00:07:56,688 --> 00:08:01,057
-We have to make room for the fresh ones.
-So, what happens to the old guys?

121
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:03,049
Well, they go into the chipper.

122
00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:07,522
Why do l have a feeling
that's not as happy as it sounds?

123
00:08:24,783 --> 00:08:27,343
These come in the shapes of your
favorite Christmas characters.

124
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,181
Santa, Rudolph and baby Jesus.

125
00:08:31,956 --> 00:08:34,754
All right. l'll take a box
of the cream-filled Jesuses.

126
00:08:36,027 --> 00:08:39,724
Wait a minute. One box? Come on. l'm
trying to send a little girl to Space Camp.

127
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:42,833
l'm putting you down for five boxes.
Chandler, what about you?

128
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:47,301
All right. Do you have any
coconut-flavored deities?

129
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:51,841
No, but there's coconut
in the Hanukkah Menorah-eos.

130
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,273
l'll tell you what. l'll put you down
for eight boxes. One for each night.

131
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:57,437
Mon?

132
00:08:57,615 --> 00:09:01,813
All right. l'll take one box of
the Mint Treasures. One, and that's it.

133
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:05,181
l started gaining weight after
l joined the Brown Birds. Remember?

134
00:09:05,356 --> 00:09:08,792
Dad bought every one
of my boxes, and l ate them all.

135
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:12,662
No, Mon. Dad had to buy
every one of your boxes...

136
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:14,890
...because you ate them all.

137
00:09:17,235 --> 00:09:21,968
But, you know, l'm sure that's
not gonna happen this time.

138
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,836
Why don't l put you down
for three of the Mint Treasures...

139
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:26,806
...and just a couple of the Rudolphs.

140
00:09:26,978 --> 00:09:28,536
No.

141
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:33,643
Come on, now.
You know you want them.

142
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:36,150
Don't. Don't do this.

143
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:40,951
l'll tell you what, Mon.
l'll give you the first box for free.

144
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,855
Oh, God! l gotta go!

145
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:47,327
Come on. All the cool kids
are eating them.

146
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,636
When you have a second, l want to show
you why we don't just trap spiders...

147
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:55,534
...under coffee mugs
and leave them there.

148
00:09:58,776 --> 00:10:03,213
l'm training to be better at a job
that l hate. My life officially sucks.

149
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:05,349
Wasn't this supposed
to be a temporary thing?

150
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:09,783
-l thought you wanted to do fashion stuff.
-Well, yeah. l'm still pursuing that.

151
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:12,789
How, exactly, are you pursuing that?

152
00:10:12,957 --> 00:10:17,053
You know, other than sending out
rêsumês, like, what? Two years ago?

153
00:10:17,795 --> 00:10:20,730
Well, l'm also sending out...

154
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:23,231
...good thoughts.

155
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:27,133
lf you ask me,
as long as you got this job...

156
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:29,865
...you got nothing pushing you
to get another one.

157
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,407
You need The Fear.

158
00:10:32,577 --> 00:10:34,272
-The Fear?
-He's right.

159
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:35,912
lf you quit this job, you then...

160
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,174
...have motivation to go after
a job you really want.

161
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,011
Why are you still at a job you hate?

162
00:10:41,186 --> 00:10:44,019
l mean, why don't you quit
and get The Fear?

163
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,624
Because l'm too afraid.

164
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:50,483
l don't know.

165
00:10:50,662 --> 00:10:55,122
l mean, l would give anything to work
for a designer, you know, or a buyer.

166
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,860
l just don't want to be 30
and still work here.

167
00:10:58,036 --> 00:11:02,939
Yeah, that'd be much worse than
being 28 and still working here.

168
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:05,007
-Rachel?
-Yeah?

169
00:11:05,176 --> 00:11:09,476
Remind me to review with you which
pot is decaf and which is regular.

170
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:13,306
Can't l just look at the handles on them?

171
00:11:13,484 --> 00:11:15,247
You would think.

172
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:19,880
Okay, fine. Gunther, you know what?
l am a terrible waitress.

173
00:11:20,124 --> 00:11:24,083
Do you know why l'm a terrible
waitress? Because l don't care.

174
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:27,859
l don't care. l don't care which pot
is regular and which pot is decaf.

175
00:11:28,032 --> 00:11:30,626
l don't care where the tray spot is.
l just don't care.

176
00:11:30,802 --> 00:11:33,293
This is not what l want to do.

177
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:37,532
So l don't think l should do it anymore.

178
00:11:38,676 --> 00:11:41,144
-l'm gonna give you my week's notice.
-What?

179
00:11:41,312 --> 00:11:43,280
Gunther, l quit.

180
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,276
Does this mean we're gonna
have to start paying for coffee?

181
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:55,591
Okay, 1 2.

182
00:11:56,427 --> 00:11:57,758
Twenty-two.

183
00:11:58,363 --> 00:11:59,591
Eighteen.

184
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:05,358
What?

185
00:12:05,536 --> 00:12:07,367
l spelled out ''boobies.''

186
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:15,845
Ross? Put me down for another box
of the Mint Treasures, okay?

187
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:18,539
Where are the Mint Treasures?

188
00:12:19,284 --> 00:12:21,275
We're out. l sold them all.

189
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:23,310
What?

190
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:25,888
Monica, l'm cutting you off.

191
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,324
No.

192
00:12:29,494 --> 00:12:31,223
No.

193
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:33,458
Just a couple more boxes.

194
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,858
lt's no big deal, all right? l'm cool.

195
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:42,401
You gotta help me out
with a couple more boxes!

196
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,975
Mon, look at yourself.
You have cookie on your neck.

197
00:12:46,477 --> 00:12:47,466
Oh, God!

198
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:53,573
-So how many you sold so far?
-Check this out.

199
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:58,051
-Five hundred and seventeen boxes.
-Oh, my God. How did you do that?

200
00:12:58,222 --> 00:13:00,520
Okay, the other night
l was leaving the museum...

201
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:04,890
...just as Laser Floyd was letting out
of the planetarium.

202
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:08,026
Without even trying, l sold 50 boxes.

203
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:11,861
That's when it occurred to me.
The key to my success: the munchies.

204
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:18,372
So l started hitting
the NYU dorms around midnight.

205
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,445
l am selling cookies by the case.

206
00:13:23,614 --> 00:13:27,243
They call me ''Cookie Dude.''

207
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:33,315
-Okay, but l'm not going to call you that.
-Okay.

208
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:38,028
Okay. Stop what you're doing. l need
envelope stuffers. l need stamp lickers....

209
00:13:38,196 --> 00:13:41,962
-Hey, who did these rêsumês for you?
-Me. On my computer.

210
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,065
You sure used a large font.

211
00:13:44,302 --> 00:13:46,770
Yeah. Well, ''Waitress
at a Coffeehouse'' ...

212
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:50,635
...and ''Cheer Squad Co-Captain''
only took up so much room.

213
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:53,742
Hey, that's funny!

214
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:56,607
You're funny, Chandler!
You're a funny guy!

215
00:13:56,814 --> 00:13:58,611
You know what else is really funny?

216
00:13:59,283 --> 00:14:01,808
Something else l might have said?

217
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:06,353
l don't know. l don't know. Weren't you
the guy that told me to quit my job...

218
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:09,789
...when l had absolutely
nothing else to do?

219
00:14:12,797 --> 00:14:16,392
-Sweetie, calm down. lt's gonna be okay.
-No, it's not gonna be okay, Ross.

220
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:20,503
Tomorrow is my last day,
and l don't have a lead.

221
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,162
Okay. You know what?
l'm just gonna call Gunther...

222
00:14:23,341 --> 00:14:25,070
...and tell him l'm not quitting.

223
00:14:25,243 --> 00:14:27,734
You don't want to give in to The Fear.

224
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:31,370
You and your stupid Fear.
l hate your Fear!

225
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:33,949
l would like to take
you and your Fear--

226
00:14:34,118 --> 00:14:36,484
Hey! l got great news.

227
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:39,452
Run, Joey. Run for your life!

228
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:44,652
What? Rach, listen. Have you ever
heard of Fortunata Fashions?

229
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:45,818
No.

230
00:14:45,997 --> 00:14:49,489
My old man's doing a plumbing job there,
and he heard they have an opening.

231
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,658
Want to see if he
can get you an interview?

232
00:14:51,836 --> 00:14:55,738
Oh, my God, yes. l would love that.
That's so sweet, Joey.

233
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,067
Not a problem.

234
00:14:57,241 --> 00:14:59,766
And now for the great news.

235
00:15:00,044 --> 00:15:01,705
What, that wasn't the great news?

236
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:03,710
Only if you think
it's better than this.

237
00:15:04,348 --> 00:15:06,373
Snow-in-a-Can!

238
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:09,952
l got it at work.
You want me to decorate the window?

239
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:11,985
Give it kind of a Christmas looky?

240
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,221
Christmas cookie?

241
00:15:19,397 --> 00:15:21,865
Okay, and this one here's
a Douglas fir.

242
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:25,662
Now, it's a little more money,
but you get a nicer smell.

243
00:15:26,504 --> 00:15:28,199
Looks good. l'll take it.

244
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:30,806
Wait, wait. No, no.
You don't want that one.

245
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:34,375
No. You can have
this cool brown one.

246
00:15:35,613 --> 00:15:37,979
lt's almost dead.

247
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:41,880
But that's why you have to buy it,
so that it can fulfill its Christmas destiny.

248
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:46,353
Otherwise, they're gonna throw
it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey.

249
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:50,255
Yeah, the trees that don't fulfill
their Christmas destiny...

250
00:15:50,428 --> 00:15:52,828
...are thrown in the chipper.

251
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:56,930
l think l'm gonna look around
a little bit more.

252
00:15:57,702 --> 00:16:01,729
Pheebs. You gotta stop doing this.
l'm working on commission here.

253
00:16:03,341 --> 00:16:05,605
Hey, guys. l'm here
to pick out my Christmas tree.

254
00:16:05,843 --> 00:16:09,711
Well, look no further.
This one's yours.

255
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:14,975
ls this the one
that l threw out last year?

256
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,116
All right. You know what? Never mind.
Everybody wants to have a green one.

257
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:24,660
Sorry. l'm sorry. l didn't mean
to get so emotional. l guess it's just....

258
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:26,387
The holidays are just hard.

259
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:30,295
Oh, honey. ls that because
your mom died around Christmas?

260
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:32,834
l wasn't even thinking about that.

261
00:16:42,346 --> 00:16:45,338
Hi, there.
How many did you sell?

262
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:50,385
l'm not gonna tell you. You're the
bad man who broke Sarah's leg.

263
00:16:51,522 --> 00:16:54,047
Hey, now. That was an accident, okay?

264
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:55,487
You're a big scrud.

265
00:16:57,628 --> 00:16:59,118
What's a scrud?

266
00:16:59,297 --> 00:17:01,424
Why don't you look
in the mirror, scrud.

267
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:07,029
l don't have to.
l can just look at you.

268
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:09,600
All right, girls...

269
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:12,173
...and man.

270
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:15,808
Let's see your final tallies.

271
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:18,611
Debbie.

272
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:22,643
Three hundred and twenty-one
boxes of cookies. Very nice.

273
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:25,588
Not nice enough.

274
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,187
Charla.

275
00:17:27,358 --> 00:17:29,326
Two hundred and seventy-eight.

276
00:17:29,594 --> 00:17:31,494
Sorry, dear, but still good.

277
00:17:31,662 --> 00:17:34,529
Good for a scrud.

278
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:38,734
Yes, Elizabeth.

279
00:17:39,737 --> 00:17:42,069
Eight hundred and seventy-one.

280
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:44,230
That's crap!

281
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:49,936
Sister Brown Bird.

282
00:17:50,181 --> 00:17:52,172
Good going.

283
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:56,683
Who's next?

284
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:03,319
-Hi, there.
-Hi.

285
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:06,021
And batting for Sarah...

286
00:18:06,864 --> 00:18:08,388
...Ross Geller.

287
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:12,768
Eight hundred and seventy-two.

288
00:18:13,671 --> 00:18:17,971
Although, it looks like you bought
an awful lot of cookies yourself.

289
00:18:18,142 --> 00:18:21,236
That is because my doctor
says that l have...

290
00:18:21,412 --> 00:18:24,813
...a very serious...

291
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:27,280
...nougat...

292
00:18:28,552 --> 00:18:30,986
...deficiency.

293
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:33,921
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.

294
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:40,425
Well, l lost. Some little girl loaned
her uniform to her 1 9-year-old sister...

295
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:45,592
...who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz
and sold over 2000 boxes.

296
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:50,668
-Hey, how'd the interview go?
-l blew it.

297
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:53,309
l wouldn't have even hired me.

298
00:18:53,844 --> 00:18:54,902
Come here, sweetie.

299
00:18:55,146 --> 00:18:56,272
Listen...

300
00:18:56,614 --> 00:19:01,847
...you're gonna go on, like, a thousand
interviews before you get a job.

301
00:19:05,656 --> 00:19:08,716
That's not how that
was supposed to come out.

302
00:19:08,893 --> 00:19:10,986
This is just the worst Christmas ever.

303
00:19:11,462 --> 00:19:14,659
You know what, Rach? Maybe you
should stay here at the coffeehouse.

304
00:19:14,832 --> 00:19:18,859
l can't. lt's too late. Terry already
hired that girl over there.

305
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:20,296
Look at her.

306
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:23,440
She's even got waitress experience.

307
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:25,601
Last night she was...

308
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,944
...teaching everybody
how to make...

309
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:29,476
...napkins...

310
00:19:29,714 --> 00:19:32,683
...into....

311
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:37,113
That word was ''swans.''

312
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:46,052
Well, seeing that drunk Santa wet
himself really perked up my Christmas.

313
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:55,598
Oh, my God!

314
00:19:56,173 --> 00:19:57,663
Merry Christmas!

315
00:19:59,143 --> 00:20:01,373
You saved them!
You guys!

316
00:20:01,645 --> 00:20:03,636
Oh, God, you're the best!

317
00:20:03,814 --> 00:20:06,476
lt's like Night of the
Living Dead Christmas Trees.

318
00:20:09,954 --> 00:20:11,649
Hello.

319
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:13,881
Yeah, this is she.

320
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:17,921
You're kidding. You're kidding.

321
00:20:18,496 --> 00:20:20,487
Thank you. l love you!

322
00:20:20,664 --> 00:20:22,962
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.

323
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:24,795
l got the job!

324
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:27,233
That's great.

325
00:20:27,638 --> 00:20:30,971
God bless us, everyone.

326
00:20:33,077 --> 00:20:37,173
Here we go. Serving
my last cup of coffee.

327
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:45,680
There you go.

328
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:47,584
Enjoy.

329
00:20:50,494 --> 00:20:53,361
-Should l tell her l ordered tea?
-No.

330
00:20:54,465 --> 00:20:55,796
Excuse me, everyone.

331
00:20:57,034 --> 00:20:59,298
This is my last night working here...

332
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,734
...and l just wanted to say...

333
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:04,773
...that l made some
really good friends here.

334
00:21:05,075 --> 00:21:07,771
And it's just time to move on.

335
00:21:12,016 --> 00:21:14,712
And no offense to everybody
who still works here...

336
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:18,321
...but you have no idea
how good it feels to say...

337
00:21:18,489 --> 00:21:21,049
...that as of this moment...

338
00:21:21,225 --> 00:21:26,094
...l will never have
to make coffee again.

339
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:29,061
Now, Mr. Kaplan Sr.
likes his coffee strong.

340
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:32,669
So you're gonna use
two bags instead of one.

341
00:21:32,837 --> 00:21:35,635
See. Now, pay attention,
because this part's tricky.

342
00:21:35,806 --> 00:21:40,573
See, some people use filters
just once....

343
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,680
l'm sorry you didn't get to go
to Space Camp...

344
00:21:50,855 --> 00:21:56,350
...and l'm hoping that maybe somehow
this may help make up for it. Okay?

345
00:21:56,527 --> 00:21:58,392
Presenting...

346
00:21:58,562 --> 00:22:02,293
...Sarah Tuddle's
Private Very Special Space Camp!

347
00:22:06,637 --> 00:22:08,764
Really, Mr. Geller,
you don't have to do this.

348
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:10,873
Come on, here we go.

349
00:22:11,575 --> 00:22:15,409
Stand by for mission countdown.

350
00:22:15,846 --> 00:22:16,972
Ten, ten....

351
00:22:17,147 --> 00:22:18,409
Nine, nine, nine....

352
00:22:18,616 --> 00:22:20,140
Eight, eight, eight....

353
00:22:21,585 --> 00:22:23,485
Okay, blast off.

354
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,821
l'm an alien. l'm an alien.

355
00:22:35,065 --> 00:22:36,054
Oh, no! An asteroid!

356
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:40,726
