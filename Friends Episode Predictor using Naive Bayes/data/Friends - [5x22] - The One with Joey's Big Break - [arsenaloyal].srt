1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,110
What's going on?

2
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,409
My eye is a little itchy.

3
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,280
Mine too. Yeah.

4
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,319
It's really red.
You should go see my eye doctor.

5
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,824
I'm not gonna see your ex-boyfriend.

6
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,691
That's all I hear.
Richard, Richard, Richard.

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,695
Since we've dated,
I've said his name twice.

8
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,800
Okay. So Richard, Richard.

9
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:42,172
It's not Richard.
It's this new guy. He's good.

10
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,002
I'm sorry. I'm not going
to an eye doctor.

11
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,305
-Oh, God. Here we go.
-What?

12
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:52,178
Anytime anything comes close
to touching her eye or anyone else's...

13
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,444
...she, like, freaks out. Watch.

14
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,319
Ross, come on!

15
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,117
I have a weird thing with my eye.
Can we not talk about it?

16
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:06,557
Hey, Rach. You know that great song?
"Me, Myself and Eye."

17
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,333
Monica! Come on!

18
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,402
All those in favor
of getting lunch, say, "eye."

19
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,071
Ross! Stop it!

20
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:16,173
How much did I love
The King and Eye?

21
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,365
Chandler!

22
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:18,533
Me too, me too!

23
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,975
Just stop it! That's enough!

24
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,541
-You okay there, man?
-Yeah. I got too excited.

25
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:31,422
The One with Joey's Big Break

26
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,330
I gotta go.
I'm taking Ben to the park.

27
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,631
-Give him a kiss for me.
-All right. Bye.

28
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,472
Later.

29
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,876
I'm so sorry you got caught
in the middle of that.

30
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:29,843
I didn't mean to be so out there,
but I am furious with him.

31
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,017
Calm down?

32
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,454
I'm trying.
Man, that guy can push my buttons!

33
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,291
Why are you so mad?

34
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,457
-I don't wanna talk about it.
-lt seems like

35
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,133
You wanna be on my list too?
Keep talking.

36
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,327
Has anyone seen my list, by the way?

37
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,796
No. What's it look like?

38
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,010
-A piece of paper and it says, "Ross."
-I see.

39
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,808
I just got off the phone with Estelle.
Guess what?

40
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,485
I got the lead!

41
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,648
You got the lead in a movie?
What's it about?

42
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:13,086
It's called Shutterspeed.
It's really cool.

43
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,386
I meet this girl in the subway
and we fall in love in, like, a day.

44
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:21,532
And then she disappears.
But I find out where she lives.

45
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:25,033
This old lady answers the door.
I say, "Where's Betsy?"

46
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:30,241
And she says, "Betsy's been dead
for 10 years."

47
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:33,901
Chilling!

48
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:37,742
The best part is, we're filming
in the desert outside of Vegas.

49
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,076
-You know what that means.
-I know.

50
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:44,086
Road trip! We can rent a car.
I have to be there by Tuesday.

51
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,115
Wait! My grandmother's dead.

52
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,057
We can talk about that too, Phoebe.

53
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,257
No, her cab.

54
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,597
She probably won't be using it.
Drive it to Las Vegas.

55
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,296
All right! Thanks!

56
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,407
What are we gonna do about my job?

57
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,802
Not go.

58
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,603
Great! Road trip, baby!

59
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,104
Is this okay?

60
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,750
Chandler, you don't have to ask
for my permission.

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,909
You can go.

62
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,823
Rach, we'll be late
for the eye doctor.

63
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,754
All right. Let's get this over with.

64
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,459
Look what I did.

65
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,235
I mean, look at this mess.

66
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,908
We're gonna probably have to
clean this up.

67
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,668
I mean, we're gonna have to reschedule!

68
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:44,943
If you thought that this mess
was gonna bother me, you are wrong!

69
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,015
All right, let's go, Blinky.

70
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,630
Hey, Joey. What's up?

71
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,334
I can't decide which route
to take to Vegas.

72
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,437
You've traveled a lot, right?

73
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,300
Yeah, I've been around.

74
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,841
Which route should I take?
The north or the south route?

75
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,640
If you take the north route,
there's a man with a beard of bees.

76
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,316
Great! Problem solved!

77
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:24,518
On the south route, there's a chicken
that plays tic-tac-toe.

78
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,017
Well, back to square one.

79
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,829
I know a way that you can decide.

80
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:35,296
I'll ask you a series of questions
and you answer as quickly as you can.

81
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,627
Yes!

82
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:37,961
Good. But wait.

83
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,164
Here we go. I want you to relax.

84
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,369
Take a deep breath.

85
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,737
Clear your mind.

86
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,243
-Peanut butter or egg whites?
-Peanut butter.

87
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,642
-Be a fireman or a swimmer?
-Swimmer.

88
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:55,411
-You'd sleep with Monica or Rachel?
-Monica.

89
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,721
I always thought it'd be Rachel.

90
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,553
-No thinking. Tie or ascot?
-Ascot.

91
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,228
-North or south route?
-North.

92
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,727
Bam! There you go! Huh?

93
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:10,391
That was incredible!
Beard of bees here I come!

94
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,197
This guy again.

95
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,206
Hey, what's up?

96
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,743
Not much. Wanna see a movie tonight?

97
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,347
What do you wanna see?

98
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,674
I don't know.

99
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,442
I know how to decide.
Show him your game.

100
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,177
No, thank you.

101
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,248
What's with her?

102
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,585
I don't know.
I know how we can decide.

103
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,922
I'm gonna ask you questions
and you answer real quick.

104
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,755
-Action or comedy?
-Action.

105
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,764
Who would you rather sleep with,
Monica or Rachel?

106
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,197
Dude, you are sick.

107
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:55,610
I'm sorry. I forgot you had
that whole Rachel thing.

108
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,216
Oh, my God. What does that thing do?

109
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,627
-An eye removal machine.
-I'm out of here.

110
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,455
I'm kidding.

111
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,324
Rachel, I'm Dr. Miller.

112
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,795
Monica said you were nervous.
Everything will be fine.

113
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,198
-So we're done.
-Almost, but first we gotta start.

114
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,599
This is a glaucoma test. Sit down.

115
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,941
Put your chin here.

116
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,875
Now, you'll feel a small puff of air
in each eye.

117
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,343
What?

118
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:35,112
A small puff of air.
Now, come on!

119
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,220
Here we go.

120
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,183
One, two, three.

121
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,196
I'm sorry. All right.

122
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,026
I'm gonna stay in here this time.

123
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,323
Ready?

124
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,504
-One, two
-I'm sorry.

125
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,299
You know what?
I'm gonna hold her head.

126
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,008
That's okay.

127
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,041
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,547
You're young.
You don't have glaucoma.

129
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,882
So it was very, very nice
to meet you, sir.

130
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,219
What are you?
Are you crazy?

131
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,188
You got a small, minor infection
in that left eye.

132
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:23,095
Take these drops for a week
and you'll be as good as new.

133
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,566
No, I don't put things in my eye.

134
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:30,505
We'll see you here in three months.
And I'll fit you for a glass eye.

135
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,337
Give me the damn drops!

136
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,542
Dr. Miller?

137
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,516
P-E-C-F-D.

138
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,520
Very good, Monica!

139
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,782
-You know where they are.
-I sure do.

140
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,461
And you don't get one.

141
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,604
You know, those eye drops
are a miracle.

142
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,636
My eye is 100 percent better.

143
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,138
-They're still in my coat.
-Damn!

144
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,036
You ready to go?

145
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:11,205
How cold will it be there?
Will all these sweater vests be enough?

146
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,612
-What?
-I love you.

147
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,922
I wish Ross was coming with us.
I'll miss him.

148
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,959
Thanks. I just got
that jerk out of my mind.

149
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,456
Is the movie putting us up
in a big hotel suite?

150
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,794
Not really.
It's an independent film.

151
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:33,096
We don't have a big budget.
I'll stay in your room.

152
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,968
Once you get paid,
you'll be springing for a suite.

153
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,235
They must be paying you a lot.

154
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:43,471
For every dollar Shutterspeed makes...

155
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,911
...one penny of it goes
right in Joey's pocket.

156
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,085
You don't get paid unless
it makes money?

157
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,782
Did you not hear the plot
of the movie?

158
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,759
"She's been dead for 10 years."

159
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,023
I'm gonna be a millionaire!

160
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,027
I wanted to say goodbye.

161
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:07,602
And to see if you guys would
place a little bet for me.

162
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,171
Twenty bucks on black 15.

163
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,934
-You got it!
-All right.

164
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,916
-You remember the number, right?
-Yeah, black 13.

165
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,178
-Black 15!
-You got it.

166
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,821
-All right. Bye-bye, now.
-Bye, you guys.

167
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,683
I'll say bye at the car.

168
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,155
Anyone wanna say bye to me
at the car?

169
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:34,493
I'll say goodbye to you at the car
if you don't mind the pus.

170
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:37,958
See you!

171
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:42,773
But wait a minute. The pus is good.
It means it's healing.

172
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,005
Hey, Phoebe. What you reading?

173
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,115
Hello?

174
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,789
Come on!

175
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,794
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

176
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,068
Phoebe, are you mad at me
or something?

177
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,862
If you are, please tell me
what it is I did.

178
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,803
-lf you don't know, I can't help you.
-I don't know.

179
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,875
Well, I can't help you.

180
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,642
Well, whatever it is,
I am very, very sorry. Okay?

181
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,046
Apology accepted.

182
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,549
So we're good?

183
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,690
I'll see you later, okay?

184
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:39,922
Bye, fat-ass.

185
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,599
All right!

186
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,833
Will you please tell me what it is
that made you so mad at me?

187
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,872
I don't know! I don't remember!

188
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,969
What do you mean, you can't remember?

189
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:57,946
I was so focused on being mad at you,
I forgot what it was I was mad about.

190
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,518
If you can't remember,
can't we just forget about this?

191
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,953
Oh, no. I am mad at you.
I know that much.

192
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:11,128
But I'm sorry about the fat-ass thing
because you have a sweet, little heinie.

193
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,671
I'm getting pretty tired.
You'll have to take over soon.

194
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:28,240
We've been driving for a half-hour.
You haven't looked at the road once.

195
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,982
Don't worry. It's out there.

196
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,350
Maybe I just need lunch.
You wanna eat?

197
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,579
My treat.

198
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,556
Isn't that Ross' money?

199
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,395
Ross' treat.
Where do you wanna eat?

200
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:46,756
I don't know.

201
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,694
I know how we can decide.

202
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,835
I'll ask you questions.

203
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,503
And then you have to answer real fast.

204
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:57,175
So clear your mind.
Clear it right out. Clear it out.

205
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,409
It's all clear except for this image
of a small, purple lamp.

206
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,106
Is that all right if that stays in there?

207
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,285
I don't see why not. I guess.

208
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:12,356
You have to answer with the first thing
that pops into your head, okay?

209
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,185
-Would you rather be too wet or too dry?
-Too dry.

210
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,550
-Do you believe in ghosts?
-No.

211
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,923
-Will this movie be my big break?
-No.

212
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,059
-What?
-Yes.

213
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,868
-Dude, you said, no.
-I also said, yes.

214
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,768
-This won't be my big break?
-No.

215
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,212
I don't believe this.

216
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:38,005
Look, I just don't want you to get
your hopes up too high.

217
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,209
What are you talking about?
I'm the lead in a movie!

218
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,584
They're not even paying you!
This doesn't sound like a real movie!

219
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,850
I don't know why you're dumping
all over my big break.

220
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,858
I don't think this is gonna be
your big break.

221
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,794
Are you on this trip
to make me feel like a loser?

222
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,898
-I'd rather be alone.
-You don't want me here?

223
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,468
Not if you're like this.

224
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,731
The next time you ask me
a question like that, I'll lie.

225
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,703
I don't want you on the trip.

226
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,435
Why don't you pull over.
I'll get out now.

227
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,203
Fine.

228
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,639
Get out.

229
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,648
You can't stop on a bridge.

230
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,718
-Get out!
-Fine!

231
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,158
Wait! Wait! There's no sidewalk!

232
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,828
Yeah. I'm gonna die here.

233
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,498
Are you mad at me
because my hair gel smells?

234
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,740
Because I said your handwriting
is childlike?

235
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,274
No. That made me feel precious.

236
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,114
Because he's always
correcting people's grammar?

237
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,512
"Whom, whom." Sometimes it's "who"!

238
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,952
Yeah? Sometimes it's:

239
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:57,053
Did you beat him at a board game?
He's such a baby when he loses.

240
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,525
Okay, I'm the baby.

241
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,423
Hey! Stop it!

242
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,195
What are you doing here?

243
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,836
Joey kicked me out of the car
on the bridge.

244
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,132
-Why?
-I don't know. He went crazy.

245
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:12,868
We played that game where you
ask questions and answer fast.

246
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:16,513
That game should not be played
without my supervision.

247
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,373
I don't know what made him mad.

248
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,519
All I said was that
this wouldn't be his big break...

249
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,949
...that it wouldn't do
anything for him...

250
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,886
...and that it didn't sound real.

251
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,890
Okay, he should've
pushed me off the bridge.

252
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,153
What's in the bag?

253
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,990
I figured you'd be mad at me...

254
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,065
...so I got gifts that I found
on the roadside.

255
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,059
-Who wants the one-legged teddy bear?
-I do!

256
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:52,439
-Not even close.
-I need help! I can't do this.

257
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:53,982
Come on. Let's do it.

258
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:58,145
Sit down.
All right, put your head back.

259
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,521
-Now open your eyes.
-Okay, they are.

260
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,864
-How many fingers am I holding up?
-Four.

261
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,328
I was thinking four.

262
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,627
-Really?
-Yes!

263
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,838
Why don't we start
with a practice one.

264
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,337
-No drops.
-Great!

265
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:21,309
On three. One, two, three.

266
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,645
My pillow's all wet!

267
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,840
Well, you said it was practice!

268
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,143
Why did you move?

269
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,717
I knew you were lying!

270
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,322
-Come here.
-What are you doing?

271
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,618
Stop it! Oh, my God!

272
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,693
I am going....

273
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:39,726
Turn it over!

274
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,899
I am going to get...

275
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,030
...get these drops in your eye.

276
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,502
Oh, my God! You really are
freakishly strong.

277
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,399
Stop! Stop!

278
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,144
Stop it!

279
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,140
Damn, it's empty!

280
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:00,481
If Joey and Chandler walked in now,
we could make a fortune.

281
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,385
That is definitely Chandler,
Joey or Ross.

282
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,018
Or Rachel.

283
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,866
It's Joey.

284
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,733
Chandler told me what happened.
He's really upset.

285
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:26,769
Not as upset as he'll be when he finds
out what I did with his sweater vests.

286
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,246
What did you do to them?

287
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,111
There's a well-dressed
pack of dogs in Ohio.

288
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,391
I gotta ask Phoebe
something about the car.

289
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,058
Hold on one second.

290
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,785
-Hey, dude.
-Hey, Phoebe.

291
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,055
This wooden box keeps sliding out.
What is it?

292
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,290
My grandma.

293
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,637
And thanks.
She's having a great time.

294
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,641
Is that Joey? Let me talk to him.

295
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,539
Chandler's here.
He was wondering if

296
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,648
I guess he ran out of change.

297
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:10,287
How am I gonna apologize to him
if he won't even talk to me?

298
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:14,619
Send him something. So when he
gets there, he'll know you're sorry.

299
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:19,230
That's a good idea. I wonder where
I could get a basket of porn?

300
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,896
No, don't say, "I'm sorry," with porn.

301
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,570
You should send him
a carton of cigarettes.

302
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,899
Because that way he can trade it
for protection.

303
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,404
No. That's prison.

304
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,780
I know how we're gonna
figure this out.

305
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,244
Clear your mind...

306
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,943
...and answer the first thing
that comes into your head.

307
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,686
-Do you like flora or fauna?
-Fauna.

308
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,449
-Simon or Garfunkel?
-Garfunkel.

309
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,285
-Why are you mad?
-You said I was boring.

310
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,789
When did I say that?

311
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:59,094
Oh, my God! I remember now!
We were playing chess.

312
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,273
Phoebe, you and l
have never played chess.

313
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:07,639
Remember that time on the frozen lake?
We were playing. You said I was boring.

314
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:11,782
Then you took off your energy mask
and you were Cameron Diaz.

315
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,355
There's a chance this
may have been a dream.

316
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:26,922
So this entire time, you've been
angry with me because of a dream?

317
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,327
Well, guess what, now I'm mad at you.

318
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,533
I wanted to make sure this wasn't a dream.

319
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,538
Otherwise we're wasting our time.

320
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,401
Stanley!

321
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,535
Your leading man is here.
Let's get to work.

322
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,478
Slight change of plans.

323
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,146
We've shut down.

324
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,344
What? Why?

325
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,041
It's a money thing.
We don't have any.

326
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,245
You're kidding, right?

327
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,080
What?

328
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,654
It's probably just temporary.

329
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:33,227
We're hoping to get some money soon.
Just hang out.

330
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,399
Hang out? How long?

331
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:39,297
I don't know. A week. Maybe two.
The money will turn up.

332
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,940
People always wanna invest in movies.
You're not rich?

333
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,933
Worth a shot.

334
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,077
Well, Joey, let me know
where you're staying, okay?

335
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,313
Hey, pal. Are you Joey Tribbiani?

336
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,020
These got left for you.

337
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,848
Thanks.

338
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:03,616
"Congratulations on your big break."

339
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,654
-Monica, it's Joey.
-Hey, Joey.

340
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,297
You remember me
even though you're a star.

341
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,799
Come on. It'll be years
before I forget you.

342
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,606
What's it like on a movie set?

343
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,934
Do you have a dressing room
and a chair with your name?

344
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,805
Yeah, yeah, I got all that going on.

345
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,948
Tell Chandler he couldn't
have been more wrong.

346
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:01,584
I gotta go, Monica. My sushi's here.

347
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,154
Sorry about that.
Thanks for waiting.

348
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:10,659
Everybody smile.

349
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:17,968
Thanks a lot. Enjoy your stay
at Caesars. We hope it's toga-rific.

350
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,139
Kill me. Kill me now.

351
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,873
Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?

352
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,476
Go!

353
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,277
What are you doing?
Get off! Oh, my God!

354
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,114
Hold it open. Okay.

355
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,286
We'll see you in about
three or four hours.
