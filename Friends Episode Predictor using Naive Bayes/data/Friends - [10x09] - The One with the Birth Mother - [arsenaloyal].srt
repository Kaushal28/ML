1
00:00:02,214 --> 00:00:04,978
Hey, Emma, you better
appreciate this while it lasts...

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,143
...because when you get older, you're not
gonna be able to just sit around all day.

3
00:00:09,988 --> 00:00:12,081
- So true.
- Yeah.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,094
- Hey.
- Hey.

5
00:00:17,696 --> 00:00:19,926
We're here to say goodbye.
We're off to Ohio.

6
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:22,362
Oh, right, your adoption interview.

7
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:25,367
Yep. We'll meet the lady
who could be carrying our baby.

8
00:00:25,537 --> 00:00:29,701
I can't believe it. When you come back,
you'll have a baby. That is so weird.

9
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,775
And so incorrect.

10
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:34,306
She's only a couple months pregnant.

11
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,879
She liked our application
but might not like us.

12
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:39,040
Come on, she's gonna love you guys.

13
00:00:39,217 --> 00:00:41,947
Thank you. But we're trying
not to get our hopes up.

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,747
A lot could still get in our way.

15
00:00:43,922 --> 00:00:46,982
She could decide against adoption,
like another couple better.

16
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,626
What are you gonna name it?

17
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:52,897
I could develop a condition in which
I talk and talk and no one hears a word.

18
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:57,127
But just think, okay?
What if everything goes right?

19
00:00:57,302 --> 00:00:59,566
What if this woman does pick you guys?

20
00:01:00,772 --> 00:01:03,935
Oh, my God. She's gonna pick us!

21
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:06,737
So we're standing firm on
"not getting our hopes up"?

22
00:01:07,512 --> 00:01:10,345
No. I know things could still
go wrong, but if they don't...

23
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:13,450
...if this works out,
we're gonna have a baby. A baby!

24
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,553
- Yes. But--
- Oh, my God. It's gonna work!

25
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:17,279
We're gonna make it work!

26
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:19,822
I'm gonna be a mommy,
and you're gonna be a daddy!

27
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:22,859
All right, I'll see you suckers.
I'm gonna go get me a baby!

28
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:29,693
Screw it. I'm gonna be a daddy!

29
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:21,516
Hey, who's Phoebe with?

30
00:02:22,554 --> 00:02:24,181
Mike.

31
00:02:28,093 --> 00:02:32,052
No, Joey.
Who is Phoebe with at the door?

32
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:36,757
I wanna say, "Someone
I'm gonna have sex with."

33
00:02:39,738 --> 00:02:41,569
- Hey.
- Hey.

34
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,971
- So who's your friend?
- Oh, that's Sarah.

35
00:02:45,477 --> 00:02:47,206
No. Don't you get any ideas.

36
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:49,904
I'm not setting you up
with any more of my friends.

37
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:52,607
- Why? Why?
- Because you'll date her once...

38
00:02:52,784 --> 00:02:54,775
...sleep with her, then forget she exists.

39
00:02:54,953 --> 00:02:57,148
Name one friend of yours I did that with.

40
00:02:57,322 --> 00:02:59,654
- Mandy.
- Mandy, huh?

41
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:02,422
Really hot blond, big boobs?

42
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:07,462
- No.
- Might be why I don't remember, huh?

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,900
Do you think I'm someone else?

44
00:03:15,574 --> 00:03:18,634
Look, I may not have treated
your friends well in the past.

45
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,745
But I have grown up a lot.
Really. Honest. Rach?

46
00:03:21,913 --> 00:03:23,881
Yeah, believe it or not, it's true.

47
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:25,983
I mean, when Joey
and I were together...

48
00:03:26,151 --> 00:03:30,349
...he was wonderful.
He was thoughtful and mature.

49
00:03:30,522 --> 00:03:33,514
And for the one week
that we went out...

50
00:03:34,326 --> 00:03:36,089
...he didn't sleep with anybody else.

51
00:03:36,261 --> 00:03:38,354
Growth.

52
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:43,467
- Fine, I'll give you her number.
- Okay. Thank you.

53
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:45,660
And I promise you
I will not forget this one.

54
00:03:45,837 --> 00:03:47,270
- Mandy.
- Sarah!

55
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,236
Sarah.

56
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,941
- Hey.
- Hi.

57
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:55,443
- Hey.
- Hey, guys, I need some fashion advice.

58
00:03:57,282 --> 00:03:59,113
How does this look?

59
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:07,217
Well, it's-- It's a little low.
Pick it up a little.

60
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:10,417
A little bit more.

61
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:11,994
A little bit more.

62
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:13,597
There you go.

63
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:17,128
Now throw it away.

64
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:20,031
Come on! This looks good.

65
00:04:20,205 --> 00:04:23,641
Ross, please trust me.
I buy 30 fashion magazines a month.

66
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:27,301
Now I don't know who's running
for president or who that NATO guy is...

67
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,505
...but I do know that you
have to get far away from that hat.

68
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:32,248
Damn it. God....

69
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:35,682
I have this date tomorrow night,
and I have to look cool.

70
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:37,822
- Well, who's the girl?
- Her name's Joan.

71
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:40,514
She's in fashion.
She works for Hugo Boss.

72
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:44,059
Hugo Boss? I thought
you said she was in fashion.

73
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:49,264
At the Ralph Lauren offices,
that would've killed.

74
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:53,302
If you want fashion help, Rachel and l
are going shopping tomorrow.

75
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:56,599
- You're welcome to come with us.
- Really? That would be great.

76
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:58,265
I mean, I have to do something.

77
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:00,502
She kind of teased me
about how I dress.

78
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,271
I can see why. Nice shirt.

79
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:05,608
You're wearing the same shirt.

80
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:10,580
Stupid Gap on every corner!

81
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:21,628
Make yourselves comfortable,
and I'll be back with Erica.

82
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,597
Okay, thank you.

83
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:27,467
Well, this is it.

84
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,937
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just weird, you know?

85
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:34,807
It's like, "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have
the human growing inside you?"

86
00:05:36,781 --> 00:05:38,112
You're gonna be great.

87
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,008
You're gonna be great.

88
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:42,813
Well, obviously.

89
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:46,789
Monica? Chandler?
I'd like you to meet Erica.

90
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,449
- Hi.
- Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.

91
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:51,653
- Hi.
- Thank you for agreeing to see us.

92
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,559
- Hi.
- I'll let you get acquainted.

93
00:05:53,732 --> 00:05:56,792
- Okay.
- So it's Monica and Chandler?

94
00:05:56,968 --> 00:06:01,234
I only know you as
"File CRW3381 5-D."

95
00:06:01,806 --> 00:06:04,331
That's what our friends call us.

96
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:09,207
Gosh, you know, you're just
such an amazing couple. It's...

97
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:10,780
...kind of intimidating.

98
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:12,814
I don't know about that.

99
00:06:12,984 --> 00:06:15,976
Are you kidding me? I mean,
it's enough that you're a doctor.

100
00:06:17,422 --> 00:06:19,617
But on top of it,
you're married to a reverend?

101
00:06:24,896 --> 00:06:28,093
- I don't think that's exactly--
- Let her finish, doctor.

102
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,235
- Hey.
- Hey.

103
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:37,307
My friend Sarah
had a great time last night.

104
00:06:37,475 --> 00:06:39,875
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so you gonna call this one back?

105
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:41,808
No.

106
00:06:42,747 --> 00:06:44,738
What are you talking about?
Sarah's great.

107
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,613
Oh, really? You want to know
what your "great" friend did?

108
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:50,477
We're out to dinner, okay?

109
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:53,146
We were getting along,
having a really nice time.

110
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:55,225
I was thinking she was really cool.

111
00:06:55,393 --> 00:06:57,918
And then, out of nowhere....

112
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,286
That's it?

113
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:24,820
That's why you won't
go out with her again?

114
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,685
So she took some fries. Big deal.

115
00:07:26,858 --> 00:07:29,156
Hey, look, it's not about a few fries.

116
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:31,227
It's about what the fries represent.

117
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:33,830
- What?
- All food!

118
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,128
Well, I'm sorry.

119
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:39,566
I can't believe I set you up
with such a monster!

120
00:07:39,738 --> 00:07:41,831
Hey, look, I take a girl out...

121
00:07:42,007 --> 00:07:45,272
...she can order whatever she wants.
The more the better, all right?

122
00:07:45,443 --> 00:07:49,470
Just don't order a garden salad
and then eat my food!

123
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:52,249
That's a good way to lose some fingers.

124
00:07:54,652 --> 00:07:57,018
- Thank God you're here. Listen to this.
- What?

125
00:07:57,188 --> 00:08:00,851
Joey and my friend are out last night,
having dinner, and she reaches over...

126
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:03,995
- ...and takes a few of his fries--
- Oh, no!

127
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:06,255
What?

128
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:09,626
You know about the plate thing?

129
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:12,325
Oh, yeah, yeah. No,
Joey doesn't share food.

130
00:08:12,504 --> 00:08:15,234
I mean, just last week
we were having breakfast...

131
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,465
...and he had a couple grapes
on his plate.

132
00:08:17,642 --> 00:08:19,906
- You wouldn't let her have a grape?
- No, not me.

133
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:21,443
Emma.

134
00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:27,013
Joey doesn't share food!

135
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:34,825
Well, I still think that is a stupid reason
not to call someone again.

136
00:08:34,993 --> 00:08:37,257
You are calling her, okay?

137
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,990
And if you need to, then just
get an extra plate of fries for the table.

138
00:08:45,737 --> 00:08:47,398
I like that.

139
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:49,938
A sharing buffer. Yeah.

140
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:53,600
Yeah, I'll order some extra fries.
Maybe a plate of onion rings.

141
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:55,502
Yeah. Yeah.

142
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,012
And a shrimp cocktail.

143
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,414
And some Buffalo wings.

144
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:03,611
Maybe....
Maybe an individual pizza, huh?

145
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:06,279
And some mozzarella sticks.

146
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:09,322
What were we talking about?

147
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:18,461
Wow, this place is awesome.
Everyone is so mean.

148
00:09:23,174 --> 00:09:24,937
So fun.

149
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:28,171
We should just go.
I'm not gonna find anything here.

150
00:09:28,346 --> 00:09:29,677
This stuff is ridiculous.

151
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:32,476
Oh, this place is great!

152
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:38,855
Okay, you guys have fun.
I'm gonna go talk to people in this voice.

153
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:43,258
Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear
any of this. Nothing silver.

154
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:46,454
- Why?
- Okay, nothing with hair.

155
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:49,259
And nothing with padlocks on it!

156
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:52,403
Ross, look. Look, I know that some
of this stuff is out there.

157
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,266
But I mean, come on, look at this.
Look at this sweater.

158
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,374
I mean, this is just beautiful.

159
00:09:57,542 --> 00:09:59,703
Wow, this is really soft.

160
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:02,409
Three hundred and fifty dollars?

161
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,846
Down from 700.
You're saving, like, 200 bucks.

162
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,852
Both logic and math are taking
a serious hit today.

163
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,526
Hey, check this out. It's totally you.

164
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:18,059
- Wow.
- Yeah.

165
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:24,633
Wow. Actually, this looks pretty good.

166
00:10:24,802 --> 00:10:26,167
Yeah.

167
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:31,498
"Boys will be boys"?

168
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:34,839
- What? They will be!
- All right.

169
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:38,176
- That's it, I'm getting out of here.
- No, Ross, wait, come on.

170
00:10:38,349 --> 00:10:42,410
There's other stuff here. There's some
nice shirts, these nice pants.

171
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:44,714
Actually, these might look
pretty good on me.

172
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:47,722
Yes, they will. You know what you
should do? Go take a walk.

173
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:51,623
All right? I know your size, and I'll
pick out some really good stuff for you.

174
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:53,161
- Really?
- Yes.

175
00:10:53,331 --> 00:10:54,889
I know what looks sexy on guys.

176
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:58,194
Just wear what I suggest,
and she is gonna go nuts for you.

177
00:10:58,369 --> 00:10:59,734
So you're saying...

178
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:04,068
...if I wear these pants,
I might be getting into hers?

179
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,504
Why do men keep talking to me like this?

180
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:13,714
So the fact that I'm a doctor
and my wife's a reverend...

181
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:15,352
...that's important to you?

182
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,454
Yeah. I read some great applications...

183
00:11:17,622 --> 00:11:20,682
...but I thought, "Who better
than a minister to raise a child?"

184
00:11:20,858 --> 00:11:22,416
Amen.

185
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:27,787
Plus, I thought the baby would be
in good hands with a doctor.

186
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:29,524
Good hands.

187
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:31,760
Healing hands.

188
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:36,304
Reverend, can I ask? Does the Bible
say anything about adoption?

189
00:11:36,474 --> 00:11:38,442
It says, "Do it."

190
00:11:40,144 --> 00:11:44,979
"And behold, she did adopt
unto them a baby.

191
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:49,143
And it was good."

192
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:53,787
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

193
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:57,060
I was wondering--
You both have such serious jobs.

194
00:11:57,228 --> 00:12:00,322
Would you have time to take care
of a baby and your flock?

195
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:02,523
- My flock?
- People in your church.

196
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:05,299
Oh, my flock.

197
00:12:06,738 --> 00:12:08,968
Oh, no, my flock? My flock is good.

198
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,405
Yeah. My flock pretty much
takes care of themselves by this point.

199
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,840
Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.

200
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:19,677
But being a doctor,
that must take up a lot of time.

201
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:22,581
Not for me it doesn't.

202
00:12:22,754 --> 00:12:24,847
So how's everything going in here?

203
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:27,651
We're great. I think
I may have asked all my questions.

204
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:29,690
Good. Do you have questions for Erica?

205
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:33,592
Yeah, actually. So you read
a file that you liked...

206
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:37,394
...and then you gave the agency
the serial number and they contacted us?

207
00:12:37,568 --> 00:12:39,866
Yes. Our system ensures
total anonymity.

208
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:43,064
- We're very proud of it.
- You should be.

209
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,609
You're really on top of stuff.

210
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:50,441
Well then, if there's nothing else,
then the two of us should talk.

211
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:52,172
I actually....

212
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,614
- I don't think we have to.
- We don't?

213
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:58,051
Yeah, when I read about you two,
I was pretty sure I wanted you...

214
00:12:58,222 --> 00:13:00,850
...but I just thought
we should meet face to face.

215
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:03,220
I've made my decision.

216
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:05,291
I choose them.

217
00:13:05,763 --> 00:13:07,754
Oh, my God, this is great.

218
00:13:07,932 --> 00:13:09,797
This is so great. Did you hear that?

219
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:11,594
Yeah, I did.

220
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:13,293
Hey.

221
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:16,963
Thank you. Thank you so much.

222
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:20,506
You are so going to heaven!

223
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,951
- We got some really great stuff.
- Yeah.

224
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,611
Yeah, but I'm not sure
about some of the bras I got.

225
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:34,417
Really? Do you want to try
some of them on for me?

226
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:35,923
Okay.

227
00:13:36,094 --> 00:13:38,824
Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?

228
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:44,424
Oh, no. I took one of Ross' bags
by mistake.

229
00:13:44,602 --> 00:13:46,467
And one of mine is missing.

230
00:13:46,637 --> 00:13:49,003
Ross probably has it.
You'll get it from him later.

231
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,076
So, what do you think?

232
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:03,550
I think we're not wearing
the same shirt anymore.

233
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:06,753
Yeah. Yeah, Rachel picked it out for me.

234
00:14:06,924 --> 00:14:09,757
She told me to trust her,
and you know what? I'm glad I did.

235
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:12,589
I turned quite a few heads
on my way over here.

236
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,768
Dude, I really don't think
you should be wearing that.

237
00:14:18,302 --> 00:14:19,792
I see.

238
00:14:19,971 --> 00:14:24,271
Somebody's afraid of a little
competition with the ladies?

239
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:27,878
Looks like someone is the ladies!

240
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:31,471
You're just jealous because
you couldn't pull this off.

241
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:35,415
Yeah. Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a date.

242
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:41,817
See? All eyes on me!

243
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:49,591
- We are not signing those papers.
- Why not?

244
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:53,428
It's wrong. They made a mistake.
They think we're somebody else.

245
00:14:53,604 --> 00:14:56,129
God works in mysterious ways.

246
00:14:56,974 --> 00:14:59,067
You have got to stop.

247
00:14:59,544 --> 00:15:01,136
But she liked us.

248
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:04,145
She likes Doctor Chandler
and Reverend Monica.

249
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:08,048
If you think about it,
I'm kind of like a reverend.

250
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:14,715
I mean, as a chef, I serve God
by feeding the hungry and poor.

251
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:18,621
Your veal chop is 34.95!

252
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:22,661
Come on, I just-- I think
we've been given an opportunity.

253
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:25,826
The mistake's already made.
They're writing up the papers now.

254
00:15:26,003 --> 00:15:27,868
But we're not the ones she chose.

255
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:30,200
How can you feel okay about this?

256
00:15:31,742 --> 00:15:33,607
Because.

257
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:37,077
We may not be who she thinks we are...

258
00:15:37,248 --> 00:15:40,081
...but no one will ever
love that baby more than us.

259
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:41,775
- I know.
- I mean, who knows...

260
00:15:41,953 --> 00:15:44,945
...how long it's gonna take
for someone else to give us a baby?

261
00:15:45,122 --> 00:15:47,716
What if no one ever picks us?

262
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:49,553
Oh, honey....

263
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:51,285
Please?

264
00:15:51,462 --> 00:15:53,953
Please. We are so close.

265
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,233
Monica, I want a baby too.

266
00:15:58,402 --> 00:16:00,666
But this woman is giving away her child.

267
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:03,773
She deserves to know who it's going to.

268
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:13,109
Okay. You're right.

269
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:17,453
So we'll tell the truth.

270
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:21,114
And who knows, you know?
Maybe she'll like us for us.

271
00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:25,626
Maybe she will.

272
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,398
Why couldn't I have been a reverend?

273
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:30,830
You're Jewish.

274
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:34,398
Technicality!

275
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,439
Garden salad for the lady.

276
00:16:41,612 --> 00:16:44,911
Oh, that looks great. Good ordering.

277
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:48,950
Seafood platter for the gentleman,
and extra fries.

278
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,815
Enjoy.

279
00:16:53,224 --> 00:16:54,851
Those fries look delicious.

280
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:57,290
I didn't know you liked French fries.

281
00:16:57,461 --> 00:17:00,328
Help yourself. What's mine is yours.

282
00:17:04,835 --> 00:17:06,735
Wow, are those stuffed clams?

283
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:13,841
Yes, they are my stuffed clams.

284
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:19,216
How about those fries, though, huh?

285
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:23,011
- They are delicious.
- Yeah.

286
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:29,383
You are beautiful, you know that?

287
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:32,461
That is so sweet.

288
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:36,429
Okay, then.

289
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:50,005
Now look what you did!

290
00:17:50,181 --> 00:17:52,376
What? What is the matter with you?

291
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,950
I don't like it when people
take food off of my plate, okay?

292
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,111
But you said, "What's mine is yours."

293
00:17:58,289 --> 00:17:59,984
Well, I didn't mean it!

294
00:18:01,325 --> 00:18:05,694
Fine. Sorry, I didn't think
it was that big a deal.

295
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:09,232
No, I'm sorry. I....

296
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,860
I'm overreacting, okay?
It's just, when it comes to food, l...

297
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:15,596
...have certain rules...

298
00:18:15,773 --> 00:18:17,570
...okay? I mean...

299
00:18:17,742 --> 00:18:22,702
...there are things you do, and,
you know, things that you don't do.

300
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:31,281
Wow, this place looks great.

301
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:35,949
Oh, you are gonna love it.
And I'm so glad we're finally doing this.

302
00:18:36,127 --> 00:18:39,153
- Me too.
- Here.

303
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:50,039
So this was fun.

304
00:18:58,082 --> 00:19:01,017
I really am sorry about,
you know, before.

305
00:19:01,185 --> 00:19:03,881
And I want to make sure you
know I really do like you.

306
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:06,819
Sure, just not as much as clams.

307
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:08,754
Well, stuffed clams....

308
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:12,661
Chocolate torte for the lady.

309
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,991
Cheesecake for the gentleman.

310
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:19,933
Excuse me, sir. There seems to be some
sort of red crap on my cheesecake.

311
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:23,469
Yes, that's a raspberry coulis.

312
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:25,438
Coulis is not a monkey?

313
00:19:26,844 --> 00:19:30,871
When I read the description I thought
it came with a little raspberry monkey.

314
00:19:31,248 --> 00:19:35,275
- Oh, my God.
- I'll just have what she's having instead.

315
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:38,286
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
That was our last piece.

316
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:48,592
I'm so stupid ordering cheesecake,
trying to be healthy.

317
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:52,864
Oh, no.

318
00:19:53,037 --> 00:19:55,767
This is work. I should call in.
Can you excuse me?

319
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,170
Yeah, sure. No problem.

320
00:20:00,478 --> 00:20:03,641
What are you doing?
I thought you don't share food?

321
00:20:03,814 --> 00:20:05,372
Sure I do.

322
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:07,517
Coulis?

323
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:11,519
No. If I can't have your clams,
you can't have my dessert.

324
00:20:11,689 --> 00:20:13,316
This is a two-way street.

325
00:20:16,026 --> 00:20:17,755
Really?

326
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:19,760
Really.

327
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,660
Now this all better be here
when I come back.

328
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:26,564
Yeah, of course. I can control myself.

329
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:41,215
Stop staring at me!

330
00:20:51,962 --> 00:20:55,420
Just a tiny little....

331
00:21:09,113 --> 00:21:11,707
I'm not even sorry.

332
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:17,587
- Hi.
- Hey.

333
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:21,885
So these are the preliminary forms
for an open adoption.

334
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:24,960
There's a lot to go over,
but I'll explain as we go through.

335
00:21:26,997 --> 00:21:29,227
- Is that a picture?
- Yeah.

336
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,834
It's a sonogram they took
of the baby last week.

337
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:33,697
I thought you might want to see it.

338
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:43,236
Look, doctor.

339
00:21:47,284 --> 00:21:50,549
Look, before we sign anything,
we really have to talk.

340
00:21:54,024 --> 00:21:55,958
We're not who you think we are.

341
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:59,220
- I don't understand.
- The agency must have made a mistake.

342
00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:02,365
My wife is not a reverend,
and I'm not a doctor.

343
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:04,467
- What?
- That's impossible.

344
00:22:04,635 --> 00:22:08,002
I could perform an operation on you
and prove it if you'd like.

345
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,868
I have to check your file. Excuse me.

346
00:22:13,043 --> 00:22:14,408
So who are you?

347
00:22:14,578 --> 00:22:17,638
Our names really are Monica and
Chandler. We're from New York.

348
00:22:17,815 --> 00:22:20,215
Yeah, but the important thing
to know about us...

349
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:23,581
...is how much we would care
for this little baby.

350
00:22:23,754 --> 00:22:25,745
So you lied to me before?

351
00:22:25,923 --> 00:22:29,518
Well, we "bore false witness."

352
00:22:30,961 --> 00:22:33,452
See? I could be a reverend.

353
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:36,023
I can't believe this.

354
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,691
But we were hoping that
since we told you the truth...

355
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:41,997
- ...that you still might consider--
- Giving you my baby?

356
00:22:42,172 --> 00:22:44,333
You think I'd give you
my child after this?

357
00:22:44,508 --> 00:22:47,136
You don't have to decide now.
If you look at our file--

358
00:22:47,311 --> 00:22:50,371
I don't want to look at your file.
This is over.

359
00:22:54,818 --> 00:22:56,547
Erica, wait.

360
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,688
I have nothing to say to you.

361
00:22:58,856 --> 00:23:01,017
Look, you have every reason to be upset.

362
00:23:01,191 --> 00:23:02,658
We did lie.

363
00:23:02,826 --> 00:23:06,853
But only because we've been waiting
and trying to have a baby for so long.

364
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:10,523
And we don't know how long it's gonna
be before we get another chance.

365
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:12,828
Why don't you ask the reverend
to pray on it?

366
00:23:13,003 --> 00:23:15,938
Erica, please.

367
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:20,236
Just consider us.
Ask them to see our file.

368
00:23:20,411 --> 00:23:22,379
Our last name's Bing.

369
00:23:22,546 --> 00:23:25,140
My wife's a chef, and I'm in advertising.

370
00:23:26,216 --> 00:23:28,047
Oh, yeah.

371
00:23:28,218 --> 00:23:30,743
I actually liked you guys.

372
00:23:32,222 --> 00:23:34,486
But it doesn't matter.
What you did was wrong.

373
00:23:34,658 --> 00:23:37,126
But you did like us.

374
00:23:37,328 --> 00:23:39,319
And you should.

375
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,060
My wife's an incredible woman.

376
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:46,259
She is loving, and devoted and caring.

377
00:23:46,704 --> 00:23:50,606
And don't tell her I said this,
but the woman's always right.

378
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:57,837
I love my wife more
than anything in this world.

379
00:23:59,116 --> 00:24:00,708
And it....

380
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:05,151
It kills me that I can't give her a baby.

381
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:13,061
I really want a kid.

382
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:17,862
And when that day finally comes,
I'll learn how to be a good dad.

383
00:24:18,435 --> 00:24:20,164
But my wife...

384
00:24:20,671 --> 00:24:22,798
...she's already there.

385
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,131
She's a mother...

386
00:24:26,243 --> 00:24:28,268
...without a baby.

387
00:24:35,452 --> 00:24:37,283
Please?

388
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:51,263
You still want that baby?

389
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:09,078
God bless you, Chandler Bing!

390
00:25:22,766 --> 00:25:25,394
Turns out this sweater
is made for a woman.

391
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:29,762
So why are you still wearing it?

392
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,532
Because it's soft.

393
00:25:33,544 --> 00:25:35,102
Hey, so how was your date?

394
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,110
Not so good.

395
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:43,444
Well, looks like it's just
the two of us tonight, huh, buddy?

396
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,646
Yeah. And you know what?
We could do a lot worse.

397
00:25:46,824 --> 00:25:48,985
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

398
00:25:51,128 --> 00:25:54,063
Joey doesn't share food!
