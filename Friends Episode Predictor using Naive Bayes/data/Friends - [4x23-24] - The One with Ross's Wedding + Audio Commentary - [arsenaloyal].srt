1
00:00:02,247 --> 00:00:04,545
Hurry up!
The flight leaves in four hours!

2
00:00:04,783 --> 00:00:07,445
There could be traffic!
The plane could leave early!

3
00:00:07,653 --> 00:00:11,145
ln London, there could be
a line at customs! Come on!

4
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:16,155
Six-hour trip to London.
That's a lot of Monica.

5
00:00:17,462 --> 00:00:19,054
What have you got there?

6
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:21,222
Condoms, dude.

7
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:25,063
Well, how come the writing is in spanish?

8
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:28,973
Don't read my condoms.

9
00:00:29,508 --> 00:00:34,309
Passport, check. Camera, check.
Traveler's checks, check.

10
00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:36,811
-Who are you saying ''check'' to?
-Myself.

11
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:38,516
For remembering to pack a thing.

12
00:00:38,717 --> 00:00:41,413
You do a good thing,
you get a ''check.''

13
00:00:44,122 --> 00:00:46,249
Mom does it.
l never realized it was weird.

14
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:48,857
My mom used to put her head
in the oven.

15
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:53,720
Actually, only the one time.
But it's pretty weird.

16
00:00:58,036 --> 00:00:59,025
Are you ready yet?

17
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:01,705
-Got the tickets?
-Right here. Check!

18
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:05,705
lt's all London, baby!

19
00:01:05,944 --> 00:01:07,036
Here we go.

20
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:10,870
Got your passport?

21
00:01:11,883 --> 00:01:15,046
Third drawer of my dresser.
You don't want to lose that!

22
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,289
There it is!

23
00:01:24,563 --> 00:01:26,895
The One With Ross' Wedding

24
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:15,970
The vacuum's in my closet
on the left side.

25
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:18,579
Garbage bags are next
to the refrigerator.

26
00:02:18,784 --> 00:02:21,412
Rachel's gonna be here.
Can't l just ask her?

27
00:02:21,987 --> 00:02:24,217
Yeah, okay. Give that a try!

28
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:27,859
-Let's do it.
-Cheerio!

29
00:02:28,093 --> 00:02:29,492
London, baby!

30
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:31,825
That's not gonna get annoying.

31
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,156
London, baby!

32
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,199
You know what?
l was wrong.

33
00:02:37,402 --> 00:02:39,768
We're all here.
Let's get going!

34
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:42,131
l want to go over and hug you...

35
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,207
...and wish you luck,
but l can't get up.

36
00:02:45,477 --> 00:02:48,810
-l'll come hug you.
-Great, can you bring me the paper?

37
00:02:50,982 --> 00:02:53,075
-Have a great wedding.
-Thanks.

38
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:54,876
Chandler, l want to hug you too!

39
00:02:55,554 --> 00:02:58,751
You might as well bring my book
from your apartment.

40
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:07,555
-So we're off.
-Have fun!

41
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:11,867
-l can't believe you won't be there.
-l know.

42
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:14,698
Come. Why don't you come?

43
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:18,433
To London. Please?
lt would mean so much to me.

44
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,105
l gotta work. l'm sorry.

45
00:03:21,313 --> 00:03:23,110
Why can't you take
a couple of days off?

46
00:03:23,515 --> 00:03:26,348
Because l can't.
l told you.

47
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:27,813
This is my wedding.

48
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:31,555
Now we are late.
Let's go, let's go!

49
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:37,223
Fine, you'll watch it
on video when we get back.

50
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,022
Here you go, Phoebe!
Phoe-bo! Phoo-ba-la!

51
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:47,002
You!

52
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:49,370
Let's go!

53
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:51,041
Bye, Pheebs!

54
00:03:56,248 --> 00:03:58,307
London, baby!

55
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:02,411
Oh, God!

56
00:04:02,754 --> 00:04:03,948
Do you need a hug?

57
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:07,482
You don't have to bring me anything.

58
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:26,543
Chandler, do something!

59
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:31,944
-Do something!
-l am. l'm ignoring you.

60
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:34,279
l'll be the on-camera guy.

61
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:37,046
All right. First stop...

62
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:39,485
...Westminster Abbey.

63
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:41,617
What is that?

64
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:43,795
That's London, baby!

65
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:45,986
All right, the hotel's here.

66
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:47,289
Wait.

67
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:48,794
We want to go--

68
00:04:52,904 --> 00:04:54,064
l know.

69
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:56,764
l'm gonna have to go into the map.

70
00:05:02,247 --> 00:05:05,307
lf you see a little version
of me in there, kill it!

71
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:06,506
l got it.

72
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,682
Here we go!

73
00:05:11,456 --> 00:05:15,756
We're not gonna have to walk this way
the entire time, are we?

74
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:19,294
Man, you made me lose it!

75
00:05:28,106 --> 00:05:29,664
That was all before 1 0:00.

76
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:33,140
The caterer rang. lt'll be Chicken
Kiev, not Tarragon.

77
00:05:33,411 --> 00:05:35,777
Then the florist said
there are no tulips.

78
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:38,449
And the cellist has
carpal tunnel syndrome--

79
00:05:38,984 --> 00:05:40,611
Emily, honey. Okay?

80
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:43,045
Well, up yours too!

81
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:47,249
-What?
-Oh, that's not what it means.

82
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:50,223
-No! That's ''time out.''
-Sorry.

83
00:05:50,495 --> 00:05:54,397
Sweetie, relax.
Everything will be great, okay?

84
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,463
Come on, come on.

85
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:01,034
Chicken Kiev?

86
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:03,730
Doesn't that sound delicious
at the last minute?

87
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:08,306
Salmon would be
more elegant than chicken.

88
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,447
And you wouldn't worry
about the salmonella.

89
00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:15,712
But of course...

90
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:20,586
...with salmon you would have
to worry about the chicknella.

91
00:06:20,825 --> 00:06:22,850
l can't wait to see
where you're getting married.

92
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:26,553
lt's beautiful.
Her parents got married here.

93
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:28,790
l can't believe
they're tearing it down.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,096
lt's really the most lovely building.
lt's over--

95
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,099
Oh, my God!

96
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,839
lt's nice.

97
00:06:50,555 --> 00:06:52,750
Oh, my God!

98
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:54,925
What are we going to do?

99
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:57,353
Everything's gonna be all right.

100
00:06:57,562 --> 00:06:58,824
How's it gonna be all right?

101
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,554
l see that.

102
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:04,934
l talked to a guy,
and l found out what happened.

103
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,660
They tore it down early.

104
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:57,884
All right!

105
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:00,319
Westminster Abbey.

106
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:03,016
Hands down, best abbey l ever seen.

107
00:08:06,998 --> 00:08:09,262
What do you think of the Abbey?

108
00:08:10,068 --> 00:08:13,333
lt's great! They're thinking
of changing the name.

109
00:08:13,571 --> 00:08:16,699
-To what?
-To ''Put the Camera Away'' !

110
00:08:17,776 --> 00:08:20,404
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.

111
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:32,285
Don't worry, you'll find
some place to get married.

112
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:35,858
Sorry. Lucky this dress is red.

113
00:08:38,196 --> 00:08:40,926
We can't find another place.

114
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:42,665
Then we can't have the wedding.

115
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:47,100
l've ordered chicken, and salad,
and cake for a 1 50.

116
00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:49,302
What should be the most wonderfull day
of my life...

117
00:08:49,474 --> 00:08:53,069
...is rapidly turning into just Sunday
with a spectacular amount of food.

118
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:55,944
You're gonna find a place.

119
00:08:56,114 --> 00:09:00,244
But even if, God forbid, you didn't,
so you postpone the wedding.

120
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:01,885
ls that really so bad?

121
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:05,022
Think about it. You could take all the time
your needed to get everything that you want.

122
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,956
You could have tulips.
You could have salmon.

123
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:11,119
Salmon.

124
00:09:12,797 --> 00:09:16,494
l suppose it wouldn't be
the end of the world.

125
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:19,900
Oh, thank you.

126
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:22,005
Look, either way you're gonna get married.
You're gonna be happy.

127
00:09:22,173 --> 00:09:24,164
My mom's gonna like you better than me.

128
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:28,871
Oh, God. She has told you
that already, didn't she?

129
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:38,411
-Don't get up. What do you need?
-Nothing.

130
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:41,147
Come on. l'm here
to take care of you.

131
00:09:41,793 --> 00:09:43,658
Okay, l have a wedgie.

132
00:09:46,431 --> 00:09:47,796
That is all you.

133
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:52,535
What do you want for lunch?

134
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:54,931
l don't know.

135
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:57,071
l guess we have to eat.

136
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:58,673
Yeah, l do.

137
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:01,335
What's the matter?

138
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:04,207
l'm bummed the way
l left things with Ross.

139
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:08,509
l wish l didn't lie about work.
He seemed so mad at me.

140
00:10:08,786 --> 00:10:12,449
Don't be so hard on yourself.
lf l was still in love with some--

141
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:14,316
Still in love with?

142
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,127
l'm not in love with Ross.

143
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,027
Good!

144
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:24,861
Yeah, me neither.

145
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,837
l'm not at the wedding,
because he's my ex-boyfriend...

146
00:10:29,107 --> 00:10:31,132
...and that would be uncomfortable.

147
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,537
Not because l'm in love with him.
l like Ross as much as anyone.

148
00:10:36,814 --> 00:10:40,443
Clearly, l have feelings for him,
but they don't mean love.

149
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:44,986
l mean, do l still have
loving feelings for Ross? Yeah!

150
00:10:46,824 --> 00:10:48,689
l have continuing feelings of love.

151
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:51,794
But that doesn't mean
l'm still in love with him.

152
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:56,456
l have sexual feelings for him,
but l do love him.

153
00:10:58,369 --> 00:10:59,859
Oh, my God!

154
00:11:00,872 --> 00:11:03,033
Why didn't you tell me?

155
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:06,977
-We thought you knew!
-We?

156
00:11:07,212 --> 00:11:09,305
We all know.
We talk about it all the time.

157
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:13,676
You all know?
Does Ross know?

158
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:16,547
No! Ross doesn't know anything.

159
00:11:16,988 --> 00:11:18,853
And you didn't tell me!

160
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,423
We thought you knew.
lt's so obvious!

161
00:11:22,694 --> 00:11:24,525
lt would be like telling Monica:

162
00:11:24,762 --> 00:11:27,390
''Hey, you like things clean.''

163
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:32,533
Or, you know, ''Hey, Joey, you're gay.''

164
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:35,528
What?

165
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,809
Oh, please, she's always got
a broom in her hand.

166
00:11:48,486 --> 00:11:53,219
What are you in the market for?
Scarves, souvenir postcards....

167
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:55,391
Check this out!

168
00:11:57,495 --> 00:11:59,827
That's the stuff!
What do you think?

169
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:03,363
l won't need that
''l'm with stupid'' T-shirt anymore.

170
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:06,933
Well, l like it. Here you go.

171
00:12:07,171 --> 00:12:10,834
You're not really buying that.
Haven't you embarrassed me enough?

172
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:12,269
Oh, l embarrass you?

173
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,604
How can l answer when
l'm pretending l don't know you?

174
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:19,414
He's just jealous.
All Londoners wear them.

175
00:12:19,684 --> 00:12:23,450
Really? Then how come no one here
anywhere is wearing one?

176
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:26,014
They're all tourists.

177
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:30,117
lf you insist on wearing that
in public...

178
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:33,693
...you're gonna spend the afternoon
all by yourself.

179
00:12:39,804 --> 00:12:43,262
lf you make me choose between
you and the hat, l choose the hat.

180
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,133
-Good choice.
-Thanks.

181
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,109
That's it! l'm out of here.
l won't be embarrassed any more.

182
00:12:58,656 --> 00:13:01,454
How are you doing? Joey Tribbiani, America.

183
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:12,129
l spoke to your dad,
and you know what?

184
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,531
He thinks we can find a new hall.

185
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:17,240
-We don't have to.
-You found a place?

186
00:13:17,475 --> 00:13:20,774
No, but Monica and l were talking...

187
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:24,208
...and l was so upset about the hall
being knocked down...

188
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:27,441
...and she suggested we put
the wedding off for a bit.

189
00:13:30,822 --> 00:13:31,948
She said what?

190
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:35,319
lf l won't be happy with somewhere
we'd find in a day...

191
00:13:35,593 --> 00:13:37,424
...we should postpone it.

192
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:41,796
Postpone it.

193
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:47,766
Do you think Monica realizes
how much our parents spent on this?

194
00:13:47,972 --> 00:13:52,272
Do you think my sister's teeny,
tiny, little brain comprehends...

195
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,842
...that people took time
out of their lives...

196
00:13:55,113 --> 00:13:58,139
...to fly thousands of miles
to be here?

197
00:14:02,353 --> 00:14:03,479
This isn't right.

198
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:08,080
l realize that people
are gonna be disappointed.

199
00:14:08,326 --> 00:14:10,453
But l'm sure they'll come back.

200
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:14,153
l can't ask people to do that.
Would you?

201
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:15,922
Don't you point your pants at me!

202
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:19,163
We have no choice.

203
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:22,497
Anywhere half-decent
will have been booked.

204
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:25,265
Don't you understand?
This is our wedding!

205
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:30,174
Postponing it is not an option.
This is when we're getting married.

206
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:33,407
-You're saying it's now or never?
-l'm saying it's now.

207
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:35,916
-Or?
-There's no ''or'' in mine!

208
00:14:36,187 --> 00:14:38,087
What is wrong with these pants?

209
00:14:40,591 --> 00:14:43,185
lt's not the pants.
lt's you who's backwards.

210
00:14:43,394 --> 00:14:46,591
lf you don't understand
how important this is to me...

211
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:48,595
...perhaps we shouldn't marry at all!

212
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,564
Emily, no! Wait, stop!
Emily, please--

213
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:04,941
Did shopping help you
feel any better?

214
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:06,912
Manhattan doesn't have enough stores.

215
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:11,778
l can help you get over him.

216
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:13,251
You can?

217
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:15,823
l need you to bring me
photos of Ross...

218
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:18,721
...and a small piece of chocolate...

219
00:15:18,963 --> 00:15:20,828
...and a glass of tepid water.

220
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:23,123
ls this where you throw stuff...

221
00:15:23,334 --> 00:15:27,668
...in a bag with graveyard dirt
and hang it from a north-facing tree?

222
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:30,430
Only if you have the hiccups too.

223
00:15:33,377 --> 00:15:36,574
The chocolate and water are for me.
l didn't feel like getting up.

224
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,248
l'll show you a picture of Ross.

225
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,250
And you remember all
the bad things about him.

226
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:47,684
-Focus on his flaws.
-l can do that.

227
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:50,189
l did that
while we were going out.

228
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:55,030
Before we start, l want to say,
for the record, l love Ross.

229
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:57,131
He's such a great guy.

230
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,202
Close your eyes.

231
00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:07,543
lmagine that you're with Ross.

232
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:09,803
lmagine that you're kissing him.

233
00:16:10,515 --> 00:16:13,609
You're running your hands
all over his body.

234
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:16,445
You run your hands
through his hair but--

235
00:16:16,654 --> 00:16:20,021
Gross!
lt's some kind of grease.

236
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:25,653
l don't know.

237
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:28,627
His hair never bothered me that much.

238
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:31,664
lt was more crunchy
than it was greasy.

239
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:36,532
This will be harder than l thought.

240
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:39,037
Let's try some aversion therapy.

241
00:16:40,645 --> 00:16:42,545
Look at the picture.

242
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:52,583
How do you feel now?

243
00:16:52,823 --> 00:16:54,814
Well, l like you less.

244
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:27,424
Sorry.

245
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:31,420
l'm sorry. l shouldn't have said
you were embarrassing me.

246
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:32,926
That wasn't cool.

247
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,191
lf it makes you feel any better,
l've had a really lousy day.

248
00:17:38,502 --> 00:17:39,764
Me too.

249
00:17:40,338 --> 00:17:41,669
-Yeah?
-No!

250
00:17:43,307 --> 00:17:45,104
l had the best day ever!

251
00:17:46,577 --> 00:17:48,602
Dude, check this out!

252
00:17:58,689 --> 00:18:00,953
<i>Tell my friend you like my hat.</i>

253
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:04,058
-<i>What's your friend's name?</i>
-<i>Chandler.</i>

254
00:18:04,295 --> 00:18:05,353
<i>Hi, Chandler.</i>

255
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:09,293
-That's--
-That's Fergie, baby!

256
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:15,235
<i>Joey says you don't like his hat,</i>
<i>but I think it's kind of dashing.</i>

257
00:18:16,974 --> 00:18:19,534
<i>So I hear you're single now.</i>

258
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,745
-<i>Yeah, I don't like the hat that much.</i>
-<i>Okay.</i>

259
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:25,443
When did you--?
How?

260
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,884
l was trying to get
to Buckingham Palace.

261
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:30,076
So l'm in my map and--

262
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:36,758
l understand you had
a talk with Emily.

263
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:38,451
Yes, l did.

264
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:41,596
And you are welcome.

265
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:43,622
Am l?

266
00:18:45,636 --> 00:18:48,104
Was it your idea
to postpone the wedding?

267
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:52,800
-l'm going to the bathroom.
-Wait up!

268
00:18:56,447 --> 00:18:59,507
Since you're the fix-it lady,
here's a pickle:

269
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:04,244
What do you do when the bride says
she doesn't want the wedding at all?

270
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:07,349
She said that?
Why?

271
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:11,425
l don't know. l said it was stupid
to put off the wedding...

272
00:19:11,662 --> 00:19:14,096
...and she, like, flipped out.

273
00:19:14,598 --> 00:19:17,965
Oh, my God!
You're even dumber than l am.

274
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:20,526
Excuse me?

275
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:23,939
How long have you been planning
this wedding?

276
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:25,469
l don't know. A month?

277
00:19:25,676 --> 00:19:28,873
Emily's probably been planning it
since she was 5.

278
00:19:29,113 --> 00:19:32,776
Ever since the first time she hung
a pillowcase from her head.

279
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:36,381
That's what we did.

280
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:39,815
We dreamed about the perfect wedding.

281
00:19:40,024 --> 00:19:42,458
ln the perfect place.

282
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:45,791
With the perfect
four-tiered wedding cake.

283
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:48,855
With the little people on top.

284
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,037
But the most important part...

285
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:03,746
...is that we had the perfect guy...

286
00:20:04,014 --> 00:20:08,144
...who understood just how important
all that stuff was.

287
00:20:10,054 --> 00:20:12,079
l had no idea.

288
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:17,359
That pillowcase thing, l thought
you were doing <i>The Flying Nun.</i>

289
00:20:19,263 --> 00:20:21,527
Sometimes we were.

290
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:24,829
Come on.

291
00:20:25,202 --> 00:20:27,102
Help me figure out what to do.

292
00:20:33,844 --> 00:20:36,074
Pretty intense, huh?

293
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:41,684
l hope Ross didn't think we left
because we were uncomfortable here.

294
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:49,523
l hope he did.

295
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:59,330
l thought of a good flaw.
Ross pops his gum.

296
00:20:59,537 --> 00:21:01,300
Oh, right.

297
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:04,869
-Wait a minute. l do that too.
-l know, it drives me crazy.

298
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,679
l'll get it.

299
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,815
Pheebs, it's Joey.

300
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:15,484
Hey, Joey!

301
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,218
l saw someone that looks just
like you on the subway.

302
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,824
l was going to say hi, then l figured
he doesn't care he looks like you.

303
00:21:25,596 --> 00:21:27,757
That just cost me 4 bucks.

304
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:32,057
l called to see how the chick
and the duck are doing.

305
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:35,761
They're having fun with Aunt Phoebe.
Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful.

306
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:39,072
So do you miss me?

307
00:21:39,276 --> 00:21:42,143
Kind of, but l've been
having too much fun.

308
00:21:42,346 --> 00:21:43,745
You're not homesick yet?

309
00:21:44,315 --> 00:21:47,148
l don't think so.

310
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:49,915
Well, the seven of us miss you.

311
00:21:53,624 --> 00:21:55,819
-Who's seven?
-Me, Rachel...

312
00:21:56,026 --> 00:21:57,357
...the birds, the babies.

313
00:21:57,628 --> 00:21:59,858
The babies miss me?

314
00:22:00,631 --> 00:22:04,567
Of course they do, or l'm just really hungry.

315
00:22:06,503 --> 00:22:07,527
Pizza guy's here!

316
00:22:07,738 --> 00:22:09,865
You ordered pizza without me?

317
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:14,533
But we were thinking about you.
We ordered the Joey Special.

318
00:22:14,745 --> 00:22:16,406
Two pizzas?

319
00:22:18,515 --> 00:22:20,779
-Gotta go! Talk to you later.
-<i>Wait!</i>

320
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:22,885
Where did you get it from?

321
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:37,361
<i>And they're always glad you came</i>

322
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:41,169
<i>You want to be where you can see</i>

323
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:43,669
<i>Your troubles are all the same</i>

324
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:48,174
<i>You want to be</i>
<i>Where everybody knows your name</i>

325
00:22:52,783 --> 00:22:55,047
Why have you brought me here?

326
00:22:55,252 --> 00:22:56,446
You'll see.

327
00:22:56,954 --> 00:22:58,581
This wedding won't happen.

328
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:03,590
Ross.

329
00:23:03,861 --> 00:23:06,261
But imagine a lot more lights...

330
00:23:06,563 --> 00:23:09,088
...and fewer bricks...

331
00:23:09,366 --> 00:23:11,891
...and flowers and candles.

332
00:23:12,102 --> 00:23:14,730
And the musicians can go over here.

333
00:23:14,972 --> 00:23:17,406
The chairs can face this way and--

334
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:18,730
You go.

335
00:23:20,144 --> 00:23:24,103
But if you don't love this,
we'll do it any other place or time.

336
00:23:24,381 --> 00:23:25,973
Really, it's fine.

337
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,877
Whatever you want.

338
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,081
lt's perfect.

339
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:33,749
And, l don't know, if it rains--

340
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,550
Then we'll get wet.

341
00:23:41,832 --> 00:23:43,322
l don't even have a date.

342
00:23:47,738 --> 00:23:49,672
Do you remember
where the duck food is?

343
00:23:49,907 --> 00:23:52,637
ln the guys' apartment,
under the sink. Why?

344
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:54,842
Because l'm going to London.

345
00:23:55,112 --> 00:23:56,977
What? What do you mean?

346
00:23:57,247 --> 00:23:59,408
l have to tell Ross l love him.

347
00:23:59,616 --> 00:24:02,608
Take care and don't have
the babies till l get back.

348
00:24:04,288 --> 00:24:06,916
But what about all
the finding-his-flaws stuff we've been doing?

349
00:24:07,157 --> 00:24:08,988
Yeah, that didn't work.

350
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:11,194
You can't go.
Ross loves Emily.

351
00:24:11,428 --> 00:24:14,158
l know, but l have
to tell him how l feel.

352
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:18,925
He deserves all the information
to make an informed decision.

353
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:22,105
You're going
because you hope he'll say:

354
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:25,240
''l love you too.
Forget the British chippy.''

355
00:24:27,578 --> 00:24:28,670
You think he will?

356
00:24:28,912 --> 00:24:32,678
No, because he's in love
with the British chippy!

357
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:37,982
You're just gonna mess with his head
and ruin his wedding.

358
00:24:38,255 --> 00:24:41,019
lt's too late!
You missed your chance.

359
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:43,987
l'm sorry.
This must be hard.

360
00:24:45,696 --> 00:24:47,527
But it's over.

361
00:24:50,934 --> 00:24:54,426
No, it's not over
until someone says, ''l do.''

362
00:24:55,139 --> 00:24:56,834
l do! l do!

363
00:25:03,847 --> 00:25:07,806
Like l can really chase you.
l'm carrying a litter!

364
00:25:17,828 --> 00:25:19,523
The Waltham residence.

365
00:25:19,863 --> 00:25:21,694
ls this Emily's parents' house?

366
00:25:21,965 --> 00:25:24,058
<i>This is the housekeeper speaking.</i>

367
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:29,001
And, by the way, that is not how one
addresses a person on the telephone.

368
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:31,941
<i>First one identifies oneself...</i>

369
00:25:32,242 --> 00:25:36,440
...and then asks for the person
with whom one wishes to speak.

370
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:39,681
What are you saying?

371
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:43,781
Now, let us try that again, shall we?

372
00:25:43,954 --> 00:25:45,819
No!

373
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:49,049
Oh, my God!

374
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,662
-The Waltham residence.
-<i>Hello.</i>

375
00:25:55,866 --> 00:25:59,029
This is Phoebe Buffay.
l was wondering, please...

376
00:25:59,236 --> 00:26:01,898
...if it's not
too much trouble, please...

377
00:26:02,206 --> 00:26:05,198
...might l speak with
Miss Emily Waltham, please?

378
00:26:05,976 --> 00:26:08,774
Miss Waltham is
at the rehearsal dinner.

379
00:26:09,046 --> 00:26:12,948
And it is not polite
to make fun of people. Goodbye.

380
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:17,185
l'll be nice, l swear. Could you just
give me the number for where they are?

381
00:26:17,387 --> 00:26:21,517
l'm afraid l'm not at liberty
to divulge that information.

382
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:25,786
Somebody is on their way to ruin
the wedding, and l have to warn somebody.

383
00:26:26,063 --> 00:26:29,055
So if you don't give me that number,
l'm gonna come over there...

384
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:33,726
...and l'm gonna kick your snooty ass
all the way to New Gloukenshire!

385
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:36,506
Hello? Hello?

386
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:39,301
She knew l could kick her ass.

387
00:26:44,948 --> 00:26:48,782
-Hi, sweetheart.
-Mom, Dad.

388
00:26:48,952 --> 00:26:50,146
Sorry we're late.

389
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,481
My fault.
l insisted on riding the tube.

390
00:26:52,723 --> 00:26:54,748
Judy, the kids!

391
00:26:55,425 --> 00:26:58,053
Jack, that's what they call the subway.

392
00:26:59,463 --> 00:27:02,728
-l thought--
-Dad, we got it.

393
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:05,432
Here comes my dad and stepmom.

394
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:06,829
Mr. and Mrs. Geller.

395
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,901
-This is Steven...
-Hello, darling.

396
00:27:09,173 --> 00:27:10,663
...and Andrea Waltham.

397
00:27:10,874 --> 00:27:12,774
Very nice to meet you.

398
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,839
Darling, the Gellers.

399
00:27:15,078 --> 00:27:16,705
Darling, it's the Gellers.

400
00:27:16,947 --> 00:27:20,542
She's very self-involved.
l should never have married her.

401
00:27:22,686 --> 00:27:24,244
-lt's the Gellers.
-Where?

402
00:27:24,454 --> 00:27:26,388
That's one and that's another one.

403
00:27:28,058 --> 00:27:29,116
Lovely to meet you.

404
00:27:29,393 --> 00:27:31,623
Nice of you to offer to pay
for half the wedding.

405
00:27:31,862 --> 00:27:34,387
The hell with tradition.
We're happy to do it.

406
00:27:34,631 --> 00:27:37,361
We know how expensive
weddings can be.

407
00:27:37,601 --> 00:27:40,570
Besides, this may be
the only wedding we get to throw.

408
00:27:41,838 --> 00:27:44,602
A joke that's funny in all countries.

409
00:27:48,312 --> 00:27:49,870
Sir?

410
00:27:50,147 --> 00:27:53,514
-What's in it?
-Goat cheese, watercress and pancetta.

411
00:27:57,988 --> 00:27:59,182
That's not food.

412
00:28:02,993 --> 00:28:05,985
Everything's different here.
l want to go home.

413
00:28:07,698 --> 00:28:09,632
l miss my family, the coffeehouse.

414
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:12,164
l can't even remember
what Phoebe looks like!

415
00:28:13,637 --> 00:28:14,831
lt's been three days.

416
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:18,666
Okay, you're just homesick.

417
00:28:18,942 --> 00:28:22,173
Would you just try to relax
and just enjoy yourself?

418
00:28:22,846 --> 00:28:25,110
You're different here too.

419
00:28:26,183 --> 00:28:28,208
You're mean in England!

420
00:28:29,653 --> 00:28:30,950
What the hell?

421
00:28:31,154 --> 00:28:32,143
What's up, Dad?

422
00:28:32,356 --> 00:28:35,052
This bill for my half of the wedding.
lt's insane.

423
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:37,886
How can it be so much?
The reception's at their house.

424
00:28:38,128 --> 00:28:42,064
Flowers, liquor.
Re-carpet first floor?

425
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,961
New guest bath, landscaping.

426
00:28:45,235 --> 00:28:47,465
l'm paying to remodel this guy's house.

427
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:50,538
l'm gonna give that son of a bitch
a piece of my mind.

428
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:52,097
Please.

429
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:54,903
l don't want anything
to upset Emily tonight.

430
00:28:55,145 --> 00:28:57,978
She's had a hard enough
couple of days as it is.

431
00:28:58,181 --> 00:29:00,581
Here.
Let me go talk to him.

432
00:29:00,784 --> 00:29:04,083
You tell him no one takes advantage
of the Gellers.

433
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:10,482
Sometimes l forget
how powerful you can be.

434
00:29:14,631 --> 00:29:17,327
And l'm gonna go get drunk.

435
00:29:22,973 --> 00:29:25,441
-Hello.
-Hello.

436
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:27,636
When is your next
flight to London?

437
00:29:27,844 --> 00:29:30,210
There's one leaving in 30 minutes.

438
00:29:30,414 --> 00:29:32,848
And l do have one seat left.

439
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,578
Thank you, thank you.

440
00:29:34,785 --> 00:29:38,744
The last-minute fare
on this ticket is $2700.

441
00:29:40,257 --> 00:29:43,226
Huh. How about 600?

442
00:29:43,393 --> 00:29:46,851
-Sorry.
-How about 600 and these earrings?

443
00:29:48,098 --> 00:29:51,625
They prefer it if l don't barter.

444
00:29:51,868 --> 00:29:54,564
l don't think l have enough left
on my credit card.

445
00:29:54,771 --> 00:29:57,239
You can split it with another card.

446
00:29:57,441 --> 00:29:59,375
How about five?

447
00:30:01,178 --> 00:30:02,509
Thank you.

448
00:30:02,746 --> 00:30:05,112
l'm just going to need
to see your passport.

449
00:30:07,951 --> 00:30:12,354
l don't have it, but l can tell you
exactly where it is on my nightstand.

450
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:17,459
You know what?
l have my driver's license.

451
00:30:19,096 --> 00:30:21,189
And l have a 20.

452
00:30:25,836 --> 00:30:29,272
Face it. My father is not going to pay
for the built-in barbecue.

453
00:30:29,573 --> 00:30:32,599
And believe me, you can
kiss your gazebo goodbye.

454
00:30:34,378 --> 00:30:37,370
l might be able
to get you the new lawn.

455
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:40,345
Then you have to give us
the lawn ornaments.

456
00:30:41,218 --> 00:30:45,177
l go back there with lawn ornaments,
he'll laugh in my face.

457
00:30:45,522 --> 00:30:49,390
This is ridiculous.
l mean, we had an agreement.

458
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:52,559
Will you say something, Steven?

459
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,364
Don't take that tone with me.

460
00:30:58,034 --> 00:31:00,059
All right, you can.

461
00:31:06,143 --> 00:31:07,542
Thank God!

462
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:10,075
You changed your mind.

463
00:31:10,247 --> 00:31:13,273
You probably want to be alone,
you don't want to talk about it.

464
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,077
You're doing the right thing.

465
00:31:16,386 --> 00:31:17,717
Where are you going?

466
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:19,354
What are you doing? No, wait.

467
00:31:20,357 --> 00:31:23,520
Why am l always pregnant
when she does that?

468
00:31:33,003 --> 00:31:35,028
l'd like to make a toast
to Ross and Emily.

469
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:36,963
My big toast is tomorrow.

470
00:31:37,207 --> 00:31:41,303
This is kind of my little toast,
or Melba toast, if you will.

471
00:31:44,581 --> 00:31:46,048
Okay.

472
00:31:46,216 --> 00:31:50,915
l've known Ross for a long time. l knew him
when he was with his first girlfriend.

473
00:31:51,455 --> 00:31:55,357
l thought things were going to work out
for him, until the day he over-inflated her.

474
00:31:59,729 --> 00:32:01,390
Oh, dear God!

475
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:06,994
Hello, Waltham lnteriors.

476
00:32:07,204 --> 00:32:08,637
Mrs. Waltham.

477
00:32:08,905 --> 00:32:12,568
l need to speak with one of the best men
or Ross' sister, Monica.

478
00:32:13,243 --> 00:32:17,407
-Who is this?
-Phoebe, one of Ross' best friends.

479
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:19,710
How did you get this number?

480
00:32:19,883 --> 00:32:24,252
l got it from your maid.
She's a bitch, but l wore her down.

481
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:27,756
lf you're one of Ross' best friends,
why aren't you here?

482
00:32:27,991 --> 00:32:31,222
l can't fly.
l'm having my brother's babies.

483
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,458
Am l on the radio?

484
00:32:40,904 --> 00:32:43,429
Can l talk to one of them?
lt's important.

485
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,734
l'm bored of you now.
l'm going to cut you off.

486
00:32:47,611 --> 00:32:51,980
Oh, okay, l'm going
to have to kick her ass too.

487
00:32:52,382 --> 00:32:57,649
We're excited that Ross and Emily are
getting married at Montgomery Hall.

488
00:32:57,821 --> 00:33:00,654
To think, my friend getting
married in Monty Hall.

489
00:33:01,825 --> 00:33:03,019
Come on, Monty Hall!

490
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,956
<i>Let's Make a Deal.</i>
Come on, you people!

491
00:33:07,197 --> 00:33:10,223
All right, forget it.
Congratulations, Ross and Emily.

492
00:33:14,838 --> 00:33:18,035
Best man number two, Joey Tribbiani.

493
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:21,141
l'm not good with the jokes
like Chandler here.

494
00:33:24,648 --> 00:33:27,276
Congratulations to the happy couple.

495
00:33:28,051 --> 00:33:31,543
l first met Ross
in this coffeehouse back home.

496
00:33:38,562 --> 00:33:39,790
Home.

497
00:33:41,197 --> 00:33:42,858
New York City.

498
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:45,397
Where everybody knows my name.

499
00:33:48,338 --> 00:33:49,532
Anyway...

500
00:33:50,507 --> 00:33:51,804
...l love you guys.

501
00:33:52,242 --> 00:33:54,972
But not as much as l love America.

502
00:33:57,314 --> 00:33:59,874
Can we please go home now?

503
00:34:01,051 --> 00:34:02,678
Are you going home?

504
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:05,581
l was hoping to get
to know you better.

505
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,085
l'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.

506
00:34:14,831 --> 00:34:16,560
l was laughing.

507
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:19,057
Out loud?

508
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:23,933
l didn't want everyone
to think l was stupid.

509
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:25,330
So how are you?

510
00:34:25,675 --> 00:34:29,372
My mother's driving me crazy.
But Ross is getting married. l'm happy.

511
00:34:29,546 --> 00:34:31,776
l'm not going to let anything spoil that.

512
00:34:33,116 --> 00:34:36,950
l just want to say that
Ross is a wonderful young man.

513
00:34:37,487 --> 00:34:39,512
Thanks. We like him.

514
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:44,324
My God! You must have been
a teenager when you had him.

515
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:53,430
There's no way in hell
l'm paying for it.

516
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:56,161
Look, we're down to just one point.

517
00:34:56,373 --> 00:34:59,570
Could we please just settle it
after the wedding?

518
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:03,109
Fine, but l'm not paying
for your wine cellar...

519
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,783
...you thieving, would-be-speaking-
German-if-it-weren't-for-us, cheap little man!

520
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:16,691
The guy was hammered. There's
no way you look like Ross' mother.

521
00:35:18,294 --> 00:35:20,762
-Then why would he say it?
-Because he's crazy!

522
00:35:20,964 --> 00:35:25,230
He came up to me earlier and thanked me
for my very moving performance in <i>Titanic.</i>

523
00:35:28,304 --> 00:35:31,068
My mother's right.
l'll never get married.

524
00:35:31,608 --> 00:35:33,769
You know what, that is--

525
00:35:34,077 --> 00:35:36,068
Who wouldn't want you?

526
00:35:36,246 --> 00:35:39,511
Please! l'm a single mom
with a 30-year-old son.

527
00:35:43,386 --> 00:35:46,822
-Hi, l'm back. Listen, l need to--
-Hello.

528
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:49,582
Hello. l need to get on that 1 1 :00 flight.

529
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:52,284
l'm afraid that plane's already
pulled away from the gate.

530
00:35:52,462 --> 00:35:56,660
You're going to have to call that plane and
tell them to swing around and pick me up.

531
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,728
-Can't do that.
-Sure, you know what?

532
00:35:59,903 --> 00:36:05,341
We'll just tell them that there was, like,
a problem with, like, the engine.

533
00:36:05,508 --> 00:36:08,966
l'm afraid l'm going to have
to ask you to step aside, miss.

534
00:36:09,145 --> 00:36:12,376
Look, if l don't get to London
he is gonna marry that other girl.

535
00:36:12,549 --> 00:36:15,416
Can't imagine why.

536
00:36:15,885 --> 00:36:17,216
All right. You know what?

537
00:36:17,387 --> 00:36:22,290
l am not leaving here until
you call that plane back.

538
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:31,095
l'm getting married today!

539
00:36:33,169 --> 00:36:34,158
Morning.

540
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:37,066
-l'm getting married today!
-Yeah, you are.

541
00:36:40,677 --> 00:36:42,770
Do you think he knew l was here?

542
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,666
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

543
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,774
lf you're going to do that
throughout the flight, tell me now...

544
00:37:12,942 --> 00:37:15,536
...so that l can take a sedative.

545
00:37:15,712 --> 00:37:18,180
Or perhaps slip you one.

546
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:23,875
l'm sorry. l'm very sorry. Sorry.

547
00:37:24,888 --> 00:37:27,584
lt's just, l'm kind of excited.

548
00:37:27,757 --> 00:37:30,021
l'm going to London...

549
00:37:30,193 --> 00:37:33,321
...to tell this guy that l love him.

550
00:37:42,672 --> 00:37:45,698
Well, l've never done that with you before.

551
00:37:48,378 --> 00:37:49,743
So how are you?

552
00:37:50,513 --> 00:37:51,741
You okay?

553
00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:54,073
Yeah. Yeah. You?

554
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,980
Oh, yes. Yes.

555
00:37:57,153 --> 00:37:58,313
You?

556
00:37:59,756 --> 00:38:01,348
We did you.

557
00:38:03,693 --> 00:38:05,593
Well....

558
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:08,889
-l better get going.
-Absolutely.

559
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:13,495
Could you not look?

560
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,531
l don't want to look.

561
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:31,586
Where the hell have you been?

562
00:38:32,856 --> 00:38:37,486
l spent the night out.
l met this cute bridesmaid. She is so--

563
00:38:37,727 --> 00:38:38,989
l don't want to hear it!

564
00:38:39,362 --> 00:38:42,627
Pheebs, you know you're still
my number-one girl.

565
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,363
No. No. We have an emergency.
Rachel's coming to London.

566
00:38:47,637 --> 00:38:49,161
Great!

567
00:38:49,973 --> 00:38:53,670
No, it's not great. She's coming
to tell Ross that she loves him.

568
00:38:53,877 --> 00:38:54,969
But he loves Emily.

569
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:56,974
l know that!

570
00:38:57,647 --> 00:39:00,480
You have to stop her.
She's going to ruin the wedding.

571
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,447
Okay.

572
00:39:02,752 --> 00:39:05,516
-All right, so--
-<i>Hold on, hold on.</i>

573
00:39:05,688 --> 00:39:08,589
Rachel coming.

574
00:39:11,394 --> 00:39:13,294
Do...

575
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,160
...something.

576
00:39:16,466 --> 00:39:18,434
l've done my part, okay?

577
00:39:18,635 --> 00:39:21,069
lt's your responsibility now.
The burden is off me.

578
00:39:21,237 --> 00:39:22,704
-Right?
-Right.

579
00:39:23,406 --> 00:39:25,306
So tell me about this girl.

580
00:39:27,477 --> 00:39:30,878
And so then l realized,
all the stuff that l had been doing...

581
00:39:31,047 --> 00:39:35,074
...proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about
why l couldn't come to the wedding...

582
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:38,015
-...was all just a way--
-Oh, oh, oh, oh!

583
00:39:38,655 --> 00:39:40,452
l'm sorry, can l interrupt?

584
00:39:40,623 --> 00:39:46,255
l just want to say that you are
a horrible, horrible person.

585
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,692
Pardon me?

586
00:39:48,865 --> 00:39:52,460
You say you love this man, and yet you're
about to ruin the happiest day of his life.

587
00:39:52,635 --> 00:39:54,899
l'm afraid l have to agree
with your friend Pheebs.

588
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:58,563
This is a terrible, terrible plan.

589
00:39:58,741 --> 00:40:02,108
-But he has to know how l feel.
-But why?

590
00:40:02,278 --> 00:40:06,476
He loves this Emily person.
No good can come of this.

591
00:40:06,883 --> 00:40:10,819
-Well, l think you're wrong.
-Oh, no.

592
00:40:14,757 --> 00:40:20,787
Well, he doesn't really love her.
lt's just a rebound thing from me.

593
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:24,961
-You'll see.
-Fortunately l won't.

594
00:40:25,134 --> 00:40:29,764
And by the way, it seems to be
perfectly clear that you were on a break.

595
00:40:37,647 --> 00:40:40,013
Do something.

596
00:40:41,451 --> 00:40:43,316
Something.

597
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:48,919
-Have you seen Monica?
-l'm not seeing Monica!

598
00:40:52,795 --> 00:40:54,660
-What?
-What?

599
00:40:55,198 --> 00:40:58,861
We gotta find her. Rachel's coming
to tell Ross she loves him.

600
00:40:59,102 --> 00:41:01,900
-Oh, my God!
-l know. Do you know where Monica is?

601
00:41:02,138 --> 00:41:06,632
No. What's with the third degree?
Why not just shine a light in my eyes?

602
00:41:18,354 --> 00:41:20,914
Oh, my God!

603
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:23,655
lt's like a fairyland.

604
00:41:23,926 --> 00:41:26,087
l know. lt's horrible, isn't it?

605
00:41:26,763 --> 00:41:30,164
l love it. l only hope
my wedding looks this good.

606
00:41:30,366 --> 00:41:32,391
-l just hope--
-You can let some of them go by.

607
00:41:36,506 --> 00:41:38,235
Start looking out for Rachel.

608
00:41:38,508 --> 00:41:41,443
l'll cover the front door.
You watch that big hole.

609
00:41:41,711 --> 00:41:44,077
And l got Chandler covering Ross.

610
00:41:44,347 --> 00:41:46,440
Why would l care where Chandler is?

611
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,512
You know...

612
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:52,280
...sometimes l don't even
like Chandler.

613
00:41:53,456 --> 00:41:55,287
Okay.

614
00:41:57,393 --> 00:41:58,382
l do.

615
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,523
l do.

616
00:42:01,364 --> 00:42:02,797
l do.

617
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:05,661
-You're right. lt's the second one.
-Right?

618
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:10,728
Hello, Joey.

619
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,498
Hey, Felicity.

620
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,401
l thought about you all day.

621
00:42:18,114 --> 00:42:19,604
Talk New York to me again.

622
00:42:20,817 --> 00:42:22,842
Forget about it.

623
00:42:23,853 --> 00:42:24,842
How you doing?

624
00:42:29,192 --> 00:42:32,320
There's nothing to discuss.
We're not paying for your wine cellar.

625
00:42:32,528 --> 00:42:34,519
You have to meet me in the middle here.

626
00:42:34,831 --> 00:42:37,629
My foot's gonna meet
the middle of your ass.

627
00:42:39,535 --> 00:42:42,698
-What's going on?
-Everything's under control.

628
00:42:42,939 --> 00:42:46,033
You want a piece of me, sir?
ls that what you're saying?

629
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:51,143
That's it! Parents! Parents!
Back away!

630
00:42:51,447 --> 00:42:53,108
This is our wedding day!

631
00:42:53,783 --> 00:42:55,648
From now on, everyone gets along.

632
00:42:55,852 --> 00:42:58,047
And if l hear one more word...

633
00:42:58,321 --> 00:43:00,949
...no grandchildren!
That's right!

634
00:43:01,124 --> 00:43:03,319
-Okay, okay.
-Sorry, old boy.

635
00:43:06,462 --> 00:43:08,953
l could kill you
with my thumb, you know.

636
00:43:13,069 --> 00:43:14,468
What was all that about?

637
00:43:14,804 --> 00:43:17,637
lt was this disagreement over--

638
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:21,533
My God! You look beautiful.

639
00:43:24,046 --> 00:43:27,243
You're not meant to see me
before the wedding. lt's bad luck.

640
00:43:27,483 --> 00:43:30,850
l think we've had all the bad luck
we're going to have.

641
00:44:07,557 --> 00:44:09,525
My God, Rachel!

642
00:44:12,094 --> 00:44:14,619
You're here.
l can't believe it.

643
00:44:17,066 --> 00:44:18,533
What happened?
Why are you here?

644
00:44:18,901 --> 00:44:20,698
l just came to--

645
00:44:24,907 --> 00:44:27,137
l just needed to tell you...

646
00:44:29,879 --> 00:44:31,938
...congratulations.

647
00:45:04,013 --> 00:45:05,378
Hello, Waltham lnteriors.

648
00:45:05,815 --> 00:45:07,806
Mrs. Waltham? lt's Phoebe.

649
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:10,576
Why?

650
00:45:11,153 --> 00:45:15,556
Can l talk to one of the best men?
This is going to be the last time.

651
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:19,123
There's a girl on the phone for you.

652
00:45:19,729 --> 00:45:20,957
Great!

653
00:45:24,267 --> 00:45:25,256
<i>It's Phoebe.</i>

654
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:26,693
Did you stop Rachel?

655
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:29,667
No, but it's okay. She just came in
and gave him a hug. That's it.

656
00:45:29,872 --> 00:45:32,033
-Nothing got ruined?
-<i>No</i>.

657
00:45:32,308 --> 00:45:34,435
That's so great!

658
00:45:35,044 --> 00:45:36,773
So, what's going on now?

659
00:45:38,614 --> 00:45:40,479
l'm walking down the aisle.

660
00:45:42,785 --> 00:45:44,446
Still walking.

661
00:45:44,987 --> 00:45:48,320
l'm about to pass the bridesmaid
l hooked up with last night.

662
00:45:48,491 --> 00:45:50,220
Hey.

663
00:45:51,327 --> 00:45:53,488
l just told her ''hey.''

664
00:45:54,096 --> 00:45:56,121
l'm at the front with Ross.

665
00:45:56,365 --> 00:45:57,764
lt's Phoebe!

666
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:04,670
He looks pretty mad.

667
00:46:05,074 --> 00:46:06,063
l better go.

668
00:46:06,242 --> 00:46:08,710
Wait! Hold it up so l can listen.

669
00:46:15,951 --> 00:46:18,920
-What we did last night was--
-Stupid.

670
00:46:19,755 --> 00:46:22,087
Totally crazy, stupid.

671
00:46:22,358 --> 00:46:25,020
What were we thinking?

672
00:46:25,227 --> 00:46:27,695
l'm coming over
tonight though, right?

673
00:46:29,899 --> 00:46:30,888
Definitely.

674
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:58,550
Friends, family...

675
00:46:58,794 --> 00:47:00,785
...we are gathered to celebrate...

676
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:03,999
...the joyous union
of Ross and Emily.

677
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:07,259
<i>May the happiness of today...</i>

678
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:08,698
...be with them always.

679
00:47:09,071 --> 00:47:11,096
Now, Emily, repeat after me.

680
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,808
-l, Emily...
-l, Emily...

681
00:47:14,043 --> 00:47:16,273
-...take thee, Ross...
-...take thee, Ross....

682
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:19,448
...as my lawfully wedded husband,
in sickness and in health...

683
00:47:19,682 --> 00:47:21,707
...till death parts us.

684
00:47:22,017 --> 00:47:25,885
As my lawfully wedded husband,
in sickness and in health...

685
00:47:26,155 --> 00:47:28,123
...until death parts us.

686
00:47:28,824 --> 00:47:29,813
Now, Ross.
