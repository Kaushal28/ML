1
00:00:04,316 --> 00:00:05,681
Oh, come on!

2
00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:08,179
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.

3
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:10,878
You know, instead of watching
football, you could help.

4
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:12,386
We know.

5
00:00:13,992 --> 00:00:17,723
Hey, Rachel, you wanna put the
marshmallows in concentric circles.

6
00:00:19,164 --> 00:00:22,156
No, Mon, you want to put
them in concentric circles.

7
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:25,098
l want to do this.

8
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:35,906
Every year.

9
00:00:36,682 --> 00:00:37,808
The One With the Football

10
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:25,359
To the ten, to the five.
Touchdown, Giants!

11
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:31,061
You know, for once l am gonna sit down
and try to watch one of these things.

12
00:01:31,837 --> 00:01:33,361
Halftime.

13
00:01:35,307 --> 00:01:37,070
Who wants to throw
the ball around?

14
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:40,234
-Get a little three-on-three going?
-That would be so much fun.

15
00:01:40,412 --> 00:01:44,007
-Can l play too?
-l've never played football, like, ever.

16
00:01:44,182 --> 00:01:47,049
Great! You can cover Chandler.

17
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:50,016
No, no. l don't really want to play.

18
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:53,649
You never want to do anything
since you and Janice broke up.

19
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:58,125
That's not true. l wanted to wear my
bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day.

20
00:01:58,296 --> 00:02:01,629
l wanted to start drinking in the morning.
Don't say l don't have goals!

21
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:04,828
Chandler, you have to start
getting over her, all right?

22
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:08,666
lf you play, you get some fresh air.
Maybe it'll take your mind off Janice.

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,571
lf you don't play, everyone will be mad
at you because the teams won't be even.

24
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:15,508
-Come on.
-All right, l'll play.

25
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:18,548
But l don't like you.

26
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:22,211
-Let's do it! Ross?
-What?

27
00:02:22,387 --> 00:02:24,287
Wanna play football?

28
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:30,258
Monica and l aren't supposed
to play football.

29
00:02:30,762 --> 00:02:32,855
Says who? Your mom?

30
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:34,888
-Yeah.
-Yes.

31
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:38,736
''What do you mean?''
she asks her boyfriend...

32
00:02:38,904 --> 00:02:41,270
...really scared to hear the answer.

33
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,508
Every Thanksgiving, we used
to have a touch football game...

34
00:02:45,677 --> 00:02:47,372
...called the Geller Bowl.

35
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:49,878
No, no, no. You say that proudly!

36
00:02:50,882 --> 00:02:54,318
Anyway, Ross and l
were always captains.

37
00:02:54,486 --> 00:02:58,081
lt got kind of competitive,
and one year, Geller Bowl Vl...

38
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:01,657
...l accidentally broke Ross' nose.

39
00:03:02,928 --> 00:03:05,055
lt was so not an accident.

40
00:03:05,297 --> 00:03:07,663
She saw l was about to tag her,
so she threw...

41
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,802
...her big fat
grandma-arm elbow in my face...

42
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:12,936
...and just kept running.

43
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:15,096
To score the winning touchdown,
by the way.

44
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:19,806
You did not win the game.
The touchdown didn't count...

45
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:25,005
...because of the spectacularly
illegal, and savage, nose-breaking.

46
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:27,412
l won the game.

47
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:31,487
Oh, yeah? Then how come
you didn't get the Geller Cup?

48
00:03:32,657 --> 00:03:34,591
There was a Geller Cup?

49
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,956
Yes, it was the trophy
you got if you won the game.

50
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,463
But our dad said nobody won that game,
and he was sick of our fighting.

51
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:44,227
So he took the trophy...

52
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:52,205
...threw it in the lake.

53
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:54,969
And was the curse lifted?

54
00:03:56,982 --> 00:03:58,176
Anyway...

55
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:02,147
...that's why Mom said we were
not allowed to play football again.

56
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:05,522
You know what?
l think we should play a game.

57
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,725
l mean, come on.
lt's been 1 2 years.

58
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:09,926
Can l see you for a second?

59
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:18,967
-Wuss!
-All right, we're gonna play.

60
00:04:19,137 --> 00:04:20,661
Wait. How are we gonna get there?

61
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,034
Because my mom
won't let me cross the street.

62
00:04:28,513 --> 00:04:30,606
Pheebs, here you go.

63
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,211
-Okay, let's bring it in.
-Wait.

64
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:34,545
Honey, throw it to me!

65
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:35,708
Here you go.

66
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:41,315
That almost hit me in the face!

67
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:43,324
All right, we have to pick captains.

68
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:45,861
And then Tennilles.

69
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,323
Okay, so how do we decide that?

70
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:51,765
-Well, why don't we just bunny up?
-What?

71
00:04:51,937 --> 00:04:54,337
-Bunny!
-Bunny!

72
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,374
Okay, looks like Ross and l are captains.

73
00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:01,777
There must be a place in heaven for people
who hung out with you in high school.

74
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:06,113
Okay. So l bunnied first,
which means l get to pick first. Joey.

75
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:08,249
-Thank you.
-Monica!

76
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,251
l'm your best friend.

77
00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:15,059
Sweetie, don't worry,
you'll get picked. Chandler.

78
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:18,558
-Ross!
-Phoebe.

79
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,895
Sweetie, now l pick you.

80
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:27,596
You don't pick me.
You're stuck with me!

81
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,807
Okay. All right. So let's see.

82
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:33,069
Let's play from the trash can
to the light post, right?

83
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,801
Two-hand touch. We'll kick off.

84
00:05:35,013 --> 00:05:37,675
All right, people, listen.
l've got exactly 28 minutes...

85
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:39,817
...before l have to baste again.

86
00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:42,111
Wow, just like in the pros.

87
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:44,253
Come on. Huddle up!

88
00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:47,822
-All right, huddle up right over here!
-Wait for me! Wait for me!

89
00:05:48,526 --> 00:05:50,426
Oh, cool! This is my first huddle.

90
00:05:51,396 --> 00:05:52,385
-Okay.
-Okay.

91
00:05:52,564 --> 00:05:55,727
So what do you guys
really think of Chandler?

92
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:59,997
-You know what you're doing, right?
-Yeah.

93
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:01,399
Joey's going to catch it.

94
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:04,337
-And you and l are going to block.
-What's block?

95
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:08,912
-l thought you knew what you were doing.
-l thought you meant in life.

96
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:11,141
Break!

97
00:06:11,316 --> 00:06:15,184
The ball is Janice.
The ball is Janice.

98
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:21,856
Son of a--!

99
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,360
-Come on!
-Sorry. l'm sorry.

100
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:27,191
You know what?
We're just gonna throw it.

101
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,662
l got it!

102
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:31,300
Go, go, go!

103
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:43,742
Score! Seven to nothing!

104
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:46,679
Okay, honey,
just so that l'm clear on this.

105
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:50,787
You said in the huddle that if Joey caught
the ball, you'd be the one to stop him.

106
00:06:50,956 --> 00:06:53,481
Now, you didn't.
So is that like a football strategy?

107
00:06:53,658 --> 00:06:56,957
Yeah, it was part of my plan
to fall instantly behind. So....

108
00:06:57,128 --> 00:06:58,390
Come on. Let's go.

109
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,158
Losers walk.

110
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:03,027
Yeah? Losers talk.

111
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:05,726
No. No. No. Actually, losers rhyme.

112
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:09,205
Forty-three.

113
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:10,500
Seventy-four.

114
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:16,139
-You wanna go shotgun?
-Yeah.

115
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,614
-Hike.
-One Mississippi, two Mississippi....

116
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:22,844
Over here! Over here!

117
00:07:23,755 --> 00:07:24,915
l almost caught that one!

118
00:07:26,524 --> 00:07:29,584
Great. Now the score's
7 to almost 7.

119
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:31,287
Okay.

120
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:34,591
On this play, l want you to do
a down-and-out to the right, okay?

121
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:36,629
-Break!
-Wait. What am l gonna do?

122
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:38,132
You?

123
00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:39,292
You go long.

124
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:40,699
Well, how long?

125
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:43,739
-Until we start to look very small.
-Okay.

126
00:07:43,908 --> 00:07:45,671
Break!

127
00:07:46,277 --> 00:07:48,074
-Hike.
-One Mississippi, two Mississippi--

128
00:07:48,246 --> 00:07:49,736
Switch! Switch! Switch!

129
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:03,020
Hey. Thanks for stopping our ball.

130
00:08:03,194 --> 00:08:05,162
You are playing American football?

131
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,596
Yeah. Wow! You're, like,
from a whole other country!

132
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:11,259
l'm Dutch.

133
00:08:11,436 --> 00:08:13,700
Hi, l'm Joey.

134
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:15,134
l am Margha.

135
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:18,933
l'm sorry, Dutch.
l didn't get that last little bit.

136
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,738
Hey, Joey, you wanna play
football or-- Hi, l'm Chandler.

137
00:08:22,347 --> 00:08:23,746
Hello, Chandler.

138
00:08:24,015 --> 00:08:27,644
Her name is Dutch and also Margha.

139
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:29,008
Margha.

140
00:08:29,187 --> 00:08:31,451
-Margha.
-Margha.

141
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,254
Mar-hon.

142
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:36,482
Margha.

143
00:08:36,661 --> 00:08:40,791
Yo, flirty boys.
We're in the middle of a game.

144
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:43,456
Come on, guys! Let's go!
Come on. Second down!

145
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:47,463
-Hello? lt's third down.
-No, it's not. lt's second.

146
00:08:48,573 --> 00:08:50,598
-Wow.
-Wow what?

147
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:54,777
How it just amazes me
that you're still pulling stuff like this.

148
00:08:55,313 --> 00:08:59,147
-Pulling what? lt's second down.
-Okay, it's second down.

149
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:01,746
Take all the second downs you need.

150
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:05,249
-l heard that.
-Well, l said it loud.

151
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:09,322
lt is okay if l stay and watch?

152
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:10,984
l can't go home just yet.

153
00:09:11,162 --> 00:09:16,600
My roommate is forshlocking
a big American businessman.

154
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:20,795
-Just sit right there.
-Yeah, why don't you stick around?

155
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:22,599
-Well, that went well.
-l think so.

156
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:25,775
You know, l was thinking
about asking her for her number.

157
00:09:26,044 --> 00:09:30,777
Thanks, man, but it makes a stronger
statement if l ask for it myself, you know?

158
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,640
No. l was thinking about for me.

159
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:36,810
As part of that whole getting-over-Janice
thing you talked about.

160
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:38,752
Oh, yeah. That.

161
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:41,783
lf it means that much,
l'll let you have her.

162
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,655
Thanks.

163
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:46,724
Let me have her?

164
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:49,492
What do you mean?
lf you didn't, l wouldn't have a shot?

165
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:52,593
l don't like to say it out loud...

166
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:54,295
...but yeah!

167
00:09:55,507 --> 00:09:57,771
Don't feel bad, man.
We all have our strengths.

168
00:09:57,942 --> 00:10:02,572
-You're better with numbers and stuff.
-Math? You're giving me math?

169
00:10:03,848 --> 00:10:05,975
All right, you know what?
Forget about it.

170
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:08,617
You go for the girl.
We'll see who gets her.

171
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,923
Chandler, l want you to run
a post-pattern to the left. And, sweetie--

172
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:17,355
Yeah, l know. Go long.

173
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:21,292
You know, it's like all l'm doing is
running back and forth from the huddle.

174
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:25,528
Well, you wanna just stay out there?

175
00:10:26,404 --> 00:10:28,531
Can l see that for a second?

176
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:33,540
-Okay.
-Okay, let's go.

177
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:35,006
-l got Chandler!
-Hike!

178
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,181
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi.

179
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:39,645
Fumble!

180
00:10:45,623 --> 00:10:48,558
What the hell's the matter with you?
This is my favorite jersey.

181
00:10:49,294 --> 00:10:51,524
Well, now you have two.

182
00:10:52,797 --> 00:10:55,357
Hey, l am good at math!

183
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:57,728
That's it. l was still
gonna let you have her.

184
00:10:57,902 --> 00:11:00,700
But now forget about it.
Prepare to feel bad about yourself.

185
00:11:00,872 --> 00:11:04,239
Hey, well, l've been preparing
for that my entire life!

186
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:07,104
Or something about you that's mean!

187
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:09,508
All right. Come on, guys. Let's go.

188
00:11:09,747 --> 00:11:11,544
Tie score.
We're running out of time.

189
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,143
Forty-two, 38, hike!

190
00:11:14,352 --> 00:11:15,376
l got it!

191
00:11:16,421 --> 00:11:19,117
Oh, broken boobs!

192
00:11:19,757 --> 00:11:21,657
-Pheebs, run!
-Run, Phoebe, run!

193
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,423
Touchdown! Touchdown!

194
00:11:28,566 --> 00:11:30,761
Hello, the buzzer buzzed.
lt doesn't count.

195
00:11:31,236 --> 00:11:32,931
-After the snap.
-Before the snap.

196
00:11:33,238 --> 00:11:34,432
-After.
-Before.

197
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:36,401
-Now, does it really matter?
-Yes!

198
00:11:36,674 --> 00:11:40,201
But l made a touchdown.
lt was my first touchdown.

199
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:42,846
Pheebs, that's great.
Doesn't count.

200
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:45,945
-Does so count.
-Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.

201
00:11:47,752 --> 00:11:50,186
Oh, my God!

202
00:11:50,755 --> 00:11:54,589
You know what? That's fine.
Maybe you haven't grown up, but l have.

203
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:57,887
-Oh, okay.
-Dead leg!

204
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:02,097
Okay, fine. You want to win
by cheating, go ahead, all right.

205
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:04,326
Phoebe, the touchdown
does count. You win.

206
00:12:05,203 --> 00:12:06,795
No!

207
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:09,731
l'm not going
to go through this again.

208
00:12:09,907 --> 00:12:11,841
l wanna beat you
when you can't blame...

209
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,639
...it on the broken nose or the buzzer
or the fact that you might have mono.

210
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:19,273
All right. Let's just call
this tie score and it's halftime.

211
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,145
First, l don't play with cheaters.

212
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:24,220
And second of all,
you know l had swollen glands!

213
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,522
You know what? l think you'll play.

214
00:12:29,327 --> 00:12:30,919
Oh, really? Why's that?

215
00:12:31,095 --> 00:12:32,960
Because the winner gets this.

216
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:35,759
The Geller Cup!

217
00:12:38,202 --> 00:12:42,696
ls everybody else seeing a
troll doll nailed to a two-by-four?

218
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:44,967
Okay, good.

219
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:49,843
Okay, where the hell did you get that?

220
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:52,344
When you went to the hospital
for your nose...

221
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,448
...l swam into the lake
and fished it out.

222
00:12:55,653 --> 00:12:56,677
That cup is mine!

223
00:12:56,854 --> 00:13:00,085
No, it's not. You want it,
you're gonna have to win it.

224
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,385
All right. So are we not
having dinner at all?

225
00:13:04,062 --> 00:13:06,622
Hey, could you please
set the timer, Margha?

226
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:08,732
Okay, Beefy.

227
00:13:11,602 --> 00:13:15,470
Come on, Phoebe, let's go. Come on,
it's time to get serious. Huddle up.

228
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,671
Joey, keep your head in the game.

229
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:21,309
lt's hard, you know?
His huddle's close to the Dutch girl.

230
00:13:22,647 --> 00:13:26,276
Look, if l take Chandler out of the
running, will you be able to focus?

231
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:29,249
-What are you gonna do?
-Just make sure he catches the ball.

232
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,580
-l'll do the rest.
-Okay.

233
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:33,456
-Come on, you wuss!
-Okay, come on.

234
00:13:34,492 --> 00:13:36,323
-Go, Chan--
-l got it!

235
00:13:36,494 --> 00:13:37,483
Come on! This way!

236
00:13:37,662 --> 00:13:38,651
Hi!

237
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:39,952
Look out!

238
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:47,262
Tackled by a girl! Bet you don't
see that every day, do you?

239
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,939
What's with the tackling?

240
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:52,398
What?

241
00:13:52,944 --> 00:13:54,844
l just touched him and he went over.

242
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:59,004
Okay. You wanna play rough?
We can play rough.

243
00:13:59,684 --> 00:14:02,118
Let's get ready to rumble!

244
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:44,257
-Go, go, go!
-Get her! Get her!

245
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,895
l love this game!

246
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:54,234
Hey, where'd you get that?

247
00:14:54,972 --> 00:14:56,837
l went really long.

248
00:14:58,176 --> 00:15:00,041
Forty-two to 21 .

249
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:03,305
Like the turkey, Ross is done!

250
00:15:04,282 --> 00:15:07,479
No surprise. You got to pick first,
so you got the better team.

251
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:10,587
You're pathetic! Why can't you
just accept that we're winning...

252
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:12,188
...because l'm better than you?

253
00:15:12,857 --> 00:15:16,258
Oh, what a great argument.
Exhaling!

254
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:18,759
You know what? l'll prove it to you.

255
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,825
l'll trade you Joey for Rachel
and l'll still win the game.

256
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,561
Oh, that's great.
There goes my last shred of self-esteem.

257
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:30,204
What? The guys against the girls?

258
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:33,969
See that's ridiculous, Monica, because
l'm only down by three touchdowns.

259
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:35,806
Oh, then bring it on!

260
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:39,312
Unless, of course, you're afraid
you might lose to a bunch of girls.

261
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:44,953
Fine. Fine. Rachel, you're with Monica.
Joey, you're with me.

262
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:47,953
l cannot believe you are trading me.

263
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,888
You are going to lose.

264
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:52,723
And you are going to lose.

265
00:15:52,897 --> 00:15:54,296
And....

266
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:56,433
Help me out.
l've never done this before.

267
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:57,590
That's good. Lose.

268
00:15:57,768 --> 00:15:58,962
Lose!

269
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:03,839
Come on. Let's see what it's like
to be on a winning team for a change.

270
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:05,669
You're gonna let me play?

271
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,010
All right, then!

272
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:10,243
The game is over? We eat now?

273
00:16:10,414 --> 00:16:12,405
The game's not over.
We're switching teams.

274
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:16,849
Yeah. Chandler finds me so intimidating
that it's better if we're on the same team.

275
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:19,253
All right. Okay, let's play. Let's go.

276
00:16:19,423 --> 00:16:20,685
Hold on a second, Joe.

277
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,420
Where do Dutch people come from?

278
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:36,263
Well, the Pennsylvania Dutch
come from Pennsylvania.

279
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:38,899
And the other Dutch people?

280
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:41,770
They come from somewhere near
the Netherlands, right?

281
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:43,914
Nice try.

282
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:46,481
See the Netherlands
is this make-believe place...

283
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:49,677
...where Peter Pan
and Tinker Bell come from.

284
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:52,488
Oh, my.

285
00:16:52,657 --> 00:16:56,218
Enough with geography for
the insane, okay. Let's play some ball.

286
00:16:56,427 --> 00:16:59,863
-No. l'm not playing with this guy now.
-Fine with me.

287
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:03,057
Okay, l've had enough of this.
Let's just cut to the chase.

288
00:17:03,301 --> 00:17:05,428
Heidi, which
of my boys do you like?

289
00:17:06,437 --> 00:17:07,426
What are you doing?

290
00:17:07,705 --> 00:17:09,935
What are you doing?

291
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:12,435
Which do l like?

292
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,478
Yeah, for dating, general merriment,
taking back to your windmill?

293
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:19,582
Well, if l had to choose right now...

294
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,480
...which, by the way,
l find really weird...

295
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:25,981
...l would have to say Chandler.

296
00:17:26,357 --> 00:17:28,188
Yes!

297
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,892
Wait a minute. She obviously
didn't understand the question.

298
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:35,328
Well, why don't you have
Captain Hook explain it to her?

299
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:38,626
l'm sorry, Joey. That is my truth.

300
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:42,430
You hear that? That is her truth,
Mr. l'll-Let-You-Have-Her!

301
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:45,337
l win! You suck! l rule all!

302
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,669
Mini-wave in celebration of me!

303
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:57,146
l am now thinking l would like
to change my answer to no one.

304
00:17:57,688 --> 00:17:59,519
What?

305
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,090
l now find you shallow...

306
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,487
...and a dork.

307
00:18:04,662 --> 00:18:06,425
Bye-bye.

308
00:18:07,498 --> 00:18:11,025
Nice going. You just saved
yourself a couple months of sex.

309
00:18:11,936 --> 00:18:15,030
You know what? lt doesn't matter,
because she picked me. Me!

310
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:16,298
Now l get the dates...

311
00:18:16,474 --> 00:18:20,274
...and you stay home on Saturday
nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!

312
00:18:20,878 --> 00:18:23,642
Save the breakthroughs for therapy.
The clock is ticking.

313
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:26,577
We have no time
and we are losing to girls.

314
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:28,378
We're not gonna lose to girls.

315
00:18:28,552 --> 00:18:29,985
lt's 42 to 21 !

316
00:18:30,221 --> 00:18:33,918
This sucks!
l was just up by that much!

317
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:36,916
Look, let me put it this way.

318
00:18:37,094 --> 00:18:39,528
lf we lose, they will never let us forget it.

319
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:43,633
Okay, and worse than that, they'll never
let the women you date forget it.

320
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:47,134
Hey! Are we playing football, or what?
Come on, you hairy-backed Marys!

321
00:18:48,973 --> 00:18:52,067
We have to do this.
We are playing for women everywhere.

322
00:18:52,243 --> 00:18:54,803
Okay, just think about
every lousy date you ever had.

323
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,980
Every guy who kept one eye
on the TV while you were making out.

324
00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:01,380
Oh, my God! You dated
someone with a glass eye too?

325
00:19:02,987 --> 00:19:07,185
Come on, okay? This is for
all womankind. Let's kill them!

326
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:09,553
Yeah! Kill them!

327
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:12,627
All right, well,
l want to kill them too.

328
00:19:12,797 --> 00:19:14,162
But they're boys.

329
00:19:14,598 --> 00:19:17,965
You know, how are we gonna
beat three boys?

330
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:50,364
We still have a minute and a half
left, and we're down by two points.

331
00:19:50,534 --> 00:19:51,831
Two points, ladies.

332
00:19:57,241 --> 00:19:59,471
Phoebe, you do a buttonhook again.

333
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,143
Rachel, you go long.

334
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:05,043
No, don't make me go long.
Use me. They never cover me.

335
00:20:05,216 --> 00:20:06,979
Honey, there's a reason.

336
00:20:08,252 --> 00:20:11,585
Monica, l'm not lame, okay?
l can do something. l can throw.

337
00:20:11,756 --> 00:20:15,522
-Let me throw. This is my game too.
-Come on, Mon. Let her throw the ball.

338
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:19,457
Rachel, sweep behind, l'll pitch it to you.
You throw it downfield to Phoebe.

339
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,619
Thank you.

340
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:21,787
-Break!
-Break!

341
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:23,996
-All right, here we go.
-Okay.

342
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:26,567
Thirty-two, 7 1 , hike!

343
00:20:26,771 --> 00:20:29,331
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi!

344
00:20:34,578 --> 00:20:36,102
Go, go, go!

345
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:39,042
Mon, catch!

346
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:44,078
-l'm so sorry. Are you okay?
-No, l'm not okay!

347
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:47,890
l'm sorry. They were coming at me
and l didn't know what to do.

348
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:50,117
Thirty seconds left on the timer.

349
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:53,859
You are the loser!

350
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,658
Okay, okay. So we get
to take that stupid troll thing home.

351
00:20:58,836 --> 00:21:01,805
Come on! Come on! Hurry!
We're running out of time.

352
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:04,634
-Huddle up!
-Okay.

353
00:21:05,976 --> 00:21:07,944
Oh, this is our last huddle!

354
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:11,747
All right, Phoebe, get open.
Rachel...

355
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:12,905
...go long.

356
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,414
Okay.

357
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:16,517
Break!

358
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:06,398
l did it! Touchdown!
We did it!

359
00:22:09,974 --> 00:22:14,308
You know? Rachel, funny thing, actually.
The end zone starts at that pole.

360
00:22:14,545 --> 00:22:16,570
So you're 5 feet short.
So...

361
00:22:17,581 --> 00:22:19,481
...we win!

362
00:22:20,684 --> 00:22:22,208
Yes, yes, yes!

363
00:22:22,386 --> 00:22:24,377
Wait, so explain
something to me, though.

364
00:22:24,655 --> 00:22:28,853
lf nobody tagged Rachel,
then isn't the play still going?

365
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:36,622
-Let me in, let me in!
-No way! Let go!

366
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,065
Let go?! l'm a tiny little woman!

367
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:44,537
Guys, guys, come on. lt's Thanksgiving!
lt's not important who wins or loses.

368
00:22:44,775 --> 00:22:47,903
The important thing
is, the Dutch girl picked me!

369
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,049
Me, not you! Holland loves Chandler!
Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!

370
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:01,850
We should definitely
play football more often.

371
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:04,893
Maybe there's, like, a league
we could join or something.

372
00:23:05,062 --> 00:23:07,963
lsn't there, like,
a national football league?

373
00:23:08,832 --> 00:23:11,665
Yes. Yes, there is. They play
on Sundays and Monday nights.

374
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:14,429
Oh, shoot! l work Monday nights.

375
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,566
This stuffing is amazing.

376
00:23:19,743 --> 00:23:23,235
-Should we should bring them some?
-When they're hungry, they'll come in.

377
00:23:23,414 --> 00:23:26,315
-Let go!
-No, you let go!

378
00:23:28,218 --> 00:23:31,187
How come it's always us
left on the field, holding the ball?

379
00:23:31,488 --> 00:23:35,788
l don't know. l guess the other
people just don't care enough.

380
00:23:40,898 --> 00:23:44,459
Hey, it's starting to snow.

381
00:23:48,238 --> 00:23:51,935
-Give it to me! Let go!
-Let it go! Come on!

382
00:23:56,013 --> 00:23:59,244
There was a time tonight that
l started losing the feeling in my toes.

383
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,350
-l know.
-That's when l realized...

384
00:24:01,518 --> 00:24:04,681
...there's more important things
than beating you at football.

385
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:06,652
Things like feet.

386
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:10,453
Yeah, l know. This thing has
caused us too much pain and suffering.

387
00:24:10,627 --> 00:24:12,254
-Yeah.
-lt's time.

388
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:14,124
We'll just call it a tie.

389
00:24:14,298 --> 00:24:16,528
-lt's a tie.
-All right.

390
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,689
Here.

391
00:24:19,036 --> 00:24:20,367
Okay.

392
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:27,508
-Good night.
-Good night.

393
00:24:29,847 --> 00:24:31,075
Pheebs, did you get it?

394
00:24:31,248 --> 00:24:33,478
-Yeah, l got it.
-Oh, great.

395
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:38,349
Bring it up. There's champagne
in my apartment for the winners.

396
00:24:38,522 --> 00:24:41,958
-Ross! What are you doing down here?
-Nothing.

397
00:24:45,629 --> 00:24:46,618
