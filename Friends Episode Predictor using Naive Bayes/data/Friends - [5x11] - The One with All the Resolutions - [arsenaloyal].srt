1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:03,758
Any entertainment there?

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:08,565
All right. Here we go!
1999, the year of Joey.

3
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:10,333
We're very happy for you.

4
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:11,703
What's the matter?

5
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:15,540
We wanted to kiss at midnight,
but nobody else will, so....

6
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:18,411
All right, I'll take care of it.

7
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:21,186
It's 30 seconds to midnight,
what are you gonna do?

8
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,982
Will you just trust me?

9
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,523
Thirty-three, 32, 31

10
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,556
Who are you kissing at midnight?
Rachel or Phoebe?

11
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,086
You can't kiss your sister.

12
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,524
-Who's gonna kiss my sister?
-Chandler.

13
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:34,722
Oh, man! Really?

14
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,902
Would you rather
have me or him kiss her?

15
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,399
That's a good point.

16
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:42,096
Since I have that whole history
with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.

17
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,906
Phoebe! Listen.
Ross wants to kiss you at midnight.

18
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,911
So obvious.
Why doesn't he just ask?

19
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,074
-Rach! I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
-What?

20
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,618
You can't kiss Ross.
You got the history.

21
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:56,982
So?

22
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,784
-Would you prefer me or Chandler?
-Good point.

23
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,554
Three, two, one!

24
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,128
Happy New Year!

25
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,663
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,467
-Happy New Year.
-You too.

27
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:16,903
Happy New Year, Joey.

28
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,275
So that do anything for you?

29
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,681
The One with
All the Resolutions

30
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,486
You know what?

31
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:13,858
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say "No divorces in '99!"

32
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,360
But your divorce isn't final yet.

33
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,131
Just the one divorce in '99!

34
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:27,539
I am gonna be happy this year.
I am gonna make myself happy.

35
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,873
Do you want us to leave the room?

36
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:35,015
Every day I am gonna do one thing
I have never done before.

37
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,381
That is my New Year's resolution.

38
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,788
That's a good one!

39
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,859
Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.

40
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,690
Now you only have to find
a planeload of people...

41
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,063
...whose resolution is
to plummet to their deaths.

42
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,372
Maybe your resolution should be
not to make fun of your friends.

43
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:58,340
Especially the ones who might
fly you to Europe for free.

44
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:01,646
She has a better chance
of flying up your nose...

45
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,316
...than you do of
not making fun of us.

46
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,920
I'll bet $50 you can't go the year
without making fun of us.

47
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,554
Better yet, a week.

48
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,486
I'll take that bet, my friend.

49
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,750
Paying me the $50 can be...

50
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,519
...the "new thing you do" that day.

51
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,223
And it starts right now!

52
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:26,601
My New Year's resolution is
to learn how to play guitar.

53
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,238
Really? How come?

54
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:32,036
You know those special skills
I have listed on my resume?

55
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,941
I would love it
if one of those was true.

56
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,076
Want me to teach you?
I'm great.

57
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,911
Really?
Who have you taught?

58
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,677
Well, I taught me. And I loved me.

59
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,856
That'd be great!
Yeah, thanks, Phoebe.

60
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:49,728
My resolution is to be less obsessed
with being neat and clean.

61
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,227
Really?

62
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,262
Or something else.

63
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,034
Look. Blaire forgot her glasses.

64
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,077
She'll need these to keep an eye
on that boyfriend.

65
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,738
Who, from what I hear,
needs to keep his stapler...

66
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,147
...in his desk drawer,
if you know what I mean!

67
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:18,114
Maybe your resolution
should be to gossip less.

68
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,258
What? I don't gossip.

69
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,223
Maybe sometimes I find out things.

70
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,957
Or I hear something
and I pass that information on.

71
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,932
You know, kind of
like a public service.

72
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:35,470
It doesn't mean I'm a gossip.
Is Ted Koppel a gossip?

73
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:40,078
If Ted Koppel talked about his
coworkers' botched boob jobs, I would.

74
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,074
They were like this!

75
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:49,578
Fine, my New Year's resolution
will be not to gossip.

76
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,919
-It's easy.
-Easy? You have never kept a resolution.

77
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:56,127
-Yes, I have.
-Okay, let's see how you did last year.

78
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,356
No. No. Not my diary.
You cannot read my diary.

79
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,466
"Dear diary: I'm so excited.

80
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:07,265
My resolution is to write in you every day.
See you tomorrow."

81
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,635
Nothing.

82
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,571
You know, not a lot happened last year.

83
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:19,375
All right, I will prove to you that I can keep it
this time. No more gossiping.

84
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,580
I hate gossip. In junior high this girl
said a lot of mean stuff about me...

85
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,520
...and I set her bike on fire.

86
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,094
-Wow, what did she say about you?
-She said I was crazy.

87
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:32,129
But I guess she got hers.

88
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:40,364
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

89
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,334
I just asked that girl out.

90
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,204
Nice!

91
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,039
Is that part of
your "new thing" for today?

92
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,182
Yes, it is. See?

93
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,678
"Elizabeth...

94
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,211
...Hornswoggle"?

95
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,087
That's right.

96
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,660
Elizabeth Hornswoggle.

97
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,925
You okay, Chandler?

98
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,694
Something funny about that name?

99
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:15,434
No, I just think
I've heard it somewhere before.

100
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,073
Oh, really? Where?

101
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,382
Somewhere funny, I'll bet.

102
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,313
Guess what.

103
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,115
I have a date
with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.

104
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,754
Oh, this must be killing you!

105
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,194
All right, see you later.

106
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,227
Not really.

107
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:45,826
-I haven't told you her middle name yet.
-Well, don't. Just don't.

108
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,701
-See you later.
-See you.

109
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,071
All right, Phoebe,
I am ready for my first lesson.

110
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,941
No, you don't touch the guitar.

111
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,945
First you learn here, then here.

112
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,754
Lesson one: Chords.

113
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,753
Now, I don't know
the actual names of the chords.

114
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:13,161
But I made up names for the way
my hand looks while I'm doing them.

115
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,632
So then this is "Bear Claw."

116
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,196
"Turkey Leg"...

117
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,772
...and "Old Lady."

118
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,977
What an interesting approach
to guitar instruction.

119
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:36,178
You know, some might find it amusing.
I myself find it regular.

120
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:40,681
Hey, everybody!

121
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,694
Rachel was so good today.
She didn't gossip at all.

122
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,456
I didn't.
Even when I found out

123
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,725
Let's say I found out
something about someone...

124
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,402
...and let's just say...

125
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,298
...she's gonna keep it.

126
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,708
Check this out.

127
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,740
You nailed the Old Lady!

128
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:15,153
I thought I was getting better,
so I stopped by this guitar store

129
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,363
Did you touch
any of the guitars there?

130
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,423
Did you?

131
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,158
No.

132
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,929
Give me your hands.

133
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,840
Strings.

134
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,502
Pick.

135
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:38,411
-Do you want to learn to play guitar?
-Yes.

136
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,846
Then don't touch one!

137
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,724
-Hi, Ben.
-Auntie Monica!

138
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,195
Ross is wearing leather pants!

139
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,933
Does nobody else see
Ross is wearing leather pants?

140
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,300
Someone comment on the pants!

141
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:06,276
-I think they're very nice.
-I really like them a lot.

142
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,874
Not what I had in mind.

143
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,745
People like Ross don't wear
these types of pants.

144
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,284
You see, they're very tight.

145
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,414
Maybe there's something in that area?

146
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,553
I think they look really good.

147
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,421
Where'd you get them?

148
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,758
I needed a new thing for today.

149
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,492
There's this leather store
that always smells so good.

150
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:35,104
And I thought to myself:
"Wow. I've never owned...

151
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:39,642
...a really good-smelling
pair of pants before."

152
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,280
Oh, come on!

153
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,778
What do you think?

154
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,149
You look like a freak.

155
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,346
Awful!

156
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,652
What are you doing?

157
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:01,321
-It's my New Year's resolution.
-To blind my child?

158
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,126
To take pictures of us together.

159
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,067
It's the best resolution.
Everyone can enjoy them.

160
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,673
Everyone will enjoy my music as well.

161
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:25,789
My God, these pants!
I'm burning up.

162
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:32,187
Oh God! She wants to snuggle now?
Is she trying to kill me?

163
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,525
It's like a volcano in here!

164
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:39,331
-Are you hot?
-No.

165
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,996
It must just be me, then.

166
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,084
That was just the pants
and the couch.

167
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,987
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?

168
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,390
-Go ahead.
-Thanks.

169
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,139
My favorite part's coming up!

170
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,717
Oh, my God!

171
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:12,486
Tiger.

172
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:13,655
Dragon.

173
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,597
Iceberg!

174
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:19,234
Joseph, did you even study
at all last night?

175
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:20,836
Yes, I did!

176
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,267
Then do lceberg.

177
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:24,665
G-sharp.

178
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,275
G-sharp?

179
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,643
Have you been studying
the real names of the chords?

180
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,240
Have you?

181
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,077
Oh, my God!

182
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,313
What? I didn't touch a guitar!

183
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,253
But you're questioning my method!

184
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,622
No, I'm not questioning it.
I'm saying it's stupid!

185
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,419
What?

186
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,027
Thank you.

187
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,961
You know, none of my other student...

188
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,867
...thought I was stupid.

189
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,205
Your other student was you!

190
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:03,671
Well, maybe you just need
to try a little harder!

191
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,181
Maybe I need to try a real teacher!

192
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,649
Here! Andy Cooper.
He teaches guitar.

193
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,152
There's a picture of him with a kid.

194
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,848
And the kid's got a guitar!

195
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,784
Fine!

196
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,691
You learn from
your "qualified instructor."

197
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,525
But don't come crying
when everyone is sick...

198
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,704
...of hearing you play
"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"!

199
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,966
Oh, fine. Take his side!

200
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,715
I can't wait to be with you.

201
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,045
I'll sneak over as soon as I can.

202
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,746
I'll tell Rachel
I'll be doing laundry.

203
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,085
Laundry.
Is that my new nickname?

204
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,330
You know what your nickname is,
Mr. Big

205
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:12,146
Would you stop looking at me like that?
Phoebe was a terrible teacher.

206
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,309
I wasn't learning anything from her

207
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,945
Look I feel bad, too
Forget it, we're going around in circles.

208
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,523
Joey, it's Ross.
I need some help.

209
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,693
Chandler's not here.

210
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,391
You can help me.

211
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,739
I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom.

212
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,567
Nice!

213
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,868
No, I got really hot in my pants,
so I took them off.

214
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:45,048
But they must have shrunk
from the sweat.

215
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:48,548
Or my legs expanded from the heat.

216
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:53,349
I can't get them back on, Joey.
I can't!

217
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,759
That is quite a situation.

218
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,390
Do you see any powder?

219
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,396
Powder! Yeah, I have powder.

220
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,069
Good, good.

221
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,604
Sprinkle some on.
It'll absorb moisture.

222
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,502
Then you can get your pants on.

223
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,404
Yeah, hold on.

224
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,368
They're not coming on, man.

225
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:44,203
Okay, cut slits in the pants, right?
Then put them back on...

226
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:48,074
...go out there
and tell her you're the lncredible Hulk.

227
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,183
Chandler's not there?

228
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,979
That would have worked,
but all right, fine.

229
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,918
You see any....
Oh, Vaseline?

230
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,862
I see lotion. I have lotion.
Will that work?

231
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,361
Sure, throw some of that on there.

232
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,487
Hold on.

233
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,750
Sounds like it's working.

234
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,581
They're still not coming on, man.

235
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:37,284
And the lotion and the powder
have made a paste.

236
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,389
Really.

237
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,556
What color is it?

238
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,364
What difference does that make?

239
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:50,097
If the paste matches the pants,
you can make paste pants...

240
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,867
...and she won't know!

241
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,274
Do you have a minute?

242
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,914
Dude, what am l

243
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:00,142
Rachel's here, so good luck.
Let me know how it goes.

244
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,155
Joey, I have such a problem.

245
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,358
Your timing couldn't be better.

246
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,255
I'm putting out fires
all over the place.

247
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,965
I have got to tell you something.

248
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,293
What is it?

249
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,903
It's so huge! But promise me.
You cannot tell anyone.

250
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,403
No, no, no!
I don't want to know.

251
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,836
You do want to know.
This is unbelievable!

252
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:29,444
I'm tired of being the guy
who knows all the secrets...

253
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,138
...and can't tell anyone.

254
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,816
You know secrets?

255
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,645
You're not supposed to gossip!

256
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,583
I can't keep this in.
So I pick up the phone

257
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,693
I'm not listening to you!

258
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,349
You've been in there for a long time.

259
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,177
I'm starting to get
kind of freaked out.

260
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,981
All right, I'm coming out.

261
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,718
Hey, can you turn the lights off?

262
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,559
Let's just leave the lights on.

263
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,468
Oh, my God!

264
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,545
I had a problem.

265
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:47,023
I can't talk to you. I don't have
a fancy ad in the yellow pages.

266
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:56,827
I want to apologize for saying
your method was stupid.

267
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,530
And maybe ask you
to be my teacher again?

268
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:05,504
I promise, I won't touch a guitar
until you say I'm ready.

269
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,615
You really think I'm ready?

270
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,258
Wow, cool!

271
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,810
-Was the chord at least right before
-No.

272
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,314
Oh, my God!

273
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,561
We heard about your pants.
I'm so sorry.

274
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,560
This year was supposed to be great.

275
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,264
It's only the second day
and I'm a loser...

276
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,563
...with stupid leather pants
that don't even fit!

277
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,904
You're not a loser.

278
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,340
Look at me!

279
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,309
Hey, look!

280
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,589
Ben drew a picture of you.

281
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,917
You're a cowboy.

282
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,697
Because of the leather pants?

283
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:39,765
He thinks you're a cowboy,
not a loser. That's something.

284
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,998
-lt really is something.
-Howdy, partner.

285
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,144
Maybe I should get another pair.

286
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,871
You know, they had some...

287
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:53,276
...with fringe all down the sides.

288
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,880
Phoebe, you may know this.
You know strange things.

289
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:01,049
What is the boiling point of brain?

290
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,488
I used to know this.

291
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,063
I'm gonna go kiss Ben good night.

292
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,304
I can't believe he thinks
I'm a cowboy.

293
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,637
I would make a good cowboy.

294
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:26,782
Now that everything's wrapped up,
I'll do my laundry.

295
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,783
Yeah, me too.
If this shirt is dirty.

296
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,322
I'm going to the airport.

297
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:41,088
If I hang around there
long enough...

298
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,565
...someone's bound to leave
a plane unattended.

299
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,270
-Good luck, honey.
-Bye.

300
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:55,069
Remember that thing
I was gonna tell you about?

301
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:02,312
I won't tell you.
But if you found out on your own...

302
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:05,420
...that would be okay
and we could talk about it.

303
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,457
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret.
So that would be okay.

304
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,094
Would you mind going
into Chandler's bedroom...

305
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,361
...and getting that book
he borrowed from me?

306
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,941
Now? You want me
to go over there now?

307
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,811
-Do you know something?
-Do you?

308
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,607
-I might know something.
-I might too.

309
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,718
-What do you know?
-You tell me first.

310
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,445
-I can't.
-Then I can't.

311
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:39,851
Okay, fine.

312
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:50,724
You don't know.

313
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,837
I'll walk into his bedroom
and see the thing...

314
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,372
...I think I know is actually
the thing I think I know!

315
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,968
-You know!
-And you know!

316
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,236
Yeah, I know!

317
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,381
Chandler and Monica?
Oh, this is unbelievable!

318
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,879
-How long have you known?
-Too long!

319
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:10,179
I've been dying to talk
to someone about this!

320
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,348
You can't say anything to anybody.
They're so weird about that.

321
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,187
It's raining.

322
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,730
I don't like to fly in the rain.

323
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,196
I am gonna go for a walk
in the rain.

324
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,566
Me too.

325
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,278
That's weird.

326
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,844
I bet they're doing it.

327
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,653
Okay, look.
I can't take it anymore.

328
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,883
So you win. Okay?
Here.

329
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,824
Flying a jet?
Make it a spaceship...

330
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,328
...so you can get back
to your home planet!

331
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:59,525
Phone call for you. Tom Jones.
He wants his pants back!

332
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:05,002
And Hornswoggle? What, are you dating
a character from Fraggle Rock?
