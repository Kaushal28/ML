1
00:00:10,122 --> 00:00:13,922
'Cause every time I see your face

2
00:00:14,526 --> 00:00:18,121
I can't help but fall from grace

3
00:00:18,363 --> 00:00:19,853
This girl's good.

4
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:23,864
Yeah, a song with rhyming words!
l never thought of that before.

5
00:00:26,204 --> 00:00:27,193
l like her.

6
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,705
Why? Because she can both sing
and play guitar at the same time?

7
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:35,475
That's all l'm looking for
from these people.

8
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:38,249
Look at you, all jealous.

9
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:41,714
Come on, Pheebs. You two have
completely different styles.

10
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:44,582
She's more....
You know?

11
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,781
And you're more....

12
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:52,788
Say you'll stay beside me

13
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,966
See? Everybody else is
happy she's done.

14
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:05,474
Okay, my next song's called:

15
00:01:05,744 --> 00:01:08,804
''Phoebe Buffay, What Can l Say?
l Loved When We Were...

16
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:12,346
...Singing Partners and l Shouldn't
Have Left You That Way.''

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,312
One of those ''look for
the hidden meaning'' songs.

18
00:01:22,227 --> 00:01:24,127
The One With Phoebe's Ex-Partner

19
00:02:08,206 --> 00:02:09,730
Hey, Phoebe.

20
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:11,034
Hey, Leslie.

21
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:12,676
How'd you know l'd be here?

22
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:15,744
l saw Vlad at the place
where they sell the big fish.

23
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:17,710
He said you played here a lot, so....

24
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,608
l have to go to the bathroom.

25
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:21,842
lf ''big-fish place''
comes up again...

26
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:26,115
...l'd like to know if that's several
big fish or just one big fish.

27
00:02:27,392 --> 00:02:29,292
So Phoebe says you write jingles.

28
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:32,359
Actually, l said she abandoned me
to write jingles.

29
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:36,093
Anything we might've heard of?

30
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:40,496
Home is never far away

31
00:02:40,706 --> 00:02:44,904
Home is Homestar Stew.

32
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:49,112
But l don't do that anymore.
l got kind of sick of it.

33
00:02:49,448 --> 00:02:53,942
And then l couldn't come up with
anything good, so they fired me.

34
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:55,277
Bummer.

35
00:02:56,955 --> 00:02:59,389
Well, you know, l was just....

36
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:03,025
l was just thinking
and just hoping that...

37
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:06,327
...maybe you'd want
to get back together?

38
00:03:07,032 --> 00:03:08,363
No, but, thanks.

39
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:10,967
Come on, Phoebe.
Would you just think about it?

40
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,206
No, but, thanks.

41
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:22,713
See you, Pheebs.

42
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:28,147
That was kind of brutal.

43
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:31,052
Let this be a lesson to all of you.

44
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:34,656
Once you betray me,
l become like the lce Woman.

45
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,763
l'm just very cold, hard, unyielding.

46
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:43,423
You know, nothing can
penetrate this icy exterior.

47
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:45,000
Can l have a tissue?

48
00:03:51,943 --> 00:03:53,535
ls someone in there?

49
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:56,908
l'm playing a daredevil game...

50
00:03:57,182 --> 00:04:00,583
...called ''Wait Until the Last Moment
Before l Burst and Die.''

51
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:02,552
Jeez, man! Did you fall--?

52
00:04:02,754 --> 00:04:03,743
Hi!

53
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:07,858
So did you?
Did you fall high?

54
00:04:08,994 --> 00:04:11,087
Someone was in the ladies' room.
l couldn't wait.

55
00:04:11,363 --> 00:04:13,422
l left the lid up for you, though.

56
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:17,759
You know what, Gunther?
Go ahead.

57
00:04:18,036 --> 00:04:20,027
l'm talking to....

58
00:04:21,907 --> 00:04:23,670
This is where you say your name.

59
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:24,866
Ginger.

60
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:27,510
Ginger.
l'm talking to Ginger, so....

61
00:04:31,116 --> 00:04:33,209
Don't you have to use the bathroom?

62
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:37,285
No, l just--
l'd rather talk to you.

63
00:04:38,423 --> 00:04:40,414
Yes, l do.

64
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:42,719
Yes, l do have to go to the bathroom.

65
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:45,460
There's someone in here.

66
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:49,191
-Where's Chandler?
-He can't make it.

67
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:52,063
He said he had to go back
to his job and--

68
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:56,703
Joey?

69
00:04:58,043 --> 00:04:59,271
Joey Tribbiani?

70
00:05:05,317 --> 00:05:07,148
l can see you, okay?

71
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:09,444
You're hiding behind the coats.

72
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:21,757
Close one.

73
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:30,106
-Hi.
-Hi, sweetie.

74
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:33,004
-Hello.
-Hey, Ross.

75
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:38,407
-l've got some bad news.
-What?

76
00:05:38,683 --> 00:05:40,981
l can eat,
but l have to come back here.

77
00:05:41,186 --> 00:05:44,246
Come on. You've worked late
every night for two weeks.

78
00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:47,287
-What is it now?
-lt's my fault. l quit today.

79
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:49,426
But work comes first!

80
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:52,955
But that's sad about you, though.
What happened?

81
00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:56,690
What happened? Burn out?
Burn all out, did you?

82
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:00,796
He's leaving for a better job.

83
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,099
That's great.
So l guess this is goodbye then.

84
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:05,366
Goodbye.

85
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:08,935
Okay, then.

86
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:12,011
Well, we're gonna
miss you around here.

87
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:13,473
Yeah, me too.

88
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:19,318
-So see you on Saturday.
-Yeah, you bet!

89
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,370
Now, you know those
are a delicacy in lndia.

90
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:46,473
That was Leslie calling
to see if we can get back together.

91
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:50,814
lt's like the 20th time today.
Yeah, good luck, Leslie.

92
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:53,647
She must've hurt you bad.

93
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:56,690
Well, yeah.
You know, we were best friends...

94
00:06:56,928 --> 00:07:00,591
...ever since we were little.
Our moms worked on the barge together.

95
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:04,531
You two must've been so cute,
running around on a barge.

96
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:06,863
You never run on a barge!

97
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:12,935
ls Chandler around?

98
00:07:13,211 --> 00:07:15,543
He met some girl at the coffeehouse.

99
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,339
Ginger something.

100
00:07:21,186 --> 00:07:25,680
Sure it wasn't something that sounded
liked Ginger? Like ''Gingeer''?

101
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:28,554
No, it was Ginger.

102
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:30,886
l remember because
when he told me, l said:

103
00:07:31,196 --> 00:07:33,357
The movie star

104
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:37,626
Oh, man!
That's the girl l was hiding from.

105
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:40,530
When she sees he's my roommate,
she'll tell him what l did.

106
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:44,106
-What did you do?
-Oh, no! l can't....

107
00:07:45,443 --> 00:07:49,607
l can't tell you. lt's the
most awful thing l've ever done.

108
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:53,512
You're really not making us
want to hear it less.

109
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:54,845
Don't tell us.

110
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,681
We'll wait till Chandler gets home.
lt'll be more fun that way.

111
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:03,320
lt was, like, four years ago.

112
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:06,564
Ginger and l had gone out a few times.
Then one weekend...

113
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:08,255
...we went to her Dad's cabin...

114
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:12,334
...just me, her and her
annoying little dog, Pepper.

115
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,630
That night l cooked
this really romantic dinner--

116
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,740
You gave her food poisoning!

117
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:19,198
l wish.

118
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:24,345
After dinner, me, her and Pepper
fell asleep in front of the fire.

119
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:29,050
l woke up in the middle of the night
and saw the fire was dying out...

120
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:31,912
...so l picked up a log
and threw it on.

121
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,789
Or what l thought was a log.

122
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:38,554
Oh, my God!
You threw Pepper on the fire!

123
00:08:39,497 --> 00:08:40,555
l wish.

124
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:46,562
Another thing l probably
should've told you about Ginger...

125
00:08:46,771 --> 00:08:49,103
...is that she kind of has a...

126
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:50,900
...artificial leg.

127
00:08:57,015 --> 00:08:58,505
Oh, my God!

128
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:02,179
You threw it on the fire?

129
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:04,617
She must've freaked out.

130
00:09:05,223 --> 00:09:07,714
Yeah, she must've.

131
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:12,258
-You don't know?
-Well....

132
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,423
What did you do after
you threw her leg on the fire?

133
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:17,857
l ran!

134
00:09:19,604 --> 00:09:22,971
-You ran?
-Through the woods, with no socks on.

135
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:35,177
That's the best kiss l've had...

136
00:09:35,386 --> 00:09:37,877
...with anybody l met
in a men's room.

137
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,116
Actually, me too.

138
00:09:42,227 --> 00:09:44,286
Foot all in the puddle!

139
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:46,360
Damn! l hate that!

140
00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:49,624
-You'll have to get out of those shoes.
-Don't worry.

141
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:51,732
No, really.
You're gonna freeze.

142
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,301
No, l'm not.

143
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,538
You're not?
Have you got a bionic foot?

144
00:09:59,744 --> 00:10:01,507
Someday. Maybe.

145
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:13,583
Funny book?

146
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,996
l'm just thinking about
something funny l heard today.

147
00:10:20,498 --> 00:10:23,399
Mark saying,
''l'll see you Saturday.''

148
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:26,868
Yeah, at the lecture.

149
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:29,938
l told you last week.
You said you didn't mind.

150
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:33,041
lt's not the lecture l mind.

151
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,343
Please tell me it's not because
l'm going with Mark.

152
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:39,845
-Well--
-Oh, my God!

153
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:44,118
l'm sorry, but if you're not
working with him anymore...

154
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:46,289
...why do you still hang out?

155
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:48,219
Because he's my friend.

156
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:51,953
But do you really need
another ''friend''?

157
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:58,232
lf l stop playing with Joey
and Chandler, can l play with Mark?

158
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,398
ls that funny?
Am l suppose to be laughing?

159
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:05,269
l don't know. You thought
''See you Saturday'' was funny.

160
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,207
Mark is in fashion.

161
00:11:07,478 --> 00:11:10,470
l like having a friend
l can share this stuff with.

162
00:11:10,715 --> 00:11:13,878
You guys would never
go to a lecture with me.

163
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:18,781
-l'd love to go with you.
-Really?

164
00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:20,952
l have clothes.

165
00:11:21,226 --> 00:11:22,625
l even pick them out.

166
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:26,386
For all you know,
l could be a fashion...

167
00:11:27,131 --> 00:11:28,155
...monger.

168
00:11:33,738 --> 00:11:36,138
l would love for you to go with me.

169
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:38,072
What?

170
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:40,977
What should l wear?
Now l'm all nervous.

171
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:54,355
You know, they say
''A watched pot never beeps.''

172
00:11:57,428 --> 00:11:59,293
lt's been a couple hours...

173
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:01,826
...and she hasn't called.

174
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:04,692
Not that l even care. l don't.

175
00:12:05,536 --> 00:12:07,470
Why don't you just call her?

176
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:09,696
You obviously want to.

177
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:11,999
You think you know me so well.

178
00:12:12,343 --> 00:12:13,935
Well, don't you wanna?

179
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:17,971
So l do know you.

180
00:12:18,283 --> 00:12:19,716
That's what l said.

181
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,511
-Well, so?
-l can't.

182
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:27,218
l can't. She dumped me.

183
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:29,925
l totally trusted her,
then one day it was like:

184
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:32,187
''Okay, bye, Pheebs.''
Gone!

185
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:36,026
You know what the saddest part is?

186
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:38,700
When we were playing together,
that was...

187
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,030
...the most fun l've ever had
in all my lives.

188
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:48,910
My favorite shoes, so good to me
I wear them every day

189
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,140
Down at the heel, holes in the toes
Don't care what people say

190
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:57,183
My feet's best friend
Pals to the end

191
00:12:57,422 --> 00:13:00,016
With them, I'm one hot chickie

192
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:03,692
Though late one night
Not much light

193
00:13:03,895 --> 00:13:07,490
I stepped in something icky

194
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:13,031
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes

195
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:15,831
Always make me smile

196
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,103
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes
Next time I'll...

197
00:13:22,113 --> 00:13:24,946
...avoid the...

198
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:26,911
...pile!

199
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:37,985
We're beginning to see a lot of
layering of sheer fabrics and colors.

200
00:13:38,262 --> 00:13:41,527
For instance, a sheer navy blouse
over a pink....

201
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:44,200
l'm really glad we came.

202
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,572
You're so pretty.

203
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:55,043
l love you.

204
00:13:58,716 --> 00:14:01,617
Smelly cat, smelly cat

205
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:04,549
What are they feeding you?

206
00:14:04,822 --> 00:14:08,053
Smelly cat, smelly cat

207
00:14:08,326 --> 00:14:11,022
It's not your fault

208
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:15,188
-That's great!
-Yeah?

209
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:17,561
You know, you could totally sell this.

210
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:21,738
lt'd be perfect for, like,
a kitty-litter campaign.

211
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:24,473
A jingle?

212
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:26,634
Why not?
You'd make a ton of money.

213
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:30,336
lf l was in this for the money,
l'd be a millionaire by now.

214
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,483
You gotta get out of
that jingle-head.

215
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:38,248
You're right.
You're right. l'm sorry.

216
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:39,478
That's okay.

217
00:14:39,657 --> 00:14:42,820
l'm gonna play a song now
that's really, really sad.

218
00:14:43,027 --> 00:14:45,928
lt's called ''Magician Box Mix-Up.''

219
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:53,897
Oversized bracelets,
oversized earrings...

220
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:58,199
...oversizing of accessories,
in general, is very popular now.

221
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:13,053
Can l borrow this?
My milk's gone bad.

222
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,280
l hate that.

223
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:17,790
l once had a thing of half-and-half.
Stole my car.

224
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:22,758
So how was your date with Ginger?

225
00:15:24,101 --> 00:15:25,432
Great.

226
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:27,127
lt was great. She's....

227
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:30,306
She's great. Great looks
and personality. Greatness.

228
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:34,536
Sounds like she's got the...

229
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:36,479
...whole package.

230
00:15:39,984 --> 00:15:42,350
So she's got it all, huh?

231
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:44,948
She's the real deal?

232
00:15:45,823 --> 00:15:48,155
Joey told you about the leg, huh?

233
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:51,928
Oh, God!
lt freaked me out.

234
00:15:52,163 --> 00:15:53,790
lt shouldn't, but it did.

235
00:15:53,998 --> 00:15:56,558
l wanna keep seeing her,
but it's like:

236
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:59,234
''Hey, you know what?
Where's your leg?''

237
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:07,572
l'm the smallest person in the world,
aren't l?

238
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:09,109
Morning.

239
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,147
Actually, he's the smallest person
in the world.

240
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:20,114
Heard about the leg-burning, huh?

241
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,954
lt came up.

242
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:27,596
Listen, l know it's a long shot, but...

243
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,964
...by any chance,
did she find that funny?

244
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:38,268
So l nodded off a little!

245
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:41,501
''Nodded off''?
Ross, you were snoring!

246
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:45,909
My father's boat didn't make
that much noise when it hit rocks!

247
00:16:46,117 --> 00:16:48,551
Come on! Forty-five minutes....

248
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:52,849
Forty-five minutes, the man talked
about strappy-backed dresses.

249
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:58,552
Okay, how about four hours
in a freezing museum auditorium...

250
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:01,059
...listening to
Professor ''Pitstains'' say:

251
00:17:01,332 --> 00:17:04,665
''Remember that thing that died
a gazillion years ago?

252
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:08,235
Well, here's a little bone
we didn't know it had!''

253
00:17:11,676 --> 00:17:15,612
First of all, it's Professor Pitain.

254
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:18,738
And second of all,
that little bone proved that...

255
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,351
...that particular dinosaur had wings
but didn't fly.

256
00:17:22,553 --> 00:17:24,680
Okay, you know what l just heard?

257
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:33,861
A hundred million people
went to see a movie about what l do.

258
00:17:34,065 --> 00:17:38,593
l wonder how many people would go see
a movie called Jurassic Parka.

259
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:40,894
Oh, that is so--

260
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:45,633
A bunch of out-of-control jackets
take over an island!

261
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:54,110
lf what l do is so lame...

262
00:17:54,318 --> 00:17:57,947
...then why did you insist on coming
with me this morning?

263
00:17:58,222 --> 00:18:01,089
Was it so l just wouldn't
go with Mark?

264
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:05,656
l wanted to be with you.

265
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:08,591
l don't know, l feel like lately...

266
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,801
...you're slipping away from me...

267
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:13,470
...with this new job
and all these new people.

268
00:18:13,671 --> 00:18:16,435
And you've got this
whole other life going on.

269
00:18:16,641 --> 00:18:18,609
l know it's dumb...

270
00:18:18,843 --> 00:18:22,939
...but l just hate
that l'm not a part of it.

271
00:18:27,418 --> 00:18:28,851
lt's not dumb.

272
00:18:30,521 --> 00:18:33,615
But maybe it's okay
that you're not a part of it.

273
00:18:33,858 --> 00:18:35,086
You know what l mean?

274
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:37,753
l mean, it's like...

275
00:18:37,962 --> 00:18:42,160
...l like that you're not
involved in that part of my life.

276
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:44,662
That's a little clearer.

277
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,666
See, it doesn't mean
l don't love you...

278
00:18:48,973 --> 00:18:52,101
...because l do.
l love you so much.

279
00:18:52,343 --> 00:18:54,709
But my work--
lt's for me, you know?

280
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:57,446
l'm out there on my own,
and l'm doing it.

281
00:18:57,682 --> 00:19:01,778
And it's scary,
but l love it because it's mine.

282
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:04,678
But l mean, is that okay?

283
00:19:05,122 --> 00:19:06,316
Sure.

284
00:19:16,467 --> 00:19:18,401
You're thinking about my leg.

285
00:19:20,571 --> 00:19:23,404
Actually, l forgot.
What's the deal with that again?

286
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:26,474
Look, it's okay if it bothers you.

287
00:19:26,677 --> 00:19:29,544
l only need to know
how much it bothers you...

288
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:32,011
...because l don't like
wasting my time.

289
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:34,248
Am l wasting my time?

290
00:19:35,986 --> 00:19:37,681
No, l don't think so.

291
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:42,222
lt's like anything else.
You just have to get used to it.

292
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:56,798
What's that?

293
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:58,905
That's my ''nubbin.''

294
00:20:03,748 --> 00:20:05,181
What's a nubbin?

295
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:10,376
lt's kind of a third-nipple
kind of thing.

296
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:13,546
You have three nipples?

297
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:15,783
Well, you know, two regulars...

298
00:20:16,427 --> 00:20:19,794
...and one that
barely qualifies as a--

299
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:25,299
-What?
-Nothing. You know, l....

300
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:27,730
l just remembered.
l have to leave.

301
00:20:27,972 --> 00:20:31,373
You have to leave? Now? How come?

302
00:20:31,575 --> 00:20:33,372
Well, it's nubbin.
Nothing!

303
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:38,679
You know what?
l'll see you later.

304
00:20:47,191 --> 00:20:48,624
l thought you weren't coming.

305
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,287
-Where were you?
-Come here, come here.

306
00:20:53,197 --> 00:20:54,357
Don't get mad, okay?

307
00:20:54,598 --> 00:20:57,328
Don't give me a reason to get mad,
okay?

308
00:20:58,002 --> 00:21:01,961
l played Smelly Cat for
my old ad agency. They went nuts!

309
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:05,506
l told you l didn't want you
to try and sell it...

310
00:21:05,776 --> 00:21:09,041
...and you just big, fat did it anyway!

311
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:14,615
l think, five years ago,
l probably would have done anything...

312
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:16,218
...to play with you.

313
00:21:16,453 --> 00:21:19,854
But l can do it myself.
lf l can't trust you, then forget it.

314
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:21,814
l don't wanna forget it.

315
00:21:22,026 --> 00:21:23,789
You know what?
You have to choose.

316
00:21:23,994 --> 00:21:27,157
lf the most important thing
on the planet to you...

317
00:21:27,364 --> 00:21:32,495
...is this cat-poopy thing,
then you can have Smelly Cat.

318
00:21:32,703 --> 00:21:34,671
But we won't be partners.

319
00:21:35,306 --> 00:21:36,773
So, what's it gonna be?

320
00:21:36,974 --> 00:21:40,273
-Smelly cat, smelly cat
-Problem odor in the litter box?

321
00:21:40,477 --> 00:21:43,810
Don't change your kitty,
change your kitty litter.

322
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:46,547
lt's not your fault

323
00:21:49,286 --> 00:21:51,811
-Sorry, Pheebs.
-Yeah.

324
00:21:51,989 --> 00:21:53,251
You okay?

325
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:56,190
l actually am.

326
00:21:56,427 --> 00:22:00,090
Because, you know, life's gonna
hand you all kinds of stuff.

327
00:22:00,397 --> 00:22:03,366
You learn your little lessons
and hopefully you grow.

328
00:22:04,535 --> 00:22:07,197
-You wanna hear a new song?
-We'd love to.

329
00:22:09,974 --> 00:22:11,669
Jingle bitch screwed me over

330
00:22:13,844 --> 00:22:15,471
Go to hell, jingle whore

331
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:19,706
Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell

332
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:22,443
That's all l have so far.

333
00:22:26,323 --> 00:22:27,790
Well, hello!

334
00:22:28,926 --> 00:22:30,723
-Where you been?
-The doctor.

335
00:22:30,928 --> 00:22:32,327
ls everything okay?

336
00:22:32,596 --> 00:22:35,064
Just had me
a little nubbin-ectomy.

337
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:40,498
Two nipples, no waiting.

338
00:22:40,704 --> 00:22:44,105
Well! Just like Rachel
in high school.

339
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:46,431
What?

340
00:22:47,311 --> 00:22:50,474
Come on, l was kidding!
lt was such an obvious joke.

341
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:52,512
That was an obvious joke.

342
00:22:52,783 --> 00:22:54,774
And l didn't think of it. Why?

343
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,045
The source of all my powers.

344
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,258
