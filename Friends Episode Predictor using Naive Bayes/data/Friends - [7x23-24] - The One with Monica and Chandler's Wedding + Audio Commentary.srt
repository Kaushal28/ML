1
00:00:01,813 --> 00:00:05,647
Do you reaIize this is the Iast time
we'II be here...

2
00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:07,444
...as si<i>x</i> singIe peopIe?

3
00:00:07,619 --> 00:00:10,588
What's happening to the coffeehouse?

4
00:00:14,192 --> 00:00:17,821
From now on, it's you four
and me and the missus.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,557
The IittIe woman. The wife.
The oId baII and chain.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,067
-OId?
-The young, hot baII and chain.

7
00:00:25,337 --> 00:00:27,805
-Much better.
-We gotta go.

8
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:32,000
-Where?
-Get the dress and Iunch with Mom.

9
00:00:32,177 --> 00:00:34,042
Joey, you too?

10
00:00:34,246 --> 00:00:36,441
I just heard ''Iunch.''

11
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:38,940
Yeah, I can go. Sure.

12
00:00:41,486 --> 00:00:45,547
ActuaIIy, I'm gIad they're Ieaving.

13
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,349
I need to taIk to you
about something.

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,695
-What's up?
-This may be a IittIe awkward.

15
00:00:51,897 --> 00:00:56,732
If you need money, it's a bad time.
I'm buying 1 28 dinners tomorrow.

16
00:00:57,269 --> 00:00:59,203
No, it's not that.

17
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:03,436
I'm not gonna say this
as your friend...

18
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:06,134
...but as Monica's oIder brother.

19
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:09,838
-But you're stiII my friend?
-Not for a few minutes.

20
00:01:10,015 --> 00:01:14,918
-Right now, are you stiII my best man?
-No.

21
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:18,147
Do I stiII caII you Ross?

22
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:25,491
You guys are getting married,
and I couIdn't be more thriIIed.

23
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:29,464
But as her oIder brother,
I have to teII you this:

24
00:01:31,503 --> 00:01:34,870
If you ever hurt my IittIe sister...

25
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,742
...if you ever cause her
any unhappiness of any kind...

26
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:43,172
...I wiII hunt you down...

27
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:46,107
...and kick your ass.

28
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:55,486
What? I'm serious.

29
00:01:57,462 --> 00:02:02,490
-Dude! Stop it! I'm not kidding.
-I hear what you're saying...

30
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:05,428
...and thanks for the warning.

31
00:02:05,604 --> 00:02:06,969
No probIem.

32
00:02:07,673 --> 00:02:10,198
Are we friends again?

33
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:11,772
Yeah.

34
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:16,345
You won't beIieve what Monica's
brother just said to me!

35
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:19,779
The One With Monica and ChandIer's
Wedding

36
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,487
What you doing, Mon?

37
00:02:56,655 --> 00:03:00,648
I'm Iisting things that
couId go wrong at the wedding.

38
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,155
So I can be prepared.

39
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:08,823
-What are they?
-So far, the dresses won't get picked up...

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,458
...my veiI gets Iost
or I don't have something bIue.

41
00:03:12,637 --> 00:03:14,730
I'm responsibIe for aII those.

42
00:03:16,274 --> 00:03:18,105
I had to go with the odds.

43
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:23,405
Remember that audition I had a whiIe ago
and I didn't get the part?

44
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:25,516
-The commerciaI?
-That pIay?

45
00:03:25,684 --> 00:03:27,549
That other pIay?

46
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,550
-The movie?
-Yes!

47
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:32,121
The one about the dog
who fIies pIanes?

48
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,316
No. But, man, that one hurt.

49
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:39,725
-This is the one about WWI soIdiers.
-Oh, yeah.

50
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:42,729
Back then we caIIed it
''The Great War.''

51
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:45,963
It reaIIy was.

52
00:03:47,305 --> 00:03:51,173
The guy they wanted backed out!
I start shooting today!

53
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:52,469
CongratuIations!

54
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:56,205
-Today's the rehearsaI dinner.
-I'II be done by then.

55
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:59,214
Oh. Then way to go,
you big movie star!

56
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:02,046
See you. I'm off
to fight the Nazis.

57
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,714
Wait, Joey. We fought the Nazis
in WWII, not WWI.

58
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:11,092
Who was in WWI?

59
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,564
Go ahead.

60
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:18,696
You're gonna be Iate!
Go! Go!

61
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:23,497
Who did we fight in WWI?

62
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:26,374
-Me<i>x</i>ico?
-Yes. Very good.

63
00:04:42,227 --> 00:04:45,162
-Hey, Joey. We're ready.
-Yeah, me too.

64
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,423
Richard, we're ready for you.

65
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:51,729
Joey Tribbiani, this is Richard Crosby.
He's pIaying Vincent.

66
00:04:52,504 --> 00:04:55,371
-I'm acting with you?
-Nice to meet you.

67
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,738
I can't beIieve this. This is incredibIe.
You just won an Oscar.

68
00:05:00,378 --> 00:05:02,073
No, I didn't.

69
00:05:02,814 --> 00:05:04,441
I think you did.

70
00:05:05,617 --> 00:05:08,586
I think I Iost, three times.

71
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:13,055
-Cookie? WouId you...?
-No.

72
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:17,286
We're about an hour away
from getting the scene Iit.

73
00:05:17,462 --> 00:05:21,762
-Can you guys run it a coupIe times?
-Yeah, sure.

74
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:23,764
AII right. Let's do it.

75
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:27,527
And.... Action!

76
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,866
-We have to find the pIatoon!
-Forget it, the pIatoon is gone!

77
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,216
-What?
-The pIatoon's dead! Face facts, Tony!

78
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:44,113
What'II we do?
We have no reinforcements or food.

79
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:48,055
There's food in the basement.
Potatoes and some pasta.

80
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:52,692
Hang on.
Joey, you keep touching your face.

81
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:53,956
Something wrong?

82
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:56,727
No. No.

83
00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:01,395
I thought it might be
a cooI character thing.

84
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:04,440
He's a face toucher.

85
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:09,612
I don't think so.

86
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:15,075
Let's take it back
to Richard's Iast Iines. Action!

87
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:18,788
We may not have weapons,
but we stiII have food.

88
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:20,447
Potatoes, pasta...

89
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,593
...and a few tins of tuna!

90
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:27,424
Honey, we gotta go!

91
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:30,429
Here's a <i>q</i>uestion
you never want to ask:

92
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:34,595
Can my dad borrow one of your
pearI neckIaces?

93
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:38,970
Did he say what kind of neckIine
he's wearing?

94
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:40,236
No.

95
00:06:40,812 --> 00:06:43,303
I just met him once,
but I'm guessing...

96
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:44,470
...pIunging?

97
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:49,348
He is more of a if-you've-got-it-
fIaunt-it kind of father.

98
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:52,889
Let me see if RacheI has anything.

99
00:06:53,058 --> 00:06:55,026
Yes, incIude more peopIe in this.

100
00:06:57,028 --> 00:07:01,089
Do you reaIize that at this time tomorrow
we're gonna be getting married?

101
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:03,257
I have a date tomorrow night.

102
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:08,936
-I can't beIieve we made it.
-Don't sound so surprised.

103
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:10,574
I'm sorry, but....

104
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:14,134
-Nothing.
-What?

105
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,474
WeII, honestIy?
Ever since we got engaged...

106
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,642
...I've been waiting for something
to fIip you out.

107
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,549
HonestIy? Me too.

108
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:26,646
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

109
00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:30,727
I think that something
wiII come up and I'II go aII....

110
00:07:30,895 --> 00:07:32,419
WeII, ChandIer.

111
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:35,759
-But nothing has.
-I'm so gIad.

112
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:38,698
Thank you for staying
so caIm during this.

113
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,100
It's made me stay caIm.

114
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:44,398
I couId've been worse.

115
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:46,600
I'II be right there.

116
00:07:53,485 --> 00:07:56,977
<i>If you're calling before Saturday,</i>
<i>you've reached Monica and Chandler.</i>

117
00:07:57,155 --> 00:08:02,354
<i>But if you're calling after Saturday,</i>
<i>you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing.</i>

118
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:05,462
<i>Please leave a message for...the Bings!</i>

119
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:24,506
Hey, Maureen! Hi!

120
00:08:24,682 --> 00:08:28,812
-This is my cousin, Maureen.
-We're the Bings.

121
00:08:32,023 --> 00:08:34,753
Hi! You guys Iook so beautifuI.

Monica.

124
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:45,835
So you know, I had my
''oIder brother'' taIk with ChandIer.

125
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:47,369
What is that?

126
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:50,770
I toId him that if he ever hurt you...

127
00:08:50,942 --> 00:08:54,776
...I wouId hunt him down
and kick his ass.

128
00:08:57,816 --> 00:09:01,081
What is the matter with everybody?
I'm serious.

129
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:02,742
I wouId kick his ass!

130
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,551

00:09:10,862 --> 00:09:12,955
-ChandIer.
-Mom.

132
00:09:13,131 --> 00:09:15,929
Thanks for wearing...something.

133
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:23,064
This is so e<i>x</i>citing! I thought we
screwed you up too much for this.

134
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:29,209
Just think, soon there wiII be
Iots of IittIe Bings.

135
00:09:34,018 --> 00:09:37,510
I can't beIieve I'm going back to work
to get spit on again.

136
00:09:37,722 --> 00:09:41,590
You're Iucky. At Ieast the peopIe
that spit on you are famous.

137
00:09:42,694 --> 00:09:46,255
-Who spits on you?
-I don't want to taIk about work.

138
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:51,792
Mrs. Bing? These are my parents,
Judy and Jack GeIIer.

139
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,929
-It's IoveIy to meet you.
-Are you his mother or father?

140
00:09:56,107 --> 00:09:57,734
Jack!

141
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,335
What? I've never seen one before.

142
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:03,879
Dad, there's Ross.
Go taIk to him.

143
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:07,381
I wasn't even abIe to act
Iike I'm okay with it.

144
00:10:10,588 --> 00:10:12,613
HeIIo, aII.

145
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,790
Hi...Dad.

146
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:19,494

00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,001
-It's so great to see you both here.
-Yes.

149
00:10:29,174 --> 00:10:32,769
AIthough we may be seeing
too much of some peopIe.

150
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:38,779
Aren't you a IittIe oId
to wear a dress Iike that?

151
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:43,114
Don't you have a IittIe too much penis
to wear a dress Iike that?

152
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:46,586
Oh, my God.

153
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:51,958
Of course you can kick his ass, son.

154
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,566
You couId kick anyone's ass
you want to.

155
00:10:56,768 --> 00:10:59,134
Thanks, you guys.

156
00:11:02,707 --> 00:11:04,038

00:11:08,313 --> 00:11:12,682

159
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:23,861

00:11:44,182 --> 00:11:47,743

00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:54,054
And I'm the best man.

167
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:59,026
And I have to say, I'm a IittIe surprised
we're aII here today.

168
00:11:59,197 --> 00:12:02,633
For those of you
who don't know ChandIer...

169
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,894
...he's not the biggest fan
of reIationships.

170
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:09,937
In fact, I think before he met Monica...

171
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:14,511
...the onIy reaI reIationship he had was
with a girI named MoIIy.

172
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:19,139
And he wouId've married her,
onIy she couIdn't controI her bIadder.

173
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:26,886
It was his dog.
Did I say it was his dog?

174
00:12:27,492 --> 00:12:29,585
Any-- Anyway....

175
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:35,555
This marriage is doubIy speciaI for me...

176
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:39,829
...because not onIy is the groom
my best friend...

177
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:44,668
...but the bride is my IittIe sister.

178
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:49,606
She's the greatest sister
a guy couId ask for.

179
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:53,378
PIease join me in raising a gIass...

180
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:57,544
...to the coupIe we're
here to ceIebrate.

181
00:12:57,922 --> 00:13:00,618
-To the Bings.
-To the Bings!

182
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:15,803
How cooI is it that the ne<i>x</i>t time you see
ChandIer you'II be waIking down the aisIe?

183
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:19,773
I can't beIieve that after tomorrow
it's aII gonna be over.

184
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:24,779
Honey, it's not gonna be over.
You're gonna be married to ChandIer.

185
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:28,652
Maybe I can wear the dress for HaIIoween!

186
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:32,446
I'm gonna steam my dress.

187
00:13:32,623 --> 00:13:35,285
Who wiII make sure nothing
happens to it?

188
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,190
-I'II do it.
-Who wants it? Anybody?

189
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,930
-I said, I'II do it.
-Nobody?

190
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:45,468
-AII right, I'II do it myseIf.
-I'm not gonna screw it up.

191
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:49,404
You're right. I'm sorry.
You were a big heIp tonight.

192
00:13:49,574 --> 00:13:53,169
Thanks for heIping my grandmother
get to the hoteI safeIy.

193
00:13:53,344 --> 00:13:57,508
-Of course! That's what I'm here for.
-Okay. Sorry.

194
00:13:59,617 --> 00:14:01,016
What grandmother?

195
00:14:05,156 --> 00:14:08,990
-Where have you been?
-Taking my parents to the hoteI.

196
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,424
-Going back to work?
-Yeah.

197
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:13,359
-Nice shades.
-Thanks.

198
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:17,661
I figure if I wear these in my scenes,
I won't get spit in my eyes.

199
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:23,671
And, if I remember correctIy,
Ray-Ban was the officiaI sponsor of WWI.

200
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:27,443
Great! AII right!

201
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,744
-I'II see you Iater.
-AII right.

202
00:14:29,914 --> 00:14:33,042
-Where's ChandIer?
-I think he's in RacheI's room.

203
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:35,750
ChandIer?

204
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:03,712
-Is Monica here?
-She's steaming her dress. Why?

205
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:08,240
-I think ChandIer's gone.
-What?

206
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:12,355
-He Ieft that.
-''TeII Monica I'm sorry.''

207
00:15:13,324 --> 00:15:14,951
Oh, my God.

208
00:15:15,626 --> 00:15:17,116
What's up?

209
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,821
''TeII Monica I'm sorry.''

210
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:25,232
TeII her yourseIf.

211
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,401
Oh, my God.
ChandIer just Ieft, though?

212
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:37,173
Maybe it's not what we think.
Maybe it's:

213
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:41,375
''TeII Monica I'm sorry
I drank the Iast of the miIk.''

214
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:45,989
Or ''TeII Monica I'm sorry
I used her tweezers to pIuck my nose hair.''

215
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:48,752
He does that. I've seen him.

216
00:15:50,328 --> 00:15:56,563
Or maybe he was writing to teII her
that he's changed his name:

217
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:59,828
''TeII Monica I'm Sorry.''

218
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:07,609
-It means he freaked out and Ieft!
-Don't be so negative!

219
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:13,182
Good God, isn't it possibIe that
''Sorry'' is sitting in there right now?

220
00:16:14,285 --> 00:16:18,415
Phoebe, I think Ross is right.
What are we gonna do?

221
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:22,150
I'm gonna have to go find him
and bring him back.

222
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,955
You make sure Monica
does not find out, okay?

223
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,393
But if you don't find him
and bring him back...

224
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:32,968
...I am gonna hunt you down
and kick your ass!

225
00:16:35,606 --> 00:16:37,437
I wiII find him.

226
00:16:44,782 --> 00:16:46,773
WeII, the dress is done.

227
00:16:47,985 --> 00:16:49,350
What?

228
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,421
We're just so happy for you.

229
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:55,021
That's so sweet!

230
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,894
Can we just take a minute and taIk about
the man I'm gonna marry tomorrow.

231
00:17:00,064 --> 00:17:02,362
I mean, how Iucky am I?

232
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,193
That's a good <i>q</i>uestion.

233
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:10,769
I just hope that someday
you guys find someone Iike ChandIer.

234
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:14,673
I hope we find someone e<i>x</i>actIy
Iike ChandIer and soon.

235
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:23,011
Joey? Can you
go through these Iines with me?

236
00:17:23,187 --> 00:17:26,179
Oh, man, they just re-did my makeup.

237
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:30,790
-Just the Iast two pages.
-AII right.

238
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:36,829
I found the picture!

239
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:39,998
Picture? What picture?

240
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:43,265
The picture of my wife
I found in your pack.

241
00:17:43,841 --> 00:17:48,141
-CouId you Iower the script?
-I don't want to.

242
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,412
I need to see your face
so I can pIay off your reaction.

243
00:17:54,318 --> 00:17:55,683
Okay, Iook.

244
00:17:55,853 --> 00:18:00,586
I know you're great
and pIay aII those Shakespeare guys...

245
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:03,226
...but you're spitting
aII over me, man.

246
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:07,320
-Of course I am!
-You know you've been spitting?

247
00:18:07,498 --> 00:18:09,591
That's what reaI actors do.

248
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:14,165
Enunciation is the mark
of a good actor.

249
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:17,432
And when you enunciate, you spit!

250
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,506
Didn't know that.

251
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,114
Thanks. Okay, check it out.

252
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:29,586
Picture? What picture?

253
00:18:38,396 --> 00:18:41,957
-Gunther, have you seen ChandIer?
-No, I haven't seen him.

254
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:45,227
-Damn.
-He's getting married tomorrow, right?

255
00:18:45,403 --> 00:18:48,167
Yes. Don't worry.
Everything's fine.

256
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:52,105
-We'II see you tomorrow at the wedding.
-I wasn't invited.

257
00:18:53,744 --> 00:18:56,941
Then we'II see you
the day after tomorrow.

258
00:18:59,617 --> 00:19:01,346
Mom? Dad?

259
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:03,714
What are you doing here?

260
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:07,619
We thought we'd see what
the fuss is aII about.

261
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:11,353
-I see why the girIs Iike coming here.
-Why?

262
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:14,191
The se<i>x</i>y bIond behind the counter.

263
00:19:19,937 --> 00:19:23,805
-Gunther?
-She just added him to her Iist.

264
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:28,677
-What? Your Iist?
-Of peopIe we're aIIowed to sIeep--

265
00:19:28,846 --> 00:19:31,474
I know what the Iist is.

266
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:34,345
Come on, sit down.
Have a cup of joe.

267
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:38,112
Dad, I can't. I'm sorry.

268
00:19:38,322 --> 00:19:41,723
If you see ChandIer,
teII him I'm Iooking for him.

269
00:19:41,892 --> 00:19:46,329
And if you see Rita Moreno,
Iet her know I'm Iooking for her.

270
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:53,168
Action!

271
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,301
I found the picture!

272
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,010
What picture?

273
00:20:02,146 --> 00:20:05,206
The picture of my wife, in your pack!

274
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,683
You went through my personaI property?

275
00:20:09,954 --> 00:20:13,390
Why do you have a picture of PauIette
in your pack?

276
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,993
Because, Vincent, we were Iovers...

277
00:20:21,232 --> 00:20:23,132
...for two years!

278
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:26,030
Cut! WonderfuI!

279
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,033
Great scene!

280
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:34,473
You were awesome. In that
Iast speech, you soaked me.

281
00:20:34,645 --> 00:20:37,739
-Tomorrow's caII sheet.
-I'm not working tomorrow.

282
00:20:37,915 --> 00:20:41,316
-You are now.
-No, you gotta get me out of it.

283
00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:43,544
I have pIans. Important pIans!

284
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:55,726
-Ross said stiII no word from ChandIer.
-Oh, man.

285
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,392
But they found the grandmother
wandering down 5th Avenue.

286
00:21:00,905 --> 00:21:03,305
Okay, weII, there's one down.

287
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:06,173
I'm getting married today!

288
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,948
I cracked a rib, but I don't care.
Today's my wedding!

289
00:21:14,118 --> 00:21:16,484
My day is finaIIy here!

290
00:21:19,256 --> 00:21:22,191
She might not even notice he's gone.

291
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:25,756
I'm gonna start getting ready!

292
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:31,626
We can't Iet her start getting ready.
This is too awfuI!

293
00:21:31,802 --> 00:21:35,169
But she'II be in the gown
and then he won't show up...

294
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:38,137
...then she'II have
to take off the gown--

295
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:40,937
Stop it. You can't do this here.

296
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:44,113
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

297
00:21:44,281 --> 00:21:46,841
It's just so sad.

298
00:21:47,017 --> 00:21:50,009
PuII it together.
She can't see you Iike this.

299
00:21:50,187 --> 00:21:54,283
-She'II know something's wrong.
-I know. I know. Oh, God!

300
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,119
There's no tissue.

301
00:21:56,293 --> 00:21:58,591
Can you grab me some toiIet paper?

302
00:21:58,762 --> 00:22:02,823
Oh, that's gone too.
This is Monica's bathroom, right?

303
00:22:03,634 --> 00:22:06,159
-I found one.
-Okay.

304
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:10,503
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

305
00:22:10,674 --> 00:22:12,574
Oh, God.

306
00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:17,244
Can I have another one?

307
00:22:18,415 --> 00:22:19,677
Sure.

308
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,754
Do you need some fIoss?

309
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:30,024
I can't imagine what wiII happen
if he doesn't show up.

310
00:22:30,194 --> 00:22:31,957
Here's a whoIe bunch.

311
00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:34,529
She'II be at the wedding waiting...

312
00:22:34,698 --> 00:22:38,225
...and peopIe wiII be whispering,
''Oh, that poor girI.''

313
00:22:38,402 --> 00:22:41,735
Then she'II have to come back here
and Iive aIone.

314
00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:43,897
-Oh, my God.
-What?

315
00:22:44,074 --> 00:22:49,410
There was a pregnancy test in the
garbage. And it's positive.

316
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,570
Monica's pregnant.

317
00:22:54,485 --> 00:22:57,147
So I guess she won't be totaIIy aIone.

318
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:03,151
Oh, my God!

319
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:06,694
I know. Monica's gonna have a baby!

320
00:23:06,864 --> 00:23:09,765
Can this count as her ''something new''?

321
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:11,932
Oh, my God.

322
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:18,335
Do you think this is why
ChandIer took off?

323
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:22,536
She had to have just taken that test.
I took out the trash Iast night.

324
00:23:22,713 --> 00:23:25,204
It's turning into
the worst wedding ever.

325
00:23:25,382 --> 00:23:30,012
The bride's pregnant, the groom's missing
and I'm stiII hoIding this.

326
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:35,620
Phoebe, we cannot teII anyone
about this.

327
00:23:35,793 --> 00:23:38,091
-Right. Yeah.
-Okay?

328
00:23:38,262 --> 00:23:41,720
Hey, wait. Do you know
what kind of birth controI she uses?

329
00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:42,991
No. Why?

330
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:47,001
Just for the future.
This is hardIy a commerciaI for it.

331
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:53,966
Anything?

332
00:23:54,144 --> 00:23:57,545
No. I taIked to Joey on the set.
He hasn't heard from him.

333
00:23:57,715 --> 00:24:00,206
I taIked to ChandIer's parents again.

334
00:24:00,384 --> 00:24:01,681
You said he was missing?

335
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:04,650
No. I made it seem Iike I caIIed to chat.

336
00:24:04,822 --> 00:24:08,189
Pretty sure they both think
I'm interested in them.

337
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,987
-We've got to teII her he's gone.
-No, we can't.

338
00:24:11,161 --> 00:24:13,391
She'II start getting ready soon.

339
00:24:13,564 --> 00:24:17,898
Can't you staII her? I'II go back
to the pIaces I went Iast night.

340
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:19,330
How much time?

341
00:24:19,503 --> 00:24:22,336
How Iong before she absoIuteIy
has to start getting ready?

342
00:24:22,506 --> 00:24:24,030
-One hour.
-Give me two.

343
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:26,335
Then why do you ask?

344
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:30,305
-Wish me Iuck.
-I'm going with you.

345
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:32,042
Why?

346
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:36,846
You're tired. You Iooked aII night.
And, cIearIy, you suck at this.

347
00:24:37,021 --> 00:24:40,252
I have documented night bIindness.

348
00:24:41,225 --> 00:24:42,283
No, you don't!

349
00:24:42,459 --> 00:24:44,654
Okay. But I don't suck!

350
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:46,121
See you Iater.

351
00:24:46,296 --> 00:24:48,491
Do you know how
you're gonna staII her?

352
00:24:48,665 --> 00:24:51,031
Because she is insane
about her scheduIe today.

353
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:54,500
-I'II figure something out.
-Okay, good Iuck.

354
00:24:56,673 --> 00:25:00,370
I thought we'd start with my makeup
and then do my hair.

355
00:25:00,544 --> 00:25:04,446
Okay. But before you do that,
I need you to taIk to me.

356
00:25:04,815 --> 00:25:06,407
About what?

357
00:25:08,752 --> 00:25:12,518
I'm never gonna get married!

358
00:25:12,689 --> 00:25:15,817
You wiII. The right guy's
just around the corner.

359
00:25:15,993 --> 00:25:18,086
Okay, are we done with that?

360
00:25:18,896 --> 00:25:20,659
No, I'm serious.

361
00:25:21,065 --> 00:25:26,093
Maybe I shouId just forget about it.
Become a Iesbian or something.

362
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,534
Any woman wouId be Iucky to have you.

363
00:25:30,874 --> 00:25:33,741
Maybe I'd feeI better
if I sIept with Joey.

364
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:35,902
RacheI? Are you okay?

365
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:45,715
E<i>x</i>cuse me, Aaron? I have
a IittIe probIem with the scheduIe.

366
00:25:45,889 --> 00:25:50,792
I wasn't supposed to work today.
I have a wedding that I have to be at.

367
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:53,759
It's my best friend's
and I'm officiating...

368
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:55,865
...so I reaIIy can't work past 4.

369
00:25:56,633 --> 00:26:01,502
You've gotta stay untiI the end.
We can't stop fiIming just for you.

370
00:26:01,672 --> 00:26:03,970
It's not Iike it's your wedding.

371
00:26:04,141 --> 00:26:06,302
It is my wedding.

372
00:26:06,477 --> 00:26:08,536
Did I not make that cIear?

373
00:26:08,946 --> 00:26:11,107
You said your best friend
is getting married.

374
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:12,612
Yeah, to me.

375
00:26:12,783 --> 00:26:16,617
Yeah, I'm marrying my best friend.
Isn't that beautifuI?

376
00:26:17,454 --> 00:26:20,218
-But you said you were officiating.
-Yeah.

377
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:24,019
-Your own wedding?
-Happens more than you think.

378
00:26:25,162 --> 00:26:27,824
I'm sorry, Joey. It's stiII no.

379
00:26:28,565 --> 00:26:30,533
I'm having surgery.

380
00:26:31,835 --> 00:26:33,029
What?

381
00:26:33,203 --> 00:26:37,697
I made up the stuff about the wedding
because I didn't want you to worry.

382
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,706
But I'm having surgery today.

383
00:26:40,043 --> 00:26:41,533
What kind of surgery?

384
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:44,504
TranspIant.

385
00:26:46,283 --> 00:26:48,877
But you're supposed to work on Monday.

386
00:26:49,052 --> 00:26:51,612
Hair transpIant.

387
00:26:51,922 --> 00:26:53,355
But you're not baId.

388
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:56,454
It's not on my head.

389
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,831
There's nothing I can do.
You'II probabIy be out by 4 anyway.

390
00:27:05,002 --> 00:27:09,564
We've just got one short scene,
it's just you and Richard and he's a pro.

391
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,731
You'II be fine.

392
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:13,776
Morning, Richard.

393
00:27:13,944 --> 00:27:17,004
Hey, you're here! Great!
Let's go, buddy!

394
00:27:17,181 --> 00:27:19,445
We got a scene to shoot!

395
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:23,045
I'm wearing two beIts.

396
00:27:26,356 --> 00:27:28,586
-Are you drunk?
-No.

397
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:29,783
Yes, you are!

398
00:27:30,794 --> 00:27:32,318
AII right.

399
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:40,933
We are never gonna find him.
He's one guy in a huge city.

400
00:27:41,405 --> 00:27:43,635
Oh, my God. Is that him?

401
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:48,443
That is an oId Chinese woman.

402
00:27:50,113 --> 00:27:52,377
He couId be in disguise, you know.

403
00:27:52,883 --> 00:27:55,909
You know what? You're right.
You're absoIuteIy right.

404
00:27:56,086 --> 00:27:57,951
Wait a minute.

405
00:27:58,855 --> 00:28:00,186
ChandIer!

406
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:04,084
Now you're thinking.

407
00:28:04,261 --> 00:28:06,821
Maybe we're just approaching
this aII wrong.

408
00:28:06,997 --> 00:28:09,329
If you're ChandIer
and you want to hide...

409
00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:13,799
...where is the Iast pIace on Earth
peopIe wouId think you'd go?

410
00:28:13,971 --> 00:28:15,563
So this is your office.

411
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,701
How'd you guys find me?
I knew I shouId've hid at the gym.

412
00:28:22,512 --> 00:28:25,003
-What the heII are you doing?
-Panicking.

413
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:29,380
And using the Internet to try to prove
that I'm reIated to Monica.

414
00:28:32,222 --> 00:28:34,713
-How is she?
-She doesn't know you're gone.

415
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:38,588
And she doesn't have to know.
Come on, we're going home.

416
00:28:38,762 --> 00:28:41,162
-I can't do that.
-Why not?

417
00:28:41,331 --> 00:28:44,528
Because if I go home,
we're gonna become the Bings.

418
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:46,528
I can't be the Bings.

419
00:28:46,703 --> 00:28:48,193
What's wrong with it?

420
00:28:48,372 --> 00:28:50,363
The Bings have horribIe marriages.

421
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,837
They yeII, they fight...

422
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:55,968
...and they use the pooI boy
as a pawn in their se<i>x</i>uaI games.

423
00:28:56,913 --> 00:29:01,748
Have you ever put on a bIack dress
and asked me up to your hoteI room?

424
00:29:01,985 --> 00:29:05,352
-No.
-Then you are neither of your parents.

425
00:29:07,924 --> 00:29:12,361
It's not just their marriage.
Look at yours. Look at everybody's.

426
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:15,521
OnIy PauI Newman
can make marriage work.

427
00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:17,758
And I've met me.
I am no PauI Newman.

428
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:22,871
I don't race cars or make popcorn.
None of my proceeds go to charity.

429
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,930
But Iook, ChandIer...

430
00:29:25,742 --> 00:29:30,042
...right now no one has
a Iower opinion of you than I do.

431
00:29:31,848 --> 00:29:34,476
But I totaIIy beIieve you can do this.

432
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:38,954
I want to. I Iove her so much,
but I'm afraid--

433
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,018
This is too huge.

434
00:29:41,191 --> 00:29:43,216
You're right. It is huge.

435
00:29:43,393 --> 00:29:47,090
So why don't we take it
just a IittIe bit at a time.

436
00:29:47,264 --> 00:29:50,358
Forget getting married for a sec.
Just forget about it.

437
00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:54,300
Can you just come home
and take a shower?

438
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:56,536
WeII, yeah. But then--

439
00:30:00,077 --> 00:30:03,012
We're just gonna go home
and take a shower.

440
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,273
That's not scary, right?

441
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:08,209
Depends on what you mean by ''we.''

442
00:30:09,186 --> 00:30:11,313
-AII right!
-There he is!

443
00:30:11,488 --> 00:30:14,855
Good oId ChandIer
with the homophobic jokes.

444
00:30:15,025 --> 00:30:16,424
So, what do you say?

445
00:30:17,027 --> 00:30:19,188
I'II shower,
but I won't promise anything.

446
00:30:19,363 --> 00:30:24,062
Okay, that's aII we're taIking about.
Okay? Come on, Iet's go home.

447
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:29,365
Who's Mike Smith?

448
00:30:30,307 --> 00:30:32,901
I was sure this was my office.

449
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:37,377
The nights are the hardest.

450
00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:41,911
But then the day comes...

451
00:30:42,085 --> 00:30:44,519
...and that's every bit as hard
as the night.

452
00:30:46,356 --> 00:30:50,122
-Then the night comes again--
-The days and nights are hard, I get it!

453
00:30:50,293 --> 00:30:54,059
I have to start getting ready.
I'm getting married today.

454
00:30:54,931 --> 00:30:57,729
I know. At dusk.

455
00:30:57,901 --> 00:31:00,426
That's such a hard time for me.

456
00:31:01,037 --> 00:31:04,700
I'm gonna put my makeup on.
We have to be at the hoteI in an hour.

457
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,342
-Wait!
-What?

458
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,740
Let's go to Iunch!

459
00:31:09,045 --> 00:31:10,706
I can't go to Iunch!

460
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:12,439
Right.

461
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:17,611
Oh, good God, I've faIIen down.

462
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,853
What's going on?

463
00:31:24,594 --> 00:31:26,289
AII right, honey, Iisten.

464
00:31:27,731 --> 00:31:32,259
When I teII you what I'm about to teII you,
I need you to remember...

465
00:31:32,436 --> 00:31:35,894
...that we are aII here for you
and that we Iove you.

466
00:31:36,072 --> 00:31:38,370
Okay, you're reaIIy freaking me out.

467
00:31:40,343 --> 00:31:42,641
We can't find ChandIer--

468
00:31:43,914 --> 00:31:45,506
--'s vest.

469
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:48,442
We can't find ChandIer's vest.

470
00:31:48,618 --> 00:31:51,314
How can that be?
Wait, are you serious?

471
00:31:53,123 --> 00:31:54,215
Found the vest.

472
00:31:54,391 --> 00:31:58,589
We'II have to keep an eye on it,
make sure we don't Iose it again.

473
00:31:59,596 --> 00:32:02,360
Okay, don't scare me Iike that, okay?

474
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,962
For a minute, I was Iike,
''Oh, my God! The worst has happened!''

475
00:32:12,442 --> 00:32:15,843
I wouId sooner die in this heIIhoIe
than see her back with you!

476
00:32:16,012 --> 00:32:18,105
That can be arranged.

477
00:32:21,785 --> 00:32:24,447
-Let's reset.
-What?! He got me!

478
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,649
Let's take it from there.

479
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:33,262
Are you a IittIe off today?
It's going terribIy sIowIy.

480
00:32:34,598 --> 00:32:38,500
Look, my best friends are getting
married in, Iike, an hour, okay?

481
00:32:38,668 --> 00:32:41,933
And I'm the minister.
PIease, can you puII it together?

482
00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:47,372
Of course. I'm sorry. I'd hate you to miss
anything Iike that on account of me.

483
00:32:47,544 --> 00:32:50,138
-I can do this.
-Thank you. Thank you.

484
00:32:50,313 --> 00:32:52,543
StiII roIIing. And, action.

485
00:32:52,782 --> 00:32:55,842
I wouId sooner die in this heIIhoIe
than see her back with you!

486
00:32:56,019 --> 00:32:58,419
That can be arranged!

487
00:33:01,591 --> 00:33:03,149
SIippery IittIe bugger!

488
00:33:15,972 --> 00:33:17,906
So you two were married, huh?

489
00:33:20,243 --> 00:33:22,871
What happened, you just drift apart?

490
00:33:25,649 --> 00:33:27,776
Do you remember our wedding day?

491
00:33:27,984 --> 00:33:30,919
Did you know I sIept with the best man?

492
00:33:31,087 --> 00:33:32,520
Yes, he toId me.

493
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:35,314
At Ieast I think that was what he said.

494
00:33:35,492 --> 00:33:40,088
It was difficuIt to understand
with his Iegs wrapped around my head.

495
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:47,496
Here comes the bride.

496
00:33:49,973 --> 00:33:53,409
Oh, my God, Monica!

497
00:33:53,843 --> 00:33:56,403
I want to wear this every day.

498
00:33:56,646 --> 00:33:58,637
You Iook so beautifuI.

499
00:34:00,016 --> 00:34:01,745
I'm so happy for me.

500
00:34:05,855 --> 00:34:08,824
-HeIIo?
-Did ChandIer show up yet?

501
00:34:08,992 --> 00:34:12,519
-We got him back. Everything's fine.
-Damn it!

502
00:34:12,696 --> 00:34:15,460
-Where are you?
-I'm stiII on the set.

503
00:34:15,632 --> 00:34:18,601
The wedding is in Iess than an hour.

504
00:34:18,768 --> 00:34:23,603
I know. I'm sorry. The guy's drunk.
They won't Iet me go untiI we get this.

505
00:34:23,773 --> 00:34:27,402
Oh, my God. I'm gonna
have to find another minister.

506
00:34:27,577 --> 00:34:30,171
No, I'm the minister!

507
00:34:30,447 --> 00:34:33,905
Look, put them both on the phone,
I'II marry them right now.

508
00:34:34,651 --> 00:34:36,209
Joey, I have to go.

509
00:34:36,386 --> 00:34:40,083
Don't hang up on me! I'II marry you
and me right now! I have the power!

510
00:34:44,294 --> 00:34:47,457
There you go! You put on a tu<i>x</i>edo!

511
00:34:48,131 --> 00:34:50,065
That wasn't scary, was it?

512
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,060
No.

513
00:34:52,802 --> 00:34:55,896
I'm teIIing you,
just a IittIe bit at a time.

514
00:34:56,406 --> 00:34:58,237
What's the ne<i>x</i>t IittIe bit?

515
00:34:59,442 --> 00:35:01,376
Getting married.

516
00:35:01,578 --> 00:35:06,515
You can do that too.
Just Iike you've done everything eIse.

517
00:35:08,418 --> 00:35:11,785
Yeah, you're right. I can do that.

518
00:35:12,288 --> 00:35:16,224
-E<i>x</i>cuse me for a minute.
-Where you going?

519
00:35:16,426 --> 00:35:20,055
I'm not gonna run away again.
I just want some fresh air.

520
00:35:20,463 --> 00:35:21,930
-Okay.
-Okay.

521
00:35:31,141 --> 00:35:33,666
Oh, fresh air!

522
00:35:35,512 --> 00:35:39,448
-Cover for me.
-Maybe you're overreacting. You do that.

523
00:35:39,616 --> 00:35:41,743
We gotta do something.

524
00:35:41,918 --> 00:35:46,685
Joey won't make it, so I'II Iook around
the hoteI for other weddings.

525
00:35:46,856 --> 00:35:50,622
Don't teII them Monica's pregnant,
because they frown on that.

526
00:35:51,027 --> 00:35:52,016
Okay.

527
00:36:02,672 --> 00:36:07,132
Anastassakis Papasifakis wedding.
E<i>x</i>ceIIent.

528
00:36:09,245 --> 00:36:11,042
CongratuIations.

529
00:36:11,214 --> 00:36:12,909
MazeI tov.

530
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,515
Hi! Oh, great hat.

531
00:36:17,087 --> 00:36:20,614
I need you to perform another wedding.
Can you do that?

532
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:23,759
I don't know.
Are they Greek Orthodo<i>x</i>?

533
00:36:23,927 --> 00:36:25,622
Yeah. Yeah.

534
00:36:25,795 --> 00:36:30,289
They're my friends,
Monica StephanopoIis.

535
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:34,797
And ChandIer AcidophiIus.

536
00:36:38,975 --> 00:36:41,910
Hi. Hi.

537
00:36:43,246 --> 00:36:45,146
Hi.

538
00:36:47,851 --> 00:36:49,751
Has anyone seen ChandIer?

539
00:36:49,919 --> 00:36:53,047
-I thought he was with you.
-He was with me.

540
00:36:53,223 --> 00:36:55,919
We're pIaying a IittIe game.
Hide-and-seek.

541
00:36:56,092 --> 00:36:58,993
You can't ask us, son.
That's cheating.

542
00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:07,530
You're right.
Thanks for keeping me honest, Dad.

543
00:37:07,704 --> 00:37:11,538
He better not come here. He can't see
the bride in her wedding dress.

544
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:16,008
As I recaII, when we got married,
I saw the groom in the wedding dress.

545
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,347
That was after the wedding.
It's not bad Iuck then.

546
00:37:20,517 --> 00:37:22,747
Honey, it isn't good Iuck.

547
00:37:27,056 --> 00:37:30,184
Oh, my God! Monica.

548
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,123
I know!

549
00:37:33,263 --> 00:37:36,596
-How's ChandIer doing?
-Great.

550
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,167
He's doing great.
Don't you worry about ChandIer.

551
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:42,297
Are you okay?

552
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,731
WeII, you're sweating.

553
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:49,369
Out of happiness for you and ChandIer.

554
00:37:49,546 --> 00:37:52,743
These are beads of joy.

555
00:37:53,316 --> 00:37:54,681
That's sweet.

556
00:37:54,851 --> 00:37:56,580
Don't touch me.

557
00:37:57,654 --> 00:38:01,146
-Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
-Yeah.

558
00:38:06,696 --> 00:38:09,358
-What's going on?
-ChandIer's gone again.

559
00:38:09,532 --> 00:38:15,164
Why wouId you pIay hide-and-seek
with someone you know is a fIight risk?

560
00:38:19,075 --> 00:38:22,511
Aaron, you gotta Iet me go.
The guy's hammered.

561
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:27,582
I'm sorry. As Iong as he's here
and conscious, we're stiII shooting.

562
00:38:36,926 --> 00:38:40,726
You wouIdn't happen to have
a very big fork?

563
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:45,128
So I just taIked to the director.

564
00:38:45,301 --> 00:38:48,202
That's it. We're done for the day.

565
00:38:49,205 --> 00:38:50,763
We finished the scene?

566
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:55,604
-You were wonderfuI.
-As were you.

567
00:38:56,546 --> 00:38:59,106
So I got your car. It's right outside.

568
00:38:59,282 --> 00:39:00,909
Why? Are we done for the day?

569
00:39:02,452 --> 00:39:04,886
That's what you toId me.

570
00:39:06,022 --> 00:39:08,286
Thank you. You're weIcome.

571
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,125
No, we gotta go. Come on.
Here we go.

572
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:17,097
Is that my ass?

573
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,071
-There he is!
-What?

574
00:39:28,878 --> 00:39:30,903
You're not getting away this time, mister!

575
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,277
UnIess you want
that ass-kicking we taIked about!

576
00:39:35,551 --> 00:39:37,178
Ross!

577
00:39:39,989 --> 00:39:43,550
I'm serious! You're not
waIking out on my sister!

578
00:39:43,726 --> 00:39:45,591
That's right. I'm not.

579
00:39:45,762 --> 00:39:49,323
-Then where have you been?
-I know about Monica.

580
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,491
-You know?
-What?

581
00:39:52,669 --> 00:39:54,364
I heard you and RacheI taIking.

582
00:39:54,537 --> 00:39:57,335
-What? TaIking about what?
-You don't know?

583
00:39:57,507 --> 00:40:00,943
If somebody doesn't teII me
what's going on right now....

584
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,907
What, you'II ''hi-yah''?

585
00:40:05,048 --> 00:40:06,777
Monica's pregnant.

586
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:10,447
Oh, my God.

587
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,349
Oh, my God.
And you're not freaking out?

588
00:40:14,524 --> 00:40:18,551
I was. Then I went to the gift shop
because I was out of cigarettes.

589
00:40:18,728 --> 00:40:22,027
-Cigarettes?
-Big picture, pIease!

590
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:27,932
So when I was in the gift shop,
that's when I saw this.

591
00:40:29,706 --> 00:40:34,040
And I thought, ''Anything
that can fit into this can't be scary.''

592
00:40:34,677 --> 00:40:37,407
You obviousIy didn't see <i>Chucky III.</i>

593
00:40:38,781 --> 00:40:42,273
But come on, Iook at how cute
and smaII this is.

594
00:40:42,452 --> 00:40:47,185
So I got it to give Monica
so she'd know I was okay.

595
00:40:47,357 --> 00:40:48,790
Dude.

596
00:40:49,459 --> 00:40:52,326
Way to go, son.
I knew you'd find him.

597
00:41:01,704 --> 00:41:04,002
Our IittIe boy is getting married.

598
00:41:04,173 --> 00:41:07,233
Look at you, so handsome.

599
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,640
You Iook beautifuI, Mom.

600
00:41:12,715 --> 00:41:15,081
You Iook beautifuI too, Dad.

601
00:41:18,621 --> 00:41:20,486
I Iove you both.

602
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,781
I'm so gIad you're here.

603
00:41:28,831 --> 00:41:30,196
Are you ChandIer?

604
00:41:30,967 --> 00:41:32,992
Are you Joey?

605
00:41:38,508 --> 00:41:41,068
-This is nice.
-What?

606
00:41:41,244 --> 00:41:45,738
I've never waIked down the aisIe
knowing it can't end in divorce.

607
00:42:01,464 --> 00:42:05,161
I wish your grandmother
had Iived to see this.

608
00:42:05,334 --> 00:42:09,498
-She's right there.
-Not that oId crone. My mother.

609
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:15,339
CongratuIations, darIing.

610
00:42:15,578 --> 00:42:17,637
We Iove you, sweetheart.

611
00:42:21,617 --> 00:42:23,676
You Iook beautifuI.

612
00:42:24,554 --> 00:42:27,045
-Is this new?
-Not now.

613
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:33,895
-Who's this?
-I'm Father Karabasos.

614
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,897
He's Greek Orthodo<i>x</i>.

615
00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:38,494
As are you.

616
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,297
Let us begin.

617
00:42:43,439 --> 00:42:44,667
DearIy beIoved--

618
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:46,138
That's my Iine!

619
00:42:51,714 --> 00:42:54,239
I can take it from here. Thanks.

620
00:42:56,252 --> 00:43:00,188
DearIy beIoved,
I'm sorry I'm a IittIe Iate.

621
00:43:02,725 --> 00:43:05,751
You may be confused by this now...

622
00:43:05,928 --> 00:43:09,762
...but you won't be
MemoriaI Day weekend, 2002.

623
00:43:12,568 --> 00:43:16,265
Let's get started before
the groom takes off again.

624
00:43:22,678 --> 00:43:25,010
We are gathered here today...

625
00:43:25,448 --> 00:43:27,609
...to join this man...

626
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:32,487
...and this woman
in the bonds of hoIy matrimony.

627
00:43:33,422 --> 00:43:38,792
I've known Monica and ChandIer
for a Iong time, and I cannot imagine...

628
00:43:38,961 --> 00:43:42,488
...two peopIe more perfect
for each other.

629
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:49,600
And now, as I've Ieft my notes
in my dressing room...

630
00:43:50,907 --> 00:43:53,467
...we shaII proceed to the vows.
Monica?

631
00:43:55,578 --> 00:43:58,240
-He took off?
-Go on. Go on.

632
00:44:04,253 --> 00:44:08,155
ChandIer, for so Iong...

633
00:44:08,691 --> 00:44:12,320
...I wondered if I wouId ever
find my prince.

634
00:44:12,728 --> 00:44:14,525
My souI mate.

635
00:44:14,697 --> 00:44:17,666
Then three years ago,
at another wedding...

636
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:20,563
...I turned to a friend for comfort.

637
00:44:20,736 --> 00:44:25,833
And instead I found everything that
I'd ever been Iooking for my whoIe Iife.

638
00:44:28,744 --> 00:44:30,473
And now...

639
00:44:31,747 --> 00:44:33,408
...here we are...

640
00:44:34,217 --> 00:44:36,708
...with our future before us.

641
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,680
And I onIy want to spend it with you.

642
00:44:42,158 --> 00:44:43,921
My prince.

643
00:44:44,093 --> 00:44:46,027
My souI mate.

644
00:44:46,462 --> 00:44:48,293
My friend.

645
00:44:51,234 --> 00:44:52,895
UnIess you don't want to.

646
00:44:56,072 --> 00:44:57,562
You go.

647
00:44:59,008 --> 00:45:00,066
ChandIer?

648
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:02,507
No, that's okay.

649
00:45:07,783 --> 00:45:12,277
I thought this wouId be the most
difficuIt thing I ever had to do.

650
00:45:13,723 --> 00:45:18,217
But when I saw you waIking down
that aisIe, I reaIized it's simpIe.

651
00:45:20,863 --> 00:45:22,194
I Iove you.

652
00:45:24,033 --> 00:45:29,266
Any surprises that come our way,
it's okay, because I wiII aIways Iove you.

653
00:45:31,641 --> 00:45:35,338
You are the person I was meant
to spend the rest of my Iife with.

654
00:45:35,878 --> 00:45:38,244
You want to know if I'm sure?

655
00:45:41,751 --> 00:45:44,686
You may now kiss the bride.

656
00:45:48,591 --> 00:45:52,152
I guess by the powers vested in me
by the state of New York...

657
00:45:52,328 --> 00:45:54,853
...and the Internet guys...

658
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,327
...I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

659
00:46:01,504 --> 00:46:04,473
Oh, wait. Do you take each other?

660
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,965
-I do.
-I do.

661

Oh, crap. Okay.

Phoebe found your pregnancy test.

674
00:47:08,137 --> 00:47:10,332
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
