1
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:09,070
I'm Phoebe Buffay, and I have
babies coming out.

2
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,877
Have you started having contractions?

3
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:14,945
Not yet. I heard they really hurt.
Do they?

4
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:17,681
Oh, my God!

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,342
Which of you is the father?

6
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:23,579
None of them are.
The father is my brother.

7
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,691
I'll miss watching you
freak people out like that.

8
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,092
This is for the babies
to look at someday.

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,962
Do you want to say anything
before it starts?

10
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,970
Hi, kids! It's me, Aunt Phoebe.

11
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:45,335
Can't wait to see you.
Please don't hurt me!

12
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,547
What took you so long?

13
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,978
Your cab left when ours did.

14
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,485
We went back because
I forgot my jacket.

15
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,986
You're not wearing one.

16
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,323
Oh, man!
I did it again!

17
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,000
Someone has to call
Frank and Alice.

18
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,468
My mom might
What are you doing?

19
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,801
I've got to get the "before" shot!

20
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,509
The One Hundredth

21
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:12,129
We spoke to the nurse.
The reason your doctor is late...

22
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,391
...is because she's not coming.

23
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,562
She hit her head in the shower.

24
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:21,230
Oh, my God. She's so stupid!

25
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:23,539
Phoebe, it's gonna be okay.

26
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:27,543
I don't see three kids
coming out of your vagina!

27
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,212
Listen. The nurse said
the doctor is wonderful.

28
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,285
He's head of the department.

29
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,083
All right. Oh, dear God, save me!

30
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,452
I'm having my first contraction!

31
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,718
Oh, it's not bad.

32
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:50,433
And so the miracle of birth begins.
And l

33
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:51,692
You okay?

34
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,030
Something hurts.

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,107
It's sympathy pains.
That's so sweet!

36
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,642
I didn't know I cared that much.

37
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,579
I'm Dr. Harad.
I'll be delivering your babies.

38
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:11,120
You'll be in good hands.
I've been doing this a long time.

39
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,757
I'll be back to do your internal.

40
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,155
Just relax, everything looks great.

41
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,990
And also, I love Fonzie.

42
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,827
Did he just say he loves Fonzie?

43
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:26,901
That's what it sounded like.

44
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:28,766
All right.

45
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,140
Am I late?
Nobody came out yet, right?

46
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,144
No, we haven't started yet.
Where's Alice?

47
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,788
Delaware. Until she gets here,
I'll be your coach.

48
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,991
Don't worry. She told me
about the LaMazda stuff.

49
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,419
If you get the babies out
by month's end...

50
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,494
...you get two percent financing.

51
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,363
Monica, you're gonna be
very proud of me.

52
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:03,167
I just got us dates with two
unbelievably cute nurses.

53
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,775
Oh, my!

54
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,942
They're male nurses.

55
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,109
Not in my head.

56
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:14,844
They want to take us out
Saturday night! What do you say?

57
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,558
I don't think so.

58
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,862
What are you talking about?

59
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,861
You've been telling me
to get over Ross and move on.

60
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,160
I'm moving on and so are you.

61
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,860
Why don't you want to go?

62
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,900
Why don't you give me
a good reason...

63
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,475
...and I'll tell you if it's true.

64
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,081
-What?
-Harder than it sounds, isn't it?

65
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,219
You're coming.
And when they get off...

66
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,750
...we'll go get some Jello with them.

67
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,519
There's always room for Jello.

68
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,930
How do you make that dirty?

69
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,725
It's easy.
I can do it with anything.

70
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,535
Grandma's chicken salad....

71
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,845
Get a shot of this.

72
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,348
These are the headlines
when you were born.

73
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:24,284
Now, girl baby, turn away.
And boy babies...

74
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,218
...check it out!

75
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,618
This is what naked women
looked like when you were born.

76
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,456
Now let's dive into the good stuff.

77
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,425
Okay, I'm having another one!

78
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,571
This one doesn't hurt eith
Yes, it does!

79
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,302
I was kind of hoping that was it.

80
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,279
Where are Monica and Rachel, anyway?

81
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,953
A couple of nurses asked them out.

82
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,122
Really? Male nurses?

83
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,314
Yeah, I was bummed too.

84
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,491
So they're going on dates.

85
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,391
-When?
-I think Saturday.

86
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,561
-What's with him?
-Sympathy pains.

87
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:14,336
It was sweet at first, but now I think
he's trying to steal my thunder.

88
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,834
Let's see what we got here.

89
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,671
Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.

90
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,183
This Fonzie person
you keep referring to...

91
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,512
...is that another doctor?

92
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:30,813
Oh, no, no.

93
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,755
Fonzie is the nickname
of Arthur Fonzerelli.

94
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,185
The Fonz.

95
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:39,954
All right.

96
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,300
It's not that weird, is it?

97
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,263
It's very weird!

98
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:53,138
I don't want some guy down there
telling me I'm "dilated-a-mundo."

99
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,348
He doesn't seem to be
impersonating Fonzie

100
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,710
What are you doing?

101
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,453
Why are you defending him?
Just get me another doctor...

102
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,682
...who isn't crazy
and doesn't Fonzie!

103
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,452
Again, it's not

104
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,968
Hey, there you are!

105
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,302
There's something you should know.

106
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,498
Is this about you dating the nurse?
Joey told me.

107
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,201
I am so fine. You and l,
we're just nothing.

108
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,046
Just goofing around.

109
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,755
I was about to tell you
I was getting out of it.

110
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,823
But if we're just "goofing around,"
maybe I will go out with him.

111
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,153
Fine. Maybe I will too.

112
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,090
Hey! Look what I found
in the gift shop.

113
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,733
Get up! Get up! Get up!

114
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,869
This is Dr. Oberman.

115
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,007
He has no strong feelings
about Fonzie...

116
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,344
...or any of the Happy Days gang.

117
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,411
You're going into what grade?

118
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,117
I'm actually a first-year resident.
I graduated early.

119
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,724
Me too.

120
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:20,395
I should have specified
I'd need a grown-up doctor.

121
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,792
Really, I'm fully qualified

122
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,059
Doogie!

123
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,939
Doesn't anybody understand that
I'm going to be having babies soon?

124
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,612
Go, little boy! Go!

125
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,782
Oh, cool. You made him cry!

126
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:49,091
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid
you've got kidney stones.

127
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,659
Well, what else could it be?

128
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,899
It's kidney stones.

129
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:55,890
Or....

130
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,729
Kidney stones.

131
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,806
-lf it was something else?
-Well, that would be "kidney stones."

132
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,445
You're getting there.

133
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,879
These babies are very, very lucky.

134
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,176
They are? Why?

135
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,480
They'll be born
on the Fonz's half-birthday.

136
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,618
Happy Birthday.

137
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,128
Just to clarify...

138
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,990
...I'm not Fonzie.

139
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:38,140
It's a terrific thing that you're having
these babies for Frank and Alice.

140
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,005
No, it is.

141
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,711
Can I tell you a secret?

142
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,649
I want to keep one.

143
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,524
Oh, I'm gonna be on the news.

144
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,022
You must be kidding.

145
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,890
You know you can't keep
one of these babies.

146
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,089
Maybe I can. You don't know.

147
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,327
I do. Frank and Alice will
want to keep all their children.

148
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,972
Maybe not. You know?

149
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,499
Three babies are a handful.

150
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,974
Maybe they'll want to unload one.

151
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,707
I hate to miss an opportunity
because I didn't ask.

152
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,114
Phoebe, no.
This is insane.

153
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,448
Just ask him.

154
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,352
What? Me?

155
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:27,815
I can't ask him!

156
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,393
Do you know how inappropriate
that would be?

157
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,223
All I'm saying is,
just talk to Frank.

158
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,765
Just feel him out.

159
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,564
No. I will not ask Frank
to give you one of his kids.

160
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,499
You're right.

161
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,981
Tell him it's for you.

162
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,944
Feeling better, sweetie?

163
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,916
Maybe a little.

164
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,920
Wish you hadn't seen me throw up.

165
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,687
Me too.

166
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,297
I just heard. What's up?

167
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,364
Kidney stones!

168
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:15,630
Ordinarily, we try to break
the stones up with shock waves.

169
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,241
But they're too close to the bladder.

170
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:22,471
Either we wait for you to pass them
or else go up the urethra

171
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,848
No, no, no, no.
Nothing is going up, okay?

172
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,655
Up is not an option.
What's a urethra?

173
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,988
Are you crazy?

174
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,161
Did you ask him?

175
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,269
No, I haven't had a chance yet.

176
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,132
I'm kind of on a clock here.

177
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,634
Oh, Fonzie.

178
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,547
You know who I always liked?
Mork.

179
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,677
Undo it. Undo it.

180
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,681
Fonzie met Mork.

181
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,892
Mork froze Fonzie.

182
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,229
But Fonzie was already cool.

183
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,338
So he wasn't hurt. Right?

184
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,841
Yeah, that's right.

185
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,277
How you doing?

186
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:31,015
Okay. Doctor says any minute now.

187
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,709
You know, Alice is going
to be here so soon.

188
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,855
You couldn't just do me a favor
and, like, hold them in?

189
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:45,189
Sorry, I'm in the middle of
the last favor you asked me to do.

190
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,866
This is Dan, one of the guys
we're dating on Saturday.

191
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,699
Nice to meet you.

192
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,904
I'm really looking forward
to Saturday night. Really!

193
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,417
So, Dan...

194
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,589
...nurse, not a doctor, huh?

195
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,757
Kind of girlie, isn't it?

196
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:20,164
That's okay. I'm doing this
to get through medical school.

197
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,996
And it didn't feel "girlie"
during the Gulf War.

198
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,666
Sure.

199
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,340
Thanks for doing that for us,
by the way.

200
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,080
Why wait till Saturday?
Are you free tomorrow?

201
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,151
Sure.
I'll get somebody to cover me.

202
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,946
Great!

203
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,124
Hey, you and me, Saturday night?

204
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,350
-No.
-All right, very good!

205
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,124
This is a big one.

206
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,592
Get these things out of me!

207
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,768
Breathe! Breathe through the pain.

208
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,971
I want the drugs, Ross!

209
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,842
I do too! I do too!

210
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,879
Yeah, I love you.
Okay, bye.

211
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,126
That was Alice's mom.
Alice left five hours ago.

212
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,656
She should be here.

213
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,558
She'll make it on time.

214
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,700
So, Frank...

215
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,232
...three babies.
That just seems like a lot, huh?

216
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,299
Not to me.

217
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,200
Fair enough.

218
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,576
You're at ten centimeters.
Time to start having babies.

219
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,549
I want only the father here.

220
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,119
-We love you.
-Good luck.

221
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,190
I need a clamp, a sterile towel
and Channel 31.

222
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,800
What is that?

223
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:08,762
Oh, my God!

224
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,366
Oh, no, no! It's a good one.
Fonzie plays the bongos.

225
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,609
Ready? Time to try pushing.

226
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,712
Ready? Time to try peeing.

227
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:26,253
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
It's almost time to try peeing.

228
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,587
Push. Concentrate on pushing.

229
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,423
I see the head.

230
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,462
Yes, it has a head!

231
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,497
Keep pushing. Come on.

232
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,000
I can't believe somebody's coming out!

233
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,601
There's somebody coming out of you!

234
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,970
-It's my son!
-All right.

235
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,604
Here's your first baby!

236
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:55,813
Yes! We got a baby boy!

237
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,681
Frank Junior, Junior!

238
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,623
How does he look?

239
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,158
So gross!

240
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,633
Okay. You ready to push again?

241
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,164
I already had a baby.
Leave me alone!

242
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,703
Come on, you can do it!
You can do it!

243
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:27,210
Little Leslie's here!
We got another one!

244
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,612
Oh, my God! I can't believe
I have two children.

245
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,523
How scary is that?

246
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:42,691
Come on, little Chandler,
it's time to be born.

247
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,003
He's coming!
Yes, he's coming!

248
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,042
Hey, where's his thing?

249
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,806
Chandler's a girl!

250
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,309
Oh, God! Kindergarten flashback.

251
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,252
They read the sonogram wrong,
because they thought it was a boy.

252
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,550
But Chandler's a girl!

253
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,423
Okay, keep saying it.

254
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,890
-Am I too late?
-No, no. Everything's okay.

255
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,535
There's 30 fingers and 30 toes.

256
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,198
We have our babies?

257
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,701
We have our babies.

258
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,216
Oh, my God!

259
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,893
You did it, man.

260
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,060
Would you like to see them?

261
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,625
They're so small.

262
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,034
-I'll call you tomorrow.
-Great.

263
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,318
Are you really going to date
that nurse man?

264
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,552
You and I are just
"goofing around."

265
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,384
I thought, why not
"goof around" with him?

266
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:20,493
I don't know if you've looked up
"goofing around" in the dictionary.

267
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,393
Well, I have...

268
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,332
...and the technical definition is:

269
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:30,832
Two friends who care a lot
about each other...

270
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,404
...and have amazing sex...

271
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:40,518
...and just want to spend
more time together.

272
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:45,446
But if you have this new
dictionary that gets you mad at me...

273
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,421
...then we have to get you
my original one.

274
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,853
I am so bad at this.

275
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:57,968
-You're better than you think you are.
-Really?

276
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,228
Okay. So if?

277
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:02,363
-Know when to stop.
-I sensed that I should stop.

278
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,598
So we're okay?

279
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:09,044
I'm gonna go tell Dan that
it's not gonna happen.

280
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,516
-Don't do the dance.
-Right.

281
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,857
You're my favorite.

282
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:24,118
-Which one do you have?
-I don't care.

283
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:32,192
Frank and Alice want me to tell you
they're making phone calls.

284
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,738
Did you talk to them
about, you know....

285
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,037
No, honey.

286
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,250
It was a long shot.

287
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,718
You guys? Can I just have
a second alone with the babies?

288
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,741
So here you are.

289
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:24,586
Seems like yesterday I was talking
to you in that petri dish.

290
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,592
Everyone said labor was
the hardest thing.

291
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,856
But they were wrong. This is.

292
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,266
Well, I had the most fun
with you guys.

293
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,636
I wish I could take you home
and see you every day.

294
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,746
I'll settle for being
your favorite aunt.

295
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,112
I know Alice's sister has a pool,
but you lived in me.

296
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,624
Okay, so we're cool.

297
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,763
We're gonna be great.

298
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,299
Little high-fives.

299
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,407
Well, if you're going to cry....

300
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:44,463
Phoebe, we are so proud of you.
You're amazing!

301
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,792
I know.

302
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,834
Does it hurt as bad as they say?

303
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,134
You won't be able to take it.

304
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:57,303
Now that little Chandler is a girl,
what'll they name her?

305
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,074
They'll call her Chandler.

306
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:03,977
Kind of a masculine name,
don't you think?

307
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,682
It works on you.

308
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:12,662
Maybe they can girlie it up a bit,
like Chandlerette.

309
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,366
Alice called her Channy-fanny.

310
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:16,523
Ha-ha, Channy-fanny.
