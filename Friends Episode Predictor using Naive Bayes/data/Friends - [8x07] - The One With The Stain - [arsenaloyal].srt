1
00:00:04,706 --> 00:00:09,710
Oh, my God, you cleaned!
Look at these floors!

2
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:13,715
You did the windows! I have been begging
you for months! And you did, you cleaned.

3
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:19,011
-And nagging works!
-No, I didn't actually do this.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,015
Oh, no. Was I cleaning
in my sleep again?

5
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:24,684
No, it wasn't you.

6
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:28,646
-Well, then, who?
-I got a maid. Yay!

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,736
I hope by "maid" you mean "mistress"
because if some other woman was cleaning..

8
00:00:34,986 --> 00:00:38,531
Now, honey, I know you don't like
to relinquish control.

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,201
"Relinquish" is just a fancy word
for "lose."

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:48,875
She's nice, and she mentioned that she
adored the way you arranged the sponges.

11
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:51,210
Did she really say that?

12
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:55,131
Yes, I distinctly remember because
I thought it was a joke.

13
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:59,510
-Now, just give her a chance, okay?
-Fine, I can do it.

14
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:06,392
-What's the matter?
-Usually when I'm this anxious, I clean.

15
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:51,521
Whose cell phone is that?
It's just so annoying. Everywhere you go.

16
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:54,607
I think it's coming from your bag.

17
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:59,403
I never get calls!

18
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:01,280
Hello?

19
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:07,620
Hi, it's Eric, from the Halloween
party. Ursula's fiance.

20
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,457
Oh, my God, Eric, hi!
Wait, how'd you get this number?

21
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,877
I have a friend who's a cop,
and he got it for me.

22
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:20,132
Wow. What an incredible violation
and wonderful surprise!

23
00:02:20,383 --> 00:02:23,469
Listen, I just.. I thought you should know
I broke up with Ursula.

24
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:26,430
Oh, you did?
He did it, he did it!

25
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,059
-What did he do?
-I'm talking!

26
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:37,275
Anyway, I was wondering if you were
the sort of person who eats lunch?

27
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,069
Are you asking me out?

28
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,782
Because it'd be kind of weird since you
just broke up with my sister.

29
00:02:44,991 --> 00:02:49,662
Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. Bye.

30
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:53,833
No, no. Wait! I was just saying that
so you'd think I was a good person.

31
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,961
Fight for me.

32
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:00,923
I won't take "no" for an answer.

33
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:03,676
Not great, but we can
work on it at lunch.

34
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:07,179
I can be at your apartment
in two hours.

35
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,807
Great. How do you know where I live?

36
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:12,602
I've got friends too.

37
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,061
Okay, bye.

38
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:17,356
Oh, my God, I'm going out with Eric!

39
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:22,194
This day is really gonna be so much better
than I thought it was gonna be.

40
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:25,323
Oh, Ross, I can't make lunch.

41
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,870
So apparently I'm available
for lunch.

42
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:33,706
I can't. I'm busy.
I'm apartment hunting.

43
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:35,374
You're moving?

44
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,669
I can't live with Joey
once the baby comes.

45
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,633
I don't want my child's first words
to be, "How you doing?"

46
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:46,510
So does Joey know you're moving?

47
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,639
I haven't discussed it with him,
but I know he'll be relieved.

48
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:54,769
Last week, he brought this girl over,
and I talked to her about morning sickness.

49
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,355
Then I showed her pictures
from my pregnancy book.

50
00:03:57,563 --> 00:04:01,192
-That's not really porn?
-Not so much.

51
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:07,531
I heard in the elevator this morning
that a woman in my building died.

52
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:13,704
Oh, my God. Was she old?
Does she have a view?

53
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:18,501
I don't know, but how great would that be?
You living in my building?

54
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:22,755
I could take care of the baby,
I could come over whenever I want..

55
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,507
with your permission.

56
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:28,719
That really would be great.
Well, can we see it?

57
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,515
Maybe we shouldn't.
I mean, if she just died this morning.

58
00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:36,060
Yeah. No. No, you're right.

59
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,274
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

60
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:51,367
Yes?

61
00:04:51,575 --> 00:04:54,578
Hi. I'm Ross Geller.
I live in the building.

62
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:59,375
And I'm Rachel,
an admirer of the building.

63
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:05,840
I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing
away, and I am so sorry for your loss.

64
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:08,300
-She didn't pass away.
-What?

65
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:13,139
-My mother's still alive.
-Oh, thank God!

66
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:19,812
It looked like we were gonna lose her
this morning, but she's a tough old bird.

67
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:21,689
Are you close with her?

68
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:26,485
Of course. She and I would
talk all the time..

69
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:29,905
in the laundry room.

70
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:32,742
You speak Dutch?

71
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:42,960
You know, I would,
but it's just too painful.

72
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:46,922
So she's really not dead.

73
00:05:47,131 --> 00:05:50,468
No. She's hanging in there.

74
00:05:50,676 --> 00:05:56,599
Could you tell me, is she hanging in
in a one-bedroom or a two?

75
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:04,231
Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible.
Where did you get it?

76
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,610
Oh, well..
I make it myself.

77
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:13,032
It's two parts ammonia and one part
lemon juice. The secret ingredient is..

78
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,327
You know what? We just met.

79
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:20,539
Okay. I'm gonna go get the clothes
from the laundry room now.

80
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,334
When I come back,
I'll clean behind the refrigerator.

81
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,211
I love her.

82
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:29,465
I'll be back in a minute.

83
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:32,259
Okay.

84
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:36,972
-See? I told you.
-She stole my jeans!

85
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:40,309
What?

86
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,646
I've been looking for them all week,
and she is wearing them.

87
00:06:43,854 --> 00:06:48,400
So she stole your pants and then
came back and wore them in front of you?

88
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:52,613
Don't you see?
It's the perfect crime!

89
00:06:52,863 --> 00:06:55,908
She must have been
planning this for years!

90
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,409
I'll prove it to you, okay.

91
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,748
I dropped a pen in my lap, and it left
an ink stain on the crotch.

92
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:07,586
When she comes back, I will find it
and show you that stain!

93
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:15,553
Isn't it possible the company that sold
the jeans made more than just the one pair?

94
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:16,929
I guess.

95
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:23,269
Shouldn't we give her the benefit of the
doubt before we snoop around her crotch?

96
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:28,107
Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give
her my secret ingredient.

97
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:30,693
Out of curiosity,
what is your secret ingredient?

98
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,111
Yeah.

99
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:41,620
-Hi.
-Come in. I'm so glad you're here.

100
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:42,872
Yeah. Me too.

101
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,458
Not in the shaky, angry way
that you are, though.

102
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:50,921
Sorry. I just saw Ursula.
I had to get the engagement ring back.

103
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,425
Just seeing her brought it all back.

104
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:57,970
All the lies, the way she used me.

105
00:07:58,262 --> 00:08:02,474
I just.. I get so angry,
just looking at her..

106
00:08:05,227 --> 00:08:10,399
-Face.
-Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:15,821
I'm sorry. It's just,
when I look at you..

108
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:18,115
I see her.

109
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:23,954
And when I see her,
I get a little bit angry.

110
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,834
So where do you wanna eat?

111
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:31,921
Not that I'm not enjoying
watching you flip out.

112
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:34,798
Sorry.

113
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:37,009
-Maybe this is too weird.
-Wait.

114
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:41,847
There's only a problem
when I look at you.

115
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,975
I got it. I got it.

116
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:48,270
No, don't tear out your eyes!

117
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:53,150
-I was just gonna take out my lenses.
-Oh, yeah. Try that.

118
00:08:55,527 --> 00:08:57,905
So is that better?

119
00:08:58,113 --> 00:09:00,199
Not really.

120
00:09:01,492 --> 00:09:07,915
You're blurry, but you still
look like Ursula. You're "Blursula."

121
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,712
Okay, wait. Maybe..

122
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:18,342
If I just don't look at you
for a while.

123
00:09:19,969 --> 00:09:26,058
See? It works. I'm not angry at
all anymore. This is a great date!

124
00:09:26,892 --> 00:09:28,727
Yeah, not so much.

125
00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:31,105
It's kind of hard
to have a conversation.

126
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,191
Oh, no.
Sure, we can have a conversation.

127
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,736
Tell me a little
something about yourself.

128
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:41,031
Oh, me?

129
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:44,994
Look, Eric, turn around.

130
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,958
I like you, but it shouldn't be
this hard. This is our first date.

131
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,586
First dates are supposed to be
about excitement and electricity and..

132
00:09:54,795 --> 00:10:00,342
"He just touched my hand,
did he mean to?" and first kisses..

133
00:10:02,386 --> 00:10:04,805
Second kisses.

134
00:10:07,683 --> 00:10:11,061
Thanks for the coffee, or:

135
00:10:21,447 --> 00:10:23,949
Yeah, we're done.

136
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:35,878
Hey, Ross. You wanna go see
that new IMAX movie on tide pools?

137
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:38,172
-Really?
-No.

138
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,968
But I got Knicks tickets
for you, me and Chandler.

139
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:44,553
Sweet!

140
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,972
And then afterwards,
we can go to a strip joint.

141
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:49,016
-Really?
-No.

142
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:52,269
All right, let's go.

143
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,355
I have to stop by my place.

144
00:10:54,563 --> 00:10:59,985
To tape the game? You do this every
time. You're not gonna be on TV!

145
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:03,072
No, I have to see if this apartment
became available.

146
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:06,700
-You're switching apartments?
-It's not for me, it's for Rachel.

147
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:09,995
-She has an apartment.
-When the baby comes, she's gonna move.

148
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:12,206
-She is?
-Yeah.

149
00:11:12,414 --> 00:11:15,918
You didn't expect her
to live there with the baby?

150
00:11:16,168 --> 00:11:18,796
I didn't really think about it.

151
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:27,346
Hey, Gunther, you're an ezel.

152
00:11:30,682 --> 00:11:32,893
Damn it!

153
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,316
-Nice jeans.
-Oh, thanks.

154
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:43,946
-I like your top.
-Oh. You're not getting it.

155
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:55,415
-What happened?
-Oh. I fell asleep!

156
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,128
I was thinking about taking
my lunch break.

157
00:11:59,378 --> 00:12:04,258
Will you do the top of the cabinets?
That'll work up your appetite for lunch.

158
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:06,260
All right.

159
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,285
Hello.

160
00:12:32,244 --> 00:12:33,453
What's going on?

161
00:12:33,871 --> 00:12:38,584
I'm sorry. I've never had a maid
before. Is this not okay?

162
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,129
I don't understand.

163
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:44,798
Why was your head
just between my legs?

164
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,758
That's a fair question.

165
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:50,095
Well, my head was
between your legs..

166
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:53,390
because I find you
very attractive.

167
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:55,934
Are you coming onto me?

168
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:57,311
Apparently.

169
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:01,732
-Hey.
-Hey.

170
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:07,779
-How was the game?
-It was okay. I ate way too much.

171
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:14,578
I was talking to Ross, and he said
you were looking for a new place.

172
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:20,417
Yeah. Hopefully across the street.
If certain Dutch people would just let go.

173
00:13:22,085 --> 00:13:24,922
I was kind of hoping you'd stay.

174
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:28,884
Joey, I have to go.
There's no room for a baby here.

175
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:33,680
No room? It's a baby.
It's, like, this big.

176
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:37,935
You could put it over here.

177
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:41,271
Or we could put it right here.
It's cute, right?

178
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,942
Or put it over here.
You wouldn't even notice it.

179
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,487
"Where's the baby?"
"Oh, it's right over.."

180
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:52,991
Honey, it's not just a matter
of where you put it.

181
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:56,620
A baby changes everything.
They cry all the time.

182
00:13:56,828 --> 00:14:01,625
Imagine bringing home some girl and
trying to score with a screaming baby.

183
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:05,337
I could use a challenge.
It's getting pretty easy.

184
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:09,341
It's so sweet that you want me
to stay, but I can't.

185
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,678
It would disrupt your entire life.

186
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:18,308
It's just..
I love living with you so much.

187
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:22,646
-I wish things didn't have to change.
-I know.

188
00:14:22,854 --> 00:14:25,816
You know, I blame Ross for this.

189
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:29,361
I do too, a little bit.

190
00:14:30,612 --> 00:14:32,948
I'm gonna miss you.

191
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:35,784
You're the hottest roommate
I ever had.

192
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:45,502
Oh, no, I have to go.
I have a massage appointment.

193
00:14:45,711 --> 00:14:49,631
No, stay here. We'll keep doing this.
I'll pay you.

194
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,135
No, I've gotten in trouble
for that before.

195
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:56,847
-I'll see you later?
-Absolutely.

196
00:14:58,348 --> 00:15:00,350
I love the way you kiss.

197
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,230
Really? That's the thing I'm worst at!
You'll see.

198
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,070
Hey.

199
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:16,074
-Hey. I think Brenda needs a raise.
-How come?

200
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:19,077
Because I put my head
between her legs.

201
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:22,205
-To see her pants?
-They're my pants!

202
00:15:22,414 --> 00:15:24,291
Are you sure?
Did you see the stain?

203
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:28,712
No. I was getting into position,
and then everything went dark.

204
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:32,799
She is not stealing from us, okay.
Will you let this go?

205
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,843
Fine.

206
00:15:39,848 --> 00:15:43,685
-She's wearing my bra!
-Oh, dear God!

207
00:15:43,894 --> 00:15:46,605
My pink, flowered bra!
I recognize the strap!

208
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:50,108
Yet you don't recognize
that you're crazy?

209
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:53,945
Here's the plan. I'm going to leave,
and you're gonna look at Brenda's bra.

210
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,948
Here's another plan. No.

211
00:15:57,157 --> 00:16:00,410
I would do it, but she thinks
I'm attracted to her.

212
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:04,247
-Why?
-Did you not hear where my head was?

213
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,876
We're a team.
We're in this together.

214
00:16:08,085 --> 00:16:11,963
I fear a jury will see it
the same way.

215
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:16,468
Do this for me. I catch you looking
at women's breasts all the time.

216
00:16:16,718 --> 00:16:18,887
You see that?

217
00:16:19,137 --> 00:16:20,597
Do you see this?

218
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,560
All right, yes.
Okay. I get your point.

219
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:28,605
But if it's not her bra, will you
just let the woman clean?

220
00:16:28,814 --> 00:16:35,237
Yes. You'll know it's mine because on
the right cup, there's a very noticeable rip.

221
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:39,282
You need new clothes.

222
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:47,082
-Hi. How is she?
-It's not looking good.

223
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:55,674
Well, I brought her some bloemen.

224
00:16:55,924 --> 00:17:01,596
That's so sweet. Would you like to say
goodbye? It would mean a lot to her.

225
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:05,142
Oh, I don't know that it would.

226
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:09,938
-Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
-All right, then.

227
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:20,991
-Hey!
-Welcome back.

228
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:27,122
-Shall we pick up from where we left off?
-I'm still tired from this afternoon.

229
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,541
-Why?
-The sex.

230
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,668
-What sex?
-Our sex.

231
00:17:31,877 --> 00:17:33,211
We didn't have sex.

232
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:38,049
If I didn't have sex with you, I had sex
with somebody that looked like..

233
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:48,727
-You had sex with Ursula?
-A little bit.

234
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:51,980
She walked in, I thought she was you
and I kissed her and..

235
00:17:52,189 --> 00:17:57,486
-You didn't notice different clothes?
-I was just so excited to see you.

236
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,076
-This is too weird.
-No, it's not. I don't wanna lose you.

237
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:09,289
It's like I was saying to Ursula
when I was making love..

238
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,666
Yeah. It's too weird.

239
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,754
So I guess this is it.

240
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:18,048
Yeah.

241
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,468
Maybe it's for the best.

242
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:25,514
-You smell just like her.
-Yeah, so do you.

243
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:48,537
-What are you doing?
-I'm leaning.

244
00:18:48,745 --> 00:18:51,248
This is where I lean.

245
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,917
Okay.

246
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,797
-Brenda, a bee!
-What?

247
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:04,636
It's flown into your blouse, and you better
undo your buttons lest it sting you.

248
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:10,141
-I think I know what's going on here.
-You do?

249
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:14,437
Look, I know it must be hard
that your wife is a lesbian..

250
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:19,025
but it's wrong. You're married.

251
00:19:19,234 --> 00:19:22,487
-I totally understand.
-Okay, good.

252
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:25,407
Could I just see your bra?

253
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:30,620
Hi.

254
00:19:32,414 --> 00:19:35,250
-Where'd you get those jeans?
-You gave them to me.

255
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:39,254
-No, I didn't!
-All right, I took them.

256
00:19:39,462 --> 00:19:43,174
I figured it'd be okay because
you've got a big ink stain on the crotch.

257
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:47,178
-Oh, no! Did you take my bra too?
-What bra?

258
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:52,183
-The pink one with the flowers.
-You mean the one you're wearing?

259
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:57,480
I quit!

260
00:19:58,607 --> 00:20:00,650
Sounds about right.

261
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:08,867
What is this?

262
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:11,661
This is just to give you an idea.

263
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:15,290
We can put screens here
so that the baby has privacy..

264
00:20:15,457 --> 00:20:18,585
and maybe a mobile over the crib..

265
00:20:18,793 --> 00:20:24,716
and here's a baby monitor which, till the
baby comes, we can use as walkie-talkies.

266
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,970
You're so sweet!

267
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,892
Oh, my God!
And you gave the baby Hugsy!

268
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,692
That's really just to show
where the baby would go.

269
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:46,488
Why don't I hold on to him
so there's no confusion.

270
00:20:49,908 --> 00:20:53,787
Joey, the baby is gonna be crying.
It's gonna be loud.

271
00:20:53,995 --> 00:20:56,581
-I'm loud.
-It's gonna be up all night.

272
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,042
-I'm up all night.
-It's gonna poop.

273
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,628
Hello!

274
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:04,756
What about all the women?

275
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:08,718
If I'm bringing home a woman
who can't stand a baby..

276
00:21:08,927 --> 00:21:12,097
then maybe I don't wanna
be with that woman.

277
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:16,017
Or maybe we'll do it
in the bathroom of the club!

278
00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:19,479
But I won't say stuff
like that around the baby.

279
00:21:20,271 --> 00:21:21,815
Joey, are you sure?

280
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:25,902
Yeah. Look, I know sometimes
it'll be hard, okay..

281
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:31,491
but it'll also be really,
really great.

282
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:35,996
Please, Rachel,
I really want you to stay.

283
00:21:37,247 --> 00:21:41,835
I want me to stay too. Thank you.

284
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:48,633
-Joey, look at this crib. It's so cute.
-I know. I found it on the street.

285
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:52,929
Are you..? Really?
This is in such good condition.

286
00:21:53,138 --> 00:21:55,432
Whoa! What's under the cover?

287
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,976
-I don't know.
-It's moving.

288
00:21:58,226 --> 00:22:00,478
It's got a tail! Get it out of here!

289
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:02,313
Okay!

290
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:13,658
Well, the old lady died.
And how do I know?

291
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:17,996
Because her dying wish
was for one last kiss.

292
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,002
And because I'm such a strong,
strapping alleenstaande..

293
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:27,172
I had to carry her body to the lobby.

294
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,216
You know, and she was
not a slight woman.

295
00:22:31,801 --> 00:22:35,847
But I don't care, because
you got the apartment. Yes!

296
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:42,062
Yeah. I think I'm gonna stay here.

297
00:22:42,312 --> 00:22:44,355
Isn't that great?

298
00:22:44,522 --> 00:22:47,150
What..? You..
But.. Bu..
