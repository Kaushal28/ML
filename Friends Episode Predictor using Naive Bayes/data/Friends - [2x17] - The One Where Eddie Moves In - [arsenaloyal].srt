1
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,723
So what do you think?

2
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:10,153
Casa de Joey.

3
00:00:11,395 --> 00:00:13,454
-I decorated it myself.
-Get out!

4
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,460
Wow, Joey, this is....

5
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:20,330
-Art.
-Art it is.

6
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:23,973
Check this out!
Is it a coffee table?

7
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:27,438
Is it a panther?
There's no need to decide.

8
00:00:29,513 --> 00:00:31,447
Hey, nice pillow.

9
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:34,511
So tell me,
is this genuine Muppet skin?

10
00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:38,749
Hey, excellent water, table thing.

11
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,254
Thanks. I love this.
But you know what?

12
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,517
It makes me want to pee.

13
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:47,296
Yeah, me too.
I think that's the challenge.

14
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,862
How come Chandler didn't come?

15
00:00:53,937 --> 00:00:56,030
It's because he had
a thing with the...

16
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:57,297
...with the thing.

17
00:00:59,943 --> 00:01:01,433
Right. I got it.

18
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:05,880
So why don't you show us
the rest of your casa?

19
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,384
The best part! Come on.

20
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:20,019
Nice toilet.

21
00:01:20,464 --> 00:01:21,954
No, no, no. Behind it.

22
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,828
-You have a phone in here?
-That's right.

23
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:26,297
I have a phone.

24
00:01:26,537 --> 00:01:27,868
In here.

25
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,337
Joey, promise me something.

26
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:33,806
Never call me from that phone.

27
00:01:34,878 --> 00:01:36,903
The One Where Eddie Moves ln

28
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,494
Okay, here we go.

29
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,434
Sorry, they were all out of apple pie.
Someone just got the last piece.

30
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:41,441
Oh, my God!
You won't believe this!

31
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:44,440
I have just been discovered.

32
00:02:45,652 --> 00:02:49,588
Wait a minute. I claimed you
in the name of France four years ago.

33
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:54,316
Anyway.

34
00:02:54,628 --> 00:02:58,291
Don't freak out and say how
great this is until I'm done.

35
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:02,993
I just met this producer
of this teeny record company...

36
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,205
...who said that I have
a very fresh, offbeat sound...

37
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,637
...and she wants to do
a demo of "Smelly Cat."

38
00:03:11,678 --> 00:03:13,805
Okay, I told you not to do that yet.

39
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:17,948
And she wants to do a video.

40
00:03:19,686 --> 00:03:21,847
I'm not done yet, okay?

41
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:23,213
God!

42
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:28,693
If that goes well,
they may even want to make an album.

43
00:03:31,698 --> 00:03:32,528
I'm done now.

44
00:03:36,536 --> 00:03:39,972
If you care about me,
get the pie out of the man's hood.

45
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:42,903
-Get the what?
-There's a pie in the hood. Go!

46
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,980
What are you doing?

47
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:54,085
I'm sorry.
My pie was in your hood.

48
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,381
I have to get the coffee
out of that guy's pants...

49
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,094
...and I'll be back
in the hospital by 7.

50
00:04:08,168 --> 00:04:11,501
Damn it, Ross!
Get your butt out of the bathroom!

51
00:04:12,205 --> 00:04:14,867
Calm down. I'm blow-drying.

52
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:18,377
Blow-drying what?
You have no hair.

53
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:20,870
What's going on?

54
00:04:21,114 --> 00:04:23,548
Your boyfriend has been
in there for an hour!

55
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,615
It's like I'm living with him again.

56
00:04:25,852 --> 00:04:29,686
He's here when I go to sleep and
wake up and when I want to shower.

57
00:04:29,923 --> 00:04:31,686
I feel like I'm 16 again.

58
00:04:31,892 --> 00:04:34,759
Well, you're not 16.
You're both adults now.

59
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:36,929
Get out, you doofus!

60
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,794
Or, you know,
he's rubber and you're glue.

61
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:47,706
All yours.

62
00:04:48,642 --> 00:04:51,372
I hope you cleaned your hair
out of the drain.

63
00:04:53,814 --> 00:04:54,644
Shut up!

64
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,542
Cut it out!

65
00:05:03,957 --> 00:05:06,152
I've never wanted you more.

66
00:05:40,152 --> 00:05:43,152
-Lui. Where is Howard?
-He went home.

67
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,552
He said he might stop by after a shift.

68
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:49,152
He said he tell you he don't feel so good.

69
00:05:51,152 --> 00:05:53,152
Hey what time do you get off?

70
00:05:54,552 --> 00:05:56,552
I'm not feel too good either.

71
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:07,070
So what do you say, boys?
Should I call him?

72
00:06:13,646 --> 00:06:15,045
You know what they say:

73
00:06:15,314 --> 00:06:17,509
Ask your slippers a question...

74
00:06:18,851 --> 00:06:20,580
...you're going crazy.

75
00:06:37,595 --> 00:06:40,086
I'm sorry I didn't make it
over there today.

76
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:42,295
That's okay.

77
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,261
You had a thing.

78
00:06:45,102 --> 00:06:46,763
I hear the place looks great.

79
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:50,574
Forget about it.
I'm having a ball!

80
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:52,402
How's the apartment?

81
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:56,109
It's terrific.
I mean, it's a regular space-...

82
00:06:57,648 --> 00:06:58,740
...-fest!

83
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:02,642
Well, great.

84
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,852
Yeah, I just...

85
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:06,689
...wanted to call and say hey.

86
00:07:08,392 --> 00:07:09,324
Well, okay.

87
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:12,194
Was that the oven timer?

88
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,261
That's right, my friend.

89
00:07:14,932 --> 00:07:16,365
It's time for...

90
00:07:16,634 --> 00:07:17,532
...Baywatch!

91
00:07:21,772 --> 00:07:24,138
Can you believe they gave
Stephanie skin cancer?

92
00:07:24,508 --> 00:07:26,840
I can't believe
they made her lieutenant!

93
00:07:28,546 --> 00:07:31,276
You're saying that because
you love Yasmine Bleeth.

94
00:07:31,482 --> 00:07:34,383
How could anyone
not love Yasmine Bleeth?

95
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,782
Hey, they're running.

96
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,023
See, this is the
brilliance of the show.

97
00:07:42,393 --> 00:07:44,122
I say always keep them running.

98
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,461
All the time running!

99
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,223
Run!

100
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:51,457
Run!

101
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:54,331
Run, Yasmine! Run like the wind!

102
00:07:56,374 --> 00:07:58,308
But you wanted to live by yourself.

103
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:01,067
I did. I thought it'd be great.

104
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:04,577
I figured I'd have time alone
with my thoughts.

105
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:08,307
But it turns out I don't have
as many thoughts as you think.

106
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,755
Why don't you talk to Chandler
about moving back?

107
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,924
You really think he'd take me?

108
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:17,093
We had a good talk last night...

109
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:19,556
...but when I moved out,
I hurt him bad.

110
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,321
He would definitely want you back.

111
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:25,626
I'm telling you,
there's no way he's moving back.

112
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:29,363
But we had one of the greatest talks
we ever had last night.

113
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,269
I mean, it was

114
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:34,444
It was like when we first
started living together.

115
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,712
I know you don't want
to hear this right now...

116
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:41,883
... but we've seen him
in his new place. And he's happy.

117
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,578
He's decorated.

118
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:50,051
Chandler, he has moved on, okay?
You have to, too.

119
00:08:50,294 --> 00:08:54,025
You'll have to accept the fact
that you're just friends now.

120
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:55,630
You're not...

121
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,358
... roommates anymore.

122
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,561
Okay, Phoebe.
You ready to try one?

123
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:08,401
Smelly cat, smelly cat

124
00:09:08,646 --> 00:09:11,376
What are they feeding you?

125
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:15,079
Smelly, smelly, smelly
Really bad smelling smelly cat

126
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:16,411
Whoa! Oh, my God!

127
00:09:19,957 --> 00:09:21,720
I mean, like, who was that?

128
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:27,758
They're your backup singers.
Behind you, hon.

129
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,732
I thought they were just watching me.

130
00:09:31,969 --> 00:09:34,267
Like at an aquarium, you know?

131
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:37,472
You are so good, hi, you are so good.

132
00:09:37,472 --> 00:09:38,461
All right.

133
00:09:40,461 --> 00:09:43,708
Now everyone knows everyone.
Let's try it again.

134
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,141
From the top.

135
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:48,608
Smelly cat, smelly cat

136
00:09:48,814 --> 00:09:51,783
What are they feeding you?

137
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,022
Okay, sorry.

138
00:09:58,457 --> 00:09:59,856
I'm just not getting...

139
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:02,058
...that everyone gets...

140
00:10:02,294 --> 00:10:05,786
... how smelly
this cat actually is.

141
00:10:06,164 --> 00:10:07,859
Maybe if we could talk about this...

142
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:11,625
... because I need to feel
that you really care about the cat.

143
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:15,036
We can talk.

144
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,175
It's just that this costs
$100 a minute to be in here.

145
00:10:18,977 --> 00:10:22,242
So the cat stinks,
but you love it. Let's go.

146
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:26,682
No, there is no way
he was a velociraptor.

147
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,749
Look at the cranial ridge, okay?

148
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:32,319
If Dino was a velociraptor,
he'd have eaten the Flintstones.

149
00:10:35,494 --> 00:10:36,654
Were you taking a nap?

150
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:37,829
I was.

151
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,663
Tony, can you hold on?
That's the other line.

152
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:46,037
Yeah, she's here,
but can she call you back?

153
00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:47,771
Okay, thanks.

154
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,097
Call Joanna.

155
00:10:49,341 --> 00:10:50,365
Did she leave a number?

156
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,907
Did you see me write one down?

157
00:10:54,346 --> 00:10:56,439
I don't have her number, butt-munch.

158
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,745
She'll call back.
Don't be such a baby.

159
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,283
You're the baby.

160
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:04,782
-Get off my back.
-Get out of my face.

161
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:07,685
Wait, hold on, Tony. Hold on.

162
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:14,057
Yeah, she's right here.
Hold on.

163
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,533
Tony, can I call you back?

164
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:19,202
That's my sister's boyfriend.

165
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:21,094
Give me that.

166
00:11:24,276 --> 00:11:28,144
Sweetie, before I forget, did l
leave my diaphragm at your place?

167
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:30,945
Hi, Mom.

168
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:55,397
So how's the palace?

169
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:59,866
It's funny you should mention that
because I was thinking....

170
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:02,176
What's with the boxes?

171
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:06,516
Actually, I have some news.

172
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:10,515
Is that Joey guy gonna pick up
his moose hat or should I toss it?

173
00:12:11,557 --> 00:12:15,459
Why don't you ask him yourself?
This is my new roommate, Eddie.

174
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:16,786
Nice to meet you.

175
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,792
-Likewise.
-How you doing?

176
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,127
I'll take that.

177
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:23,628
It's what I came for.

178
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:27,465
This is new.
Where'd you two meet?

179
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:31,368
At the supermarket
in the ethnic food section.

180
00:12:31,643 --> 00:12:33,474
I helped him pick out a chorizo.

181
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:40,276
We got to talking. He needed
a place, and I had a spare room.

182
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:42,881
Now it's a spare room?

183
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:45,985
Well, yeah.
In that it's not being used...

184
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,054
...and I have it to spare.

185
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:52,826
Well, I got what I came for.

186
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:57,801
I'll see you.

187
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:00,796
Hey, Joe.

188
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:03,964
When'd you start using
moose in your hair?

189
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,470
Is this guy great, or what?

190
00:13:09,948 --> 00:13:11,313
Yeah, he is.

191
00:13:18,624 --> 00:13:20,922
I can't believe he has
a new roommate. Who is he?

192
00:13:21,126 --> 00:13:22,855
Eddie. He just met him.

193
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:26,553
It'll never last.
He's just a rebound roommate.

194
00:13:30,402 --> 00:13:32,461
Check it out! Check it out!

195
00:13:32,704 --> 00:13:34,638
It's "Smelly Cat," the video!

196
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:41,573
Now, I haven't seen it yet,
so if you don't like it...

197
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,305
...so what?
None of you ever made a video.

198
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:56,484
Get out of here, cat! You stink!

199
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:05,461
Smoking!

200
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:06,638
Look at me!

201
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:09,465
Smelly cat, smelly cat

202
00:14:10,342 --> 00:14:13,175
What are they feeding you?

203
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:17,106
Smelly cat, smelly cat

204
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:20,011
It's not your fault

205
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:26,580
Smelly, smelly, smelly
Really bad smelling smelly cat

206
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,452
It's not your fault

207
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:31,493
Smelly cat, smelly cat

208
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:33,824
-Oh, my God!
-I know.

209
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:36,090
I sound amazing!

210
00:14:39,438 --> 00:14:41,804
They won't take you to the vet

211
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,338
You're obviously not their favorite pet

212
00:14:44,543 --> 00:14:47,034
Smelly cat, smelly cat

213
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,144
It's not your fault

214
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,815
I've never heard myself sing before.

215
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,284
I mean, except in my own head.

216
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,651
This is so cool!
Now I can hear what you hear!

217
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:04,552
Pretty different, huh?

218
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:08,527
I am sorry,
but I'm incredibly talented!

219
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:13,031
Smelly cat, smelly cat

220
00:15:13,238 --> 00:15:15,570
It's not your fault

221
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:27,880
What's going on, man?

222
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:28,917
Eddie.

223
00:15:29,288 --> 00:15:30,118
Morning.

224
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:35,185
I just came by to pick up my mail.

225
00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:38,790
-Where's the mail?
-Over there on the table.

226
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:41,590
You don't keep it
on this table anymore?

227
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:43,425
Eddie likes it over there.

228
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:51,236
All right, here you go, my friend.
Eggs a la Eddie.

229
00:15:56,448 --> 00:15:58,109
That's great.

230
00:16:00,452 --> 00:16:01,476
What?

231
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,551
I thought you liked your eggs...

232
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:07,054
...with the bread with the hole
in the middle, a la me!

233
00:16:07,493 --> 00:16:11,224
I do, but Eddie makes them this way.
They're pretty darn good.

234
00:16:11,224 --> 00:16:12,630
Will you try some, there are some extra.

235
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:13,930
-No, thanks!
-All right.

236
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,722
Well, you guys...

237
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:18,157
... I'm out of here.

238
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:19,766
See you, pals.

239
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:20,936
See you.

240
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:27,601
-How are you two getting along?
-I couldn't be happier.

241
00:16:28,277 --> 00:16:29,301
Great.

242
00:16:29,678 --> 00:16:31,305
I'm happy for you.

243
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,908
All right, that's it!

244
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:40,984
He just comes in here,
Mr. Johnny New Eggs...

245
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:47,153
...with his moving the mail
and his "See you, pals."

246
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:51,193
And now there's no juice!

247
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:55,131
There's no juice for the people
who need the juice. I need the juice!

248
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:58,636
There's another carton there.

249
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:03,341
This isn't about juice anymore,
all right, man?

250
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:04,710
All right.

251
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,004
So what's it about?

252
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:07,145
Eggs!

253
00:17:08,384 --> 00:17:11,114
Whose eggs do you like better,
his or mine?

254
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,982
-Well, I like both eggs equally.
-Oh, come on!

255
00:17:14,557 --> 00:17:18,857
Nobody likes two eggs equally.
I wanna know which one you like better.

256
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:21,688
What's the difference?
Your eggs aren't here anymore.

257
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:25,730
You took your eggs and you left!

258
00:17:26,168 --> 00:17:28,796
Did you expect me
to never find new eggs?

259
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:32,796
Maybe this is not about the eggs.

260
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:35,696
Maybe it's about the chicken that lay them.

261
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:40,796
What chicken, there is no chicken.

262
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:43,340
I can't talk to you.

263
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,035
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.

264
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:52,869
Tough. We're watching
Predators of the Serengeti.

265
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:55,373
Would you guys stop!

266
00:17:55,581 --> 00:17:57,481
It's my TV!

267
00:17:57,816 --> 00:18:00,046
-Quit it!
-Bite me!

268
00:18:00,352 --> 00:18:03,014
Monica keeps changing the channel.

269
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:05,985
That's great.
Why don't you tell Mommy on me?

270
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:09,258
Now I'm Mommy in this little play?

271
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:11,553
Look, I refuse to get sucked into...

272
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:15,028
...this weird little Geller
dimension thing, okay?

273
00:18:15,234 --> 00:18:18,203
So I'm gonna go take
a nice long hot bubble bath...

274
00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:21,338
...because you kids
are driving me crazy!

275
00:18:24,209 --> 00:18:25,733
What do we do about this?

276
00:18:25,944 --> 00:18:27,912
We could tape Entertainment Tonight.

277
00:18:28,113 --> 00:18:29,080
Not that!

278
00:18:29,348 --> 00:18:31,111
This! Us!

279
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,850
Oh, my God, Ross, it's....
You're just....

280
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:36,680
Since you've been here,
you're driving me....

281
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:39,949
Mon, you've gone ultrasonic
again, all right?

282
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,585
I just can't stand you being here...

283
00:18:43,795 --> 00:18:44,853
...all the time!

284
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:48,294
Why? Why can't you
stand me being here?

285
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:49,728
We're just having fun.

286
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:52,597
Fun? You think this is fun?

287
00:18:53,939 --> 00:18:57,431
I thought we were fooling around,
like when we were kids.

288
00:18:57,643 --> 00:18:59,474
I hated you when we were kids!

289
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,438
You hated me when we were kids?

290
00:19:03,982 --> 00:19:04,949
I hated you.

291
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,618
I loved you in a you're-my-brother-
so-l-have-to way...

292
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:09,787
... but basically, I hated your guts.

293
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,550
Why did you hate me?

294
00:19:12,758 --> 00:19:15,727
Because you were mean to me...

295
00:19:15,928 --> 00:19:19,295
...and you teased me
and you always got your way.

296
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:22,657
That wasn't fun for you?

297
00:19:27,005 --> 00:19:28,905
I can't believe you hated me.

298
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:32,639
But now I love you.

299
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,648
And not just because I have to.

300
00:19:37,316 --> 00:19:38,305
Really?

301
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:43,617
You're just gonna have
to stop pissing me off.

302
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,518
I can do that.

303
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:52,455
Then I won't have to kill you.

304
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:59,126
So you wanna watch
Entertainment Tonight?.

305
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:00,430
Thanks.

306
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:05,169
You know what?

307
00:20:06,845 --> 00:20:10,372
If you really wanna watch
that Serengeti thing, we can.

308
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:22,626
Listen, you are not
going to believe this...

309
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:26,293
...but that is not me
singing on the video.

310
00:20:30,702 --> 00:20:32,192
How did you find out?

311
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:36,840
The record company sent this paper
for me to sign saying it's okay...

312
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:40,637
...for someone else to sing for me.
That was my first clue.

313
00:20:41,747 --> 00:20:42,805
What will you do?

314
00:20:43,048 --> 00:20:45,482
I can't work with people
who would do this.

315
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:46,875
Sure.

316
00:20:47,085 --> 00:20:48,518
I mean, this poor woman.

317
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:50,685
What woman?

318
00:20:50,922 --> 00:20:52,184
The voice woman.

319
00:20:52,424 --> 00:20:55,257
She has a great voice,
but she doesn't have a video.

320
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:58,188
Okay, Pheebs, but what about you?

321
00:20:58,397 --> 00:21:00,365
I have a video. Pay attention.

322
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:06,898
This voice woman, she's so talented.

323
00:21:07,105 --> 00:21:12,042
But according to the producer people,
she doesn't have the right look.

324
00:21:12,344 --> 00:21:15,074
She's like one of those
animals at the pound...

325
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,748
...who nobody wants
because they're not pretty.

326
00:21:18,016 --> 00:21:22,385
Or you know, like some old dog
who's kind of like stinky and

327
00:21:22,621 --> 00:21:24,589
Oh, my God! She's "smelly cat"!

328
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:30,094
That song has so many levels.

329
00:21:32,898 --> 00:21:33,796
Hey, Eddie.

330
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:36,097
You wanna play some foosball?

331
00:21:36,301 --> 00:21:38,929
No, thanks, man.
I'm not really into sports.

332
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:46,372
Yeah, okay. All right.

333
00:21:48,213 --> 00:21:51,114
Doesn't matter.
Time for Baywatch!

334
00:21:52,984 --> 00:21:54,281
You like that show?

335
00:21:56,955 --> 00:21:57,979
You don't?

336
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:03,118
It's just pretty people
running around on the beach.

337
00:22:03,895 --> 00:22:05,920
That's the brilliance of it.

338
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,096
The pretty people.

339
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,994
And the running.

340
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,807
I'm gonna go read in my room
for a little while.

341
00:22:19,111 --> 00:22:20,510
Okay, man.

342
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:34,925
I think of all the friends I've known

343
00:22:37,362 --> 00:22:40,525
But when I dial the telephone

344
00:22:43,602 --> 00:22:45,763
No one's home

345
00:22:53,845 --> 00:22:58,782
All by myself

346
00:23:00,318 --> 00:23:01,945
Don't wanna live

347
00:23:02,187 --> 00:23:06,351
All by myself

348
00:23:07,325 --> 00:23:09,316
Anymore

349
00:23:10,462 --> 00:23:14,489
All by myself

350
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:21,489
I'm gonna sort off with a little song called smelly cat.

351
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:26,489
For those of you who wondering this is my real voice.

352
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:30,931
Smelly cat, smelly cat

353
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:34,071
What are they feeding you?
Everybody!

354
00:23:34,274 --> 00:23:37,107
Smelly cat, smelly cat

355
00:23:37,377 --> 00:23:39,572
It's not your fault

356
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:42,638
They won't take you to the vet

357
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,480
You're obviously not
their favorite pet

358
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,052
You may not be a bed of roses

359
00:23:53,393 --> 00:23:56,760
And you're no friend
To those with noses

360
00:23:57,397 --> 00:24:00,924
Ross, those are the only lines we have.
Back to the chorus!
