1
00:00:05,081 --> 00:00:06,499
-Hi!
-Hey!

2
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:10,086
So, what's the final head count
on my baby shower?

3
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:13,172
About twenty. Couple people
from work had something else to do.

4
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:15,299
Your sisters called and can't make it.

5
00:00:15,508 --> 00:00:18,177
What? You mean they're not coming
to a social event..

6
00:00:18,344 --> 00:00:22,598
where there's no men and no booze?
That's shocking.

7
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:24,725
I don't care, as long as my mom's here.

8
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:28,896
-Oh, my God. Your mother.
-What? My mom's not gonna be here?

9
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:33,734
Well, given that we forgot to invite her,
it would be a big coincidence if she was.

10
00:00:34,193 --> 00:00:36,195
My God!

11
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:39,157
Phoebe was in charge
of the invitations.

12
00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:42,034
I don't have a mother.
So often I forget..

13
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:44,620
Oh, give it a rest.

14
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:48,040
So my mother is not coming
to my baby shower?

15
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:49,584
No.

16
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:52,879
Neither is mine.

17
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:57,550
We'll take care of it. We'll call her.
You go home and get ready.

18
00:00:57,717 --> 00:01:01,220
Make sure she comes.
It's important. It's my mom.

19
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:04,557
-I know. What's her number?
-I don't know.

20
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:07,727
Go. I have it in my book. Go.

21
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:17,278
If you're in charge of invitations,
why am I calling her?

22
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:20,573
Hello, Mrs. Green!
Hi, it's Monica Geller.

23
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,408
-Oh, hello, Monica.
-Hi.

24
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:26,454
It's last-minute, but we've decided
to throw an impromptu..

25
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:30,625
-baby shower for Rachel today.
-My daughters told me..

26
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:35,421
when they received their impromptu
invitations a month ago.

27
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,217
-Okay, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-For what, dear?

28
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:42,428
For not inviting me,
or for lying about it?

29
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:46,724
Oh, my God! My ass is sweating.

30
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:49,060
I'm sorry for everything.
Really, I mean..

31
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:51,604
there's a lot of planning
in a baby shower.

32
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:54,440
You know, things get
overlooked and..

33
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:56,859
Phoebe's mother killed herself.

34
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,279
Why? Did you forget
to invite her too?

35
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:04,492
Oh, you're so funny.

36
00:02:05,827 --> 00:02:09,956
Please, please, can you come?
It starts at 4:00.

37
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:14,627
-Well, all right. I'll see you at 4.
-Thank you.

38
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:20,591
-Isn't it at 3?
-Son of a bitch!

39
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,839
Hey, Joe! Wanna shoot some hoops?

40
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:02,842
And for the record, I am not
covering the tall one this time.

41
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:05,636
Fine, but she's not that tall.

42
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:10,474
I can't go. I'm practicing. I got an audition
to be the host of a new game show.

43
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:11,684
-Cool!
-Great!

44
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:15,104
If I get it, by day
I'll be Dr. Drake Ramoray.

45
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:19,317
But by night I'll be Joey Tribbiani!

46
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:22,403
You'll be perfect for this!
That's already your name!

47
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,821
I know. I know.

48
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:27,617
It'd be great if I got this because you
never know what could happen on a soap.

49
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:29,702
But I could be
a game-show host forever.

50
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:34,790
Like that Bob Barker guy. He's been
doing The Price is Right for 75 years.

51
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,752
I bet the ratings weren't good
for the first 25.

52
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,837
You know, before there was television.

53
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:44,133
But the problem,
this game is really complicated.

54
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,053
Come on. You said the same thing
about Hungry Hungry Hippos.

55
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:49,055
And last week, you beat Ben.

56
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:52,391
Yeah. I have to be
honest with you guys.

57
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:54,310
He kind of let me win.

58
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:58,272
The audition's in a couple hours,
and I don't understand the game.

59
00:03:58,606 --> 00:03:59,899
Do you want some help?

60
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:04,737
Oh, really? That'd be great.
Hey, you guys can be the contestants!

61
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:08,366
We can lose to junior-high girls
some other time.

62
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,786
All right. Let's play Bamboozled!

63
00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:13,913
-Bamboozled?
-Yeah. Isn't that a cool name?

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,289
-Yeah!
-No!

65
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:19,794
All right. Okay.
Our first contestant is Ross Geller.

66
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:22,213
Tell us about yourself, Ross.

67
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,093
Well, I'm a paleontologist.
I live in New York.

68
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:32,139
I have a son, Ben. Hi, Ben! And..

69
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:35,810
I said, a little bit, Ross.
How about you, Chandler?

70
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:39,980
I'm a headhunter. I hook up
out-of-work Soviet scientists..

71
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:43,442
with rogue Third World nations.
Hi, Rasputin.

72
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:47,321
Excellent! Let's play!
Chandler, you'll go first.

73
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,324
-What is the capital of Colombia?
-Bogota.

74
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:53,619
It's Bogota, but close enough.

75
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:59,166
You can either pass your turn to Ross
or pick a Wicked Wango Card.

76
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:03,462
-What does a Wicked Wango Card do?
-I should know that.

77
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,966
Let's see. One moment, please..

78
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:13,431
Here we are. A Wicked Wango Card
determines if you go higher or lower.

79
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:15,933
Higher or lower than what?

80
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:21,439
-This is embarrassing!
-Can you believe how lame this is?

81
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:26,986
I'm sorry. I don't believe contestants
are allowed to talk to each other.

82
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:34,660
I told the stripper to be here at 5.
That's good, right?

83
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,165
You ordered a stripper for the shower?
That is inappropriate.

84
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:42,168
Why? He's gonna be dressed as a baby.

85
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:47,006
Oh, hi, Mrs. Green.
I'm so glad you could make it.

86
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:51,969
Thank you so much. We're so sorry.
We could not feel worse about it.

87
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:53,679
Try.

88
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:56,682
There's my little girl!

89
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,518
-She's still mad.
-Yeah, I know.

90
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:02,897
Isn't it great? One less
person to make small talk with.

91
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,190
Hey, how are you?

92
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,233
Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.

93
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:12,281
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too.
It doesn't bother you?

94
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,202
We've apologized twice.
I can't do any more than that.

95
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:19,121
You hate it when people
are mad at you..

96
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:22,416
but you just have
to be okay with it.

97
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,920
Okay. I can do that.

98
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:29,381
-I gotta go powder my ass.
-Oh.

99
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:32,676
Look at that face! Just like when
you were in high school.

100
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:37,264
If I didn't know better, I'd say
you were a cheerleader in trouble.

101
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,141
-Come, let's get some tea.
-Okay.

102
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:42,478
Oh, my! Look at that.
Only three weeks to go.

103
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:47,399
Did you pick a nanny? If you use your
housekeeper, it will split her focus.

104
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:52,196
Actually, I'm not gonna use a nanny.
And I don't have a housekeeper.

105
00:06:52,404 --> 00:06:55,407
It's like you're a cave person.

106
00:06:55,825 --> 00:07:00,246
You must get a nanny. You don't
know how overwhelming it will be.

107
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:03,707
When you were a baby, I had Mrs. K.

108
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:07,962
Mrs. K! Oh, yeah, she was sweet.
She taught me Spanish.

109
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:10,881
I actually think
I remember some of it.

110
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:14,844
Tu madre esta loca.

111
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:18,055
Such a sweet woman.

112
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:20,808
And more important,
she became a part of our family.

113
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:24,103
That's right, Mrs. K.
What did that K stand for?

114
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,564
I have no idea, dear.
She was the nanny.

115
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:30,234
As great as she was,
I can't afford that.

116
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:34,405
I'm sorry. Sometimes I forget
not everyone has alimony.

117
00:07:36,615 --> 00:07:38,450
-Oh, Rachel!
-What?

118
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:42,580
I just had a great idea!
I'm gonna come live with you!

119
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:45,249
What? What?

120
00:07:45,457 --> 00:07:50,129
Oh, I'm so happy I'm gonna
do this for my little girl.

121
00:07:50,296 --> 00:07:53,757
Look at you.
You have tears in your eyes.

122
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:58,095
Yes, yes, I do.

123
00:07:59,805 --> 00:08:01,223
Ross, you're in the lead.

124
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:04,727
Would you like to take another question
or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?

125
00:08:04,935 --> 00:08:08,647
The Wheel has not been
my friend tonight, Joey.

126
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,649
I'll take another question.

127
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,027
Okay. This is gonna be tough.
Hold your breath.

128
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:14,987
It's okay. I'm ready.

129
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:18,157
You gotta hold your breath
until you answer.

130
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:21,327
This is ridiculous! He's not gonna hold his..

131
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:28,959
Okay. What do you have a fear of if
you suffer from this phobia? Triska..

132
00:08:29,126 --> 00:08:33,213
Holy cow. That's a big word. Trisk..

133
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,883
Look at this. How do you say that?

134
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,136
-Let me see that.
-This one right here.

135
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:43,015
-Triskaidekaphobia.
-Fear of Triscuits!

136
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:47,561
-No! No. Fear of the number 13.
-Fear of Triscuits?

137
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:51,231
It's possible.
They have really sharp edges.

138
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,068
Chandler, you're up.

139
00:08:54,276 --> 00:08:57,863
I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass
for a free turn.

140
00:08:58,113 --> 00:09:02,034
Yes, yes. But you can only use
it once, so choose wisely.

141
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:04,536
This is tricky.

142
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:10,209
I mean, I am in the lead, but I would
love another shot at the Golden Monkey.

143
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:15,714
-This game makes no sense!
-You're upset because you're losing.

144
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:19,843
Oh, come on, Ross.
I think we're all losers here.

145
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:23,430
I would like to hang
on to my Angel Pass please.

146
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:27,476
You can either spin the Wheel
or pick a Google Card.

147
00:09:27,643 --> 00:09:31,230
Let me think, let me think.
Oh, I don't care.

148
00:09:33,232 --> 00:09:34,900
You must choose.

149
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:39,446
-Either. It makes no difference.
-Choose, you jackass.

150
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,742
-I'll take a card.
-You picked the Gimme Card!

151
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:47,371
-You get all of Ross' points!
-What?

152
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:50,749
This game is kind of fun!

153
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,086
You don't think it's crazy that
you get my points..?

154
00:09:54,295 --> 00:09:58,215
The contestants aren't supposed
to speak to each other.

155
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:03,053
Now, do you wanna start
opening presents..

156
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,973
because it seems like people
are getting itchy to leave.

157
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,766
And when I say people,
I mean me.

158
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:14,732
-Why did you invite my mother?
-What?

159
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,235
She wants to move in with me and Ross
to help take care of the baby.

160
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,779
-For how long?
-Eight weeks.

161
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:25,534
I love my mother, but, my God,
a long lunch with her is taxing.

162
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:28,746
I'd be honored if she wanted
to live with me.

163
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:31,457
She can't hear you.

164
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,293
What am I gonna do?

165
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:38,339
If you don't want her to move
in with you, just tell her.

166
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,508
You're right.
I'm about to have a baby.

167
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:44,845
I can say I don't want
her sleeping on my couch.

168
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:48,307
She'll wanna sleep in my bed.
This can't happen.

169
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,767
That is right.

170
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:52,728
Tell her you don't want her
to live with you.

171
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:55,272
Do not take no for an answer.

172
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,861
This is great! Now she's
gonna be mad at Rachel!

173
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:06,158
And I'm just gonna swoop in there and
be like the daughter she never had.

174
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,077
Oh, honey, you have
to let it go.

175
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,746
Okay.

176
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:14,583
Who doesn't accept an apology?

177
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,335
I mean, it's just so simple.

178
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:18,754
"I'm sorry, Sandra."
"That's okay, Monica.

179
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:20,089
I forgive you.

180
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:22,091
And by the way, you're very pretty."

181
00:11:24,134 --> 00:11:28,555
I have new respect for Chandler.

182
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:33,060
All right, everybody!
It's time to open the presents!

183
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:36,230
Yes! The first gift
that Rachel opens..

184
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,857
should be from the grandmother.

185
00:11:39,024 --> 00:11:44,947
Because you're the most important
person in this room! And in the world!

186
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:48,534
I don't have a gift because I wasn't
invited until the last minute.

187
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,705
But thank you so much, dear, for
bringing that to everybody's attention.

188
00:11:55,749 --> 00:12:00,295
How about you less important people?
Let's open your presents!

189
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:05,134
-It's okay that you didn't get a gift.
-I kind of did.

190
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,719
Me! Eight weeks of me.

191
00:12:07,886 --> 00:12:11,723
Okay. See, Mom,
the truth is, I can do this on my own.

192
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,643
I know you're gonna be a terrific mom.

193
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,771
But you need help at the beginning.

194
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,607
I know what I'm doing.
I can handle it.

195
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,609
Really? Remember Twinkles?

196
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:26,780
He was a hamster.
I'm not gonna vacuum up my baby!

197
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:30,284
Okay, come on, Rach.
It's present time!

198
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:33,453
You're the glue holding
this party together.

199
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,915
It's kind of falling apart here.

200
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,293
-Oh, look!
-Wow!

201
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,336
This is from your friends at work.

202
00:12:41,503 --> 00:12:47,092
Oh, my gosh! Oh, wow!
Oh, I know what this is.

203
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:49,094
Wait a minute.

204
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:52,222
That can't be right.

205
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:56,018
Is that a beer bong for a baby?

206
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,313
Darling, that's a breast pump.

207
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:06,278
Did I say I was done guessing?
Okay, thank you for that.

208
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,031
Oh, wow! What's this?

209
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:12,659
-It's a Diaper Genie.
-It dispenses clean diapers!

210
00:13:12,868 --> 00:13:14,953
It's where you put dirty ones.

211
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:19,124
Why don't you take it outside
and throw it in a dumpster?

212
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:24,338
-You're gonna do that 10 times a day?
-What, it goes 10 times a day?

213
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:27,049
Are we feeding this baby Indian food?

214
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:30,385
No, dear. That's what babies do.

215
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:34,973
Rachel, listen to your mother.
She is very smart.

216
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:40,896
What will you do with the baby
while you trot out to the garbage?

217
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:45,067
I don't know,
I'd leave it on the changing table?

218
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:50,322
-What? What did I do? What did I do?
-You can't leave a baby alone.

219
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:52,199
Of course, I know that!

220
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:55,244
Of course you never leave
a baby alone.

221
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,871
It would..
She wouldn't be safe.

222
00:13:58,288 --> 00:14:02,209
Not as safe as she would be
with me, the baby dummy.

223
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:06,213
Opening the presents is a little
overwhelming right now.

224
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,841
I'm gonna maybe open
them all a little bit later.

225
00:14:10,008 --> 00:14:12,511
Thank you for coming,
for the gifts..

226
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:18,183
-and this basket is beautiful.
-It's actually a bassinet.

227
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:21,561
Okay, Mommy, don't ever leave me.

228
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:27,609
In what film would you hear this line:
"We don't need no stinking badges!"

229
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:30,737
-Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
-Correct! Backwards Bonus.

230
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:34,491
-Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
-Yes!

231
00:14:34,658 --> 00:14:36,493
What? There's extra points for that?

232
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,370
Fair not that's!

233
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,873
I'd like to go up the Ladder of Chance
to the Golden Mud Hut!

234
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,376
-Wise choice. How many rungs?
-Six!

235
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:50,007
-That noise can only mean one thing.
-Hungry Monkey!

236
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:54,386
-I'd like a Wicked Wango Card.
-It's an audio question.

237
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:58,348
Name this television theme song:

238
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:02,811
Oh, my God. I know this.
Give me a second.

239
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,063
-Tell it to the Time Turtle!
-Shut up!

240
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,357
-"I Dream of Jeannie"!
-Yes! Back in the lead!

241
00:15:07,524 --> 00:15:09,818
I'd like to spin the Wheel.

242
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:17,409
Oh, come on!

243
00:15:17,576 --> 00:15:19,244
Super Speedy Speed Round.

244
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:22,247
-Is there a Hopping Bonus?
-Of course.

245
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:27,919
-Who invented bifocals?
-Ben Franklin!

246
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,964
Correct. Which monarch ruled
Great Britain the longest?

247
00:15:31,173 --> 00:15:32,424
Queen Victoria!

248
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:36,845
You forgot to switch legs between
questions. No Hopping Bonus!

249
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:39,222
Every time!

250
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:43,393
-Yeah. Now over to Chandler.
-I'd like a Google Card.

251
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,273
-Are you sure?
-Yes! No! Google!

252
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:53,612
Oh, my God! Congratulations, Ross!
Because, Chandler..

253
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:55,947
-you've been Bamboozled!
-No!

254
00:15:56,156 --> 00:16:01,536
-Yes!
-This is the best game ever!

255
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:04,748
You'll stay as long as I need you?

256
00:16:04,915 --> 00:16:07,584
-Of course.
-I swear I'm not an idiot.

257
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:10,754
I read books on pregnancy
and giving birth.

258
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:15,258
I didn't think to read about what
to do when the baby comes.

259
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:17,135
And the baby's coming..

260
00:16:17,302 --> 00:16:22,391
and I don't know what to do.
Oh, can I throw up in my Diaper Genie?

261
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:25,644
Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.

262
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:29,064
-Where you going?
-I'm going to the bathroom.

263
00:16:29,272 --> 00:16:34,069
Now, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay.

264
00:16:34,903 --> 00:16:37,114
It is gonna be okay!

265
00:16:41,243 --> 00:16:43,412
Worth a shot.

266
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:48,166
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?

267
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:50,877
I just Bamboozled Chandler!

268
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:56,299
Which is not a sexual thing.

269
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:02,431
-Well, that was a quick shower.
-Not if you were here.

270
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,808
Looks like we got a lot of good stuff.

271
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:07,769
We did. My mom got
us the greatest gift of all.

272
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:09,938
A Play-Doh Barbershop?

273
00:17:11,106 --> 00:17:15,193
No. She's going to live
with us for eight weeks.

274
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:16,862
What?

275
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,866
Yes! She's gonna help us
take care of the baby!

276
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:23,869
You're not serious!

277
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:28,290
She's a very nice woman,
but we can't take eight weeks of her.

278
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:30,667
-She'll drive us crazy..
-Hi, Ross!

279
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:33,044
Hey, roomie!

280
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:42,179
Hey, I'm Ray.
I'm the producer of the show.

281
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:45,515
It's a pleasure to meet you, Ray.

282
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:49,936
This is Duncan and Erin.
They're gonna help with the audition.

283
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:54,149
-Right, Ray.
-Whenever you're ready.

284
00:17:54,357 --> 00:17:58,904
Hello. I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Let's play Bamboozled!

285
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:03,742
Erin, first question. In hockey,
who is known as "The Great One"?

286
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,160
-Gretzky.
-Correct!

287
00:18:05,368 --> 00:18:09,247
Want to pick a Wicked Wango Card
or spin the Wheel?

288
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:12,667
Didn't your agents give
you the revised rules?

289
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:15,921
We've eliminated all that.
No wheel. No cards.

290
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:18,048
Why?

291
00:18:18,256 --> 00:18:22,427
It was too complicated.
People didn't follow it.

292
00:18:22,594 --> 00:18:26,598
Complicated?! Spin the Wheel
to go up the Ladder of Chance..

293
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:30,101
through the Rainbow Ring
to the Golden Monkey.

294
00:18:30,268 --> 00:18:33,438
You yank his tail,
and you're in Paradise Pond!

295
00:18:34,064 --> 00:18:36,274
Yeah. All that's gone.

296
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:39,569
It's a simple
question-and-answer game now.

297
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:41,947
Well, what's fun about that?

298
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:46,618
You expect me to host a boring game
of people answering questions?

299
00:18:46,868 --> 00:18:49,621
Women in bikinis hold up the scores.

300
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,749
Let's play Bamboozled!

301
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:56,086
So I thought we'd put the
changing station in the living room.

302
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:59,673
I thought I'd bring in my decorator
because I feel like I'm at my best..

303
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,800
when surrounded by jewel tones.

304
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:05,345
Sure, who doesn't?

305
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,141
Oh, and all those dinosaur
knickknacks you have..

306
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,561
they might be more at home
in the garage.

307
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:18,233
-Well, we don't have a garage.
-Did I say garage? I meant garbage.

308
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:24,406
You know what? Maybe it's not
absolutely vital that you live with us.

309
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:30,120
-Well, Rachel needs help with the baby.
-I really do. I don't know anything.

310
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,163
I'm sure that's not true.

311
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,208
Oh, no?
Do I know anything about babies?

312
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,461
-No. Not a thing.
-It's frightening.

313
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:41,756
Even if she doesn't
know anything, I do.

314
00:19:41,923 --> 00:19:44,050
And I'll be there to show her.

315
00:19:44,926 --> 00:19:47,387
That's exactly what
Rachel's father told me.

316
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,806
Know what he said
at the first 3 a.m. feeding?

317
00:19:49,973 --> 00:19:52,183
"I'm tired. You take care of it."

318
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:55,020
Which I later said to him
when he wanted to have sex.

319
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,360
Well, I'm not Rachel's dad.

320
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,988
And no offense,
but he's an ass.

321
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:08,408
I do like you, Ross.

322
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:13,455
I have a son. His mother
and I didn't live together.

323
00:20:13,622 --> 00:20:18,168
When he was with me, I took
care of him all the time, by myself.

324
00:20:18,335 --> 00:20:21,504
-That's true. You do have another child.
-Yeah.

325
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:23,465
With another woman.

326
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:27,010
Have you no control, Ross?

327
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:31,514
That's a different issue.

328
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:36,895
The point is, when the baby comes,
I will be there to feed her..

329
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:39,397
and bathe her and change her.

330
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:42,901
I want to do all those things.

331
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:47,697
-You don't need me to live with you.
-Yes!

332
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:51,868
Yes. You're gonna be so missed.

333
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:56,373
-You'll be a great father.
-You'll be a wonderful grandma.

334
00:20:56,748 --> 00:21:00,710
Hello? I still don't know
what the hell I'm doing!

335
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,255
Every first-time mother
feels that way.

336
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:10,428
You're gonna pick it up. Hey, you will.
Look, when you first came to the city..

337
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:15,934
you were a spoiled, helpless little
girl who used Daddy's credit cards!

338
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:19,104
I hope you're going
somewhere with this.

339
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:22,107
Look at you.
You're this big executive.

340
00:21:22,357 --> 00:21:25,068
You are more capable
than you give yourself credit for.

341
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:29,406
I have no doubt you're gonna
be an incredible mother.

342
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:32,784
-Really?
-I'm telling you.

343
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:35,578
Thank you.

344
00:21:37,956 --> 00:21:40,375
All right. I'm gonna get going.

345
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:42,919
No, sweetheart, stay put.

346
00:21:43,128 --> 00:21:48,216
I'll let myself out. It's like I'm
not here. Which I almost wasn't.

347
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:54,472
You're just so funny. You're so funny.
What do I do?

348
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:58,727
Nothing. You have apologized
to her, like, a million times.

349
00:21:58,893 --> 00:22:01,980
And she's been nothing
but terrible to you.

350
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:07,485
You just threw her daughter a lovely,
albeit slightly boring, shower.

351
00:22:07,652 --> 00:22:12,741
-And she hasn't even thanked you for it.
-You know what? You're right.

352
00:22:12,991 --> 00:22:16,119
If you wanna say anything,
I'd tell her off.

353
00:22:16,286 --> 00:22:17,746
Really?

354
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,499
Okay, I will.

355
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,002
Mrs. Green?

356
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:25,754
Mrs. Green?

357
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,840
It is rude to leave a party without saying
goodbye to the host.

358
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:33,845
When someone apologizes to you,
the decent thing to do is to accept it.

359
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:36,306
What I did wasn't on purpose.

360
00:22:36,473 --> 00:22:40,143
But what you're doing to me now
is plain spiteful.

361
00:22:40,351 --> 00:22:41,686
-Spiteful?
-That's right.

362
00:22:41,895 --> 00:22:45,815
It's time you took a good
look in the mirror, young lady!

363
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:47,692
Old lady!

364
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:49,694
Lady!

365
00:22:49,903 --> 00:22:52,781
Wrap it up. Wrap it up. Wrap it up.

366
00:22:53,656 --> 00:22:57,660
So whenever you're ready to apologize
to me, I will forgive you.

367
00:22:57,827 --> 00:23:00,163
Good day.

368
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:05,043
I can't feel my legs!

369
00:23:05,835 --> 00:23:08,755
You were fantastic!
I'm so proud of you.

370
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,967
-Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
-You should be.

371
00:23:13,218 --> 00:23:17,639
-Could you get me something to drink?
-You got it!

372
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:22,685
Mrs. Green? Okay, I'm really sorry!
I apologize. If you..

373
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:27,357
Okay! I bit my tongue!

374
00:23:27,524 --> 00:23:30,860
But I'm still really sorry!

375
00:23:36,825 --> 00:23:38,910
-Okay, I'm ready.
-You sure?

376
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,038
I've done my studying,
and I know my stuff.

377
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:44,415
All right, then.

378
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:48,711
Rachel Green,
let's play Bamboozled!

379
00:23:49,337 --> 00:23:52,090
How do you test the temperature
of the baby's bath water?

380
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:54,384
-Put your elbow in it.
-Excellent!

381
00:23:54,592 --> 00:23:58,763
-How do you put a baby down for a nap?
-Full, dry, on its back, no loose covers.

382
00:23:58,972 --> 00:24:00,181
Correct!

383
00:24:00,348 --> 00:24:03,393
There's a hopping bonus here,
but I don't suggest you take it.

384
00:24:03,768 --> 00:24:04,978
Okay.

385
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,151
This is an audio question. What do
you do when a baby makes this sound:

386
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:17,115
Check if it's wet or hungry, burp it.

387
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:22,287
Excellent! Now do you want another
question or a Wicked Wango Card?

388
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:25,915
-A card! A card! I pick a card!
-Oh, I'm sorry.

389
00:24:26,082 --> 00:24:31,296
You've been Bamboozled!
You're gonna be a terrible mother!

390
00:24:33,256 --> 00:24:35,967
I've lost sight of why we're doing this!

391
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:40,638
Please don't walk away.

392
00:24:42,015 --> 00:24:44,017
I've gone too far.
