1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,394
Ross, she wants you.

2
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:07,164
We just live in the same building.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,006
-Any contact?
-She lent me an egg.

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,976
-You're in!
-Right.

5
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,079
Hey, Ross.

6
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,886
Come on. Get back in the game.

7
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:29,791
The Rachel thing isn't happening,
your ex-wife's a lesbian....

8
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,258
I don't think we need a third.

9
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:35,525
Could we get an egg,
still in the shell?

10
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:36,824
An egg?

11
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:41,906
Go up to her and say,
"I'm returning your egg."

12
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,842
I think it's winning.

13
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,174
-It's insane.
-She'll love it.

14
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:52,642
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Here.

15
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,546
Go with the egg, my friend.

16
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,191
Go, go, go!

17
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:06,461
-Think it'll work?
-No way. It's suicide.

18
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,258
The One With The Candy Hearts

19
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,811
-You can't do this.
-Do what?

20
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:03,888
-Roger wants to take her out.
-No! Remember why you dumped him?

21
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,857
Because he was creepy.

22
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,994
And mean. And frightening.

23
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:13,599
Still, it's nice to have
a date on Valentine's Day!

24
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,860
You can go out with a creep any night.

25
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,334
I know I do.

26
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:27,475
-What are you doing tomorrow night?
-That depends on how tonight goes.

27
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,808
-About tonight
-Don't you bail on me!

28
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:34,612
I said I'd bring a friend
for her friend.

29
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:39,019
-But her friend sounds like a
-Pathetic mess. I know, but....

30
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,321
Come on. She's needy, vulnerable.

31
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,259
I'm thinking....

32
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,765
Thanks.

33
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:55,397
You haven't been out with a woman
since Janice. You're doing this.

34
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:02,405
-She said yes.
-Way to go, man!

35
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,180
Still got the egg, huh?

36
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,423
How do I look?

37
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,324
I don't care.

38
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,332
There's Lorraine.

39
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,909
No trading. You get the pretty one,
I get the mess.

40
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,278
Hi, Joey.

41
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,080
Well, well!
Look what you brought!

42
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,750
Very nice.

43
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:46,255
And what did you bring?

44
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,424
She's checking her coat.

45
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,995
I'm gonna wash the cab smell
off of my hands.

46
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:56,532
Get me a white zinfandel,
and a glass of red for Janice.

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,104
Janice?

48
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,141
Janice!?

49
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,739
Oh...

50
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,346
... my...

51
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,278
...God!

52
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,621
Hey, it's Janice!

53
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,654
Okay, I'm making a break for it!

54
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:30,496
I've been waiting for, like, forever
to go out with Lorraine.

55
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,933
-Just calm down.
-Calm down?

56
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:37,576
You set me up with a woman I've
dumped twice in the last five months!

57
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:42,675
Can you stop yelling?
You're making me nervous and....

58
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,879
I can't go when I'm nervous.

59
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,681
I'm sorry, you're right.

60
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,119
Come on! Do it, do it!

61
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,865
Roger was creepy, but he was nothing
compared to Pete.

62
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,060
-Who?
-Pete the Weeper.

63
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:09,105
The guy that used to cry
every time we had sex?

64
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,938
"Was it good for you?"

65
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:18,279
I'd take crying any day
over Howard, the "I win" guy!

66
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,419
"I win! I win!"

67
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:25,789
We went out for two months.
I didn't win once.

68
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,450
How do we end up with these jerks?

69
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,495
We're some kind of magnets.

70
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,635
I know I am. That's why I can't
wear a digital watch.

71
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,866
There's more beer, right?

72
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,972
You know my friend who shaves her head?

73
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,502
No.

74
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,878
I have this friend
who shaves her head.

75
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,020
She says to break the
bad boyfriend cycle...

76
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,349
...you can do a cleansing ritual.

77
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:04,654
Pheebs, this woman
is voluntarily bald.

78
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,788
Yeah.

79
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,793
We can do it tomorrow night.

80
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,264
It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect.

81
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,702
Okay, what kind of ritual?

82
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:19,368
We can burn the stuff they gave us.

83
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,313
Or...?

84
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:27,577
Or we can chant and dance
around naked with sticks.

85
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,624
Burning's good.

86
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,759
You know...

87
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:47,429
... I can pick up quarters with my toes.

88
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,371
Yeah?
Good for you.

89
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:56,340
Quarters or rolls of quarters?

90
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:05,813
By the way, I cut you out of
all of my pictures.

91
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:10,894
So if you want, I have a bag
with just your heads.

92
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,826
That's okay.

93
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:16,895
You could make little puppets
out of them.

94
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:21,665
And you could use them in your
Theater of Cruelty!

95
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:28,143
-We can't do that!
-What? What can't you do?

96
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,978
Can I talk to you for a second?
Over there?

97
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,755
We might be leaving now.

98
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,955
Tell me it's you and me "we."

99
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:51,193
She wants to slather my body
with stuff and lick it off.

100
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,430
I'm not even sure what slathering is!

101
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,076
But I definitely want
to be a part of it!

102
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:02,375
Okay, you cannot do this to me.

103
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,080
You're right. I'm sorry.

104
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:09,984
Can we have three
chocolate mousses to go?

105
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,950
I'm out of here.

106
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:17,254
Here's my credit card.
Dinner's on me.

107
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,261
I hope she throws up on you.

108
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,035
Thanks.

109
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,302
-So....
-Just us.

110
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,972
What a crappy night!

111
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,835
I have enjoyed the fact...

112
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:38,483
...that your shirt's been
sticking out of your zipper.

113
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,247
Excuse me.

114
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,422
How you doing?

115
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:58,495
So do we have the best friends,
or what?

116
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:02,835
Joey's not a friend.
He's...

117
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:07,502
...a stupid man who left us
his credit card.

118
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,514
Another drink? Dessert?
A big-screen TV?

119
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,778
-I'll have a drink.
-Got it. Good woman!

120
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:24,024
-A bottle of overpriced champagne.
-Each.

121
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:28,030
That's right, each.
And a rob roy.

122
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,134
I've always wanted to know.

123
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,683
Happy Valentine's Day!

124
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,701
Oh, I miss you already.

125
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,929
-Can you believe this happened?
-No, no!

126
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,007
And yet it did.

127
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,270
-Goodbye, Janice.
-kiss me!

128
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,478
Oh, Chandler. Sorry.

129
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:22,018
Oh, Chandler. Sorry!

130
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,519
-Hey, Janice.
-Hi, Monica.

131
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,752
Well, this was very special.

132
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,022
Rach, come see who's out here!

133
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,191
What's going on? Oh, my God!

134
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,802
Janice! Hi!

135
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,873
Janice is gonna go away now!

136
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,635
I'll be right back.

137
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:50,009
Joey! Look who it is!

138
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,644
Good. Joey's home.

139
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,254
This is so much fun!

140
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:01,291
This is like a reunion in the hall!

141
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:06,724
Ross, there's someone
I want you to say hi to.

142
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,500
He happened to call.

143
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:14,504
Hi, Ross. That's right, it's me!
How did you know?

144
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:33,486
So, if dogs experience jet lag...

145
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:38,026
... because of the seven dog years
to one human year thing...

146
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,563
...when a dog flies
from New York to Los Angeles...

147
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:46,737
... he doesn't just lose three hours,
he loses a week and a half.

148
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:52,333
That's funny!

149
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,451
They should be cooking the food soon.

150
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,145
Oh, good.

151
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,531
Who are they?

152
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:21,196
The blond is my ex-wife.
The woman touching her is her...

153
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,701
...close, personal friend.

154
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:31,343
-They're lovers?
-lf you want to put a label on it.

155
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:37,452
-Anything else I should know?
-Nope. That's it.

156
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,856
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

157
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:48,424
I always forget that part.

158
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,125
Hello!

159
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:02,272
Now we need sage branches
and the sacramental wine.

160
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,479
All I had is oregano and a Fresca.

161
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,983
That's okay!

162
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:17,593
Now we need the semen
of a righteous man.

163
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:27,762
If we had that, we wouldn't be doing
the ritual in the first place.

164
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:32,535
-Can we start throwing things in?
-Yeah, okay!

165
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,977
Okay.
Barry's letters.

166
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,846
Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.

167
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,322
And I have the receipt
from my dinner with....

168
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,688
-A picture of Scotty Jared naked!
-Let me see!

169
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:56,265
-He's wearing a sweater.
-No.

170
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,109
-Whose MCl card is that?
-Mine. Shoot!

171
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,009
Remember this number:
Nine, seven, four....

172
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:14,215
Okay, and here we have
the last of Paolo's grappa.

173
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:17,048
Wait, isn't it almost pure

174
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,060
How can I dump this woman
on Valentine's Day?

175
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,893
I don't know.
You dumped her on New Year's.

176
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:33,770
In my next life,
I'm coming back as a toilet brush.

177
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,541
Hello, funny valentine!

178
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,235
Hi, just Janice.

179
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,382
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.

180
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,849
I could just kiss you all over,
and I'm gonna.

181
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,727
If you don't do it, I will.

182
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:21,010
-So are you actually from New York?
-Not originally. I'm from

183
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:25,282
-You said they'd shoot it without you.
-I thought they could.

184
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:31,430
The maxi-pads were a piece of cake.
Mini-pads should be that much easier.

185
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,556
-It's Valentine's Day.
-I know, but it's my job.

186
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,897
I'll try to get back
as soon as I can.

187
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,265
I'm spending most of my time
teaching science...

188
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:47,241
...which is funny because
that wasn't even my major.

189
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,450
Now, that is funny!

190
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:09,032
Do you think it would be too weird
if I invited Carol over to join us?

191
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:14,764
Because she's alone now.
And pregnant. And sad.

192
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,933
-I guess.
-Are you sure? Carol!

193
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,944
-Wanna join us?
-No, I'm fine.

194
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,446
Come on.
These people will scooch down.

195
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:31,956
You guys will scooch, won't you?
Let's try scooching! Come on!

196
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,285
-Come on.
-Thank you.

197
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:40,726
IKristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.
Carol, Kristen.

198
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:44,732
-How do you do?
-Carol teaches sixth grade.

199
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,605
And Kristen....

200
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,076
IKristen does something...

201
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,810
...that, funnily enough...

202
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,778
...wasn't even her major!

203
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:08,216
-Thanks for coming over.
-Not at all. It's pretty much our job.

204
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,191
That's why we get the cool hats.

205
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:15,834
-What do we got there?
-A piece of sik boxer shorts.

206
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,367
Some greeting cards.

207
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,831
A half-charred picture of....

208
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,204
That guy's hairier than the chief!

209
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:32,015
It's a really funny story
how this happened.

210
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:37,553
I was taking out the trash,
and Phoebe was burning incense

211
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,088
It's all right.

212
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:44,354
This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire
we've seen get out of control.

213
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,430
-Third one tonight.
-Really?

214
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,797
Valentine's is our
busiest night of the year.

215
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:57,139
Next time you're burning
your ex-boyfriend's stuff:

216
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,243
One, do it in a well-ventilated area.

217
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:05,611
Two, if you wanna burn his clothing,
stay away from synthetic fabrics.

218
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:11,484
Three, try to let go of the anger,
and learn to love yourself.

219
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,494
-I brought you something.
-ls it loaded?

220
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:26,895
Oh, little candy hearts.
"Chan and Jan Forever."

221
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,371
I had them made special.

222
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,243
Okay, Janice.

223
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,146
Hey, Janice.

224
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,220
There's no way to tell you this.

225
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,881
At least, there's no new way.

226
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:55,159
I just don't think things
are gonna work out.

227
00:18:56,535 --> 00:19:00,130
That's fine.

228
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,471
It is?

229
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:08,635
Because I know that this
isn't the end.

230
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,739
You see, actually, it is.

231
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,750
No, because you won't let that happen.

232
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,784
Don't you know it yet?

233
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:21,392
You love me, Chandler Bing!

234
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,189
Oh, no, I don't.

235
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:31,359
Why do we keep ending up together?
New Year's, who invited who?

236
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,597
-Valentine's, who asked who into bed?
-I did, but

237
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,401
You seek me out!

238
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:42,571
Something deep in your soul
calls out to me like a foghorn!

239
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:46,581
Janice! Janice!

240
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,913
You push me away,
you pull me back!

241
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,883
You want me. You need me.

242
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:58,995
You can't live without me.
And you know it.

243
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:04,836
You just don't know you know it.

244
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,034
See?

245
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:18,409
Call me!

246
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:29,618
It's not true.
I never called your mother a wolverine.

247
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:33,160
You did so, I swear to

248
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,363
How long has she been in the bathroom?

249
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,802
She isn't in the bathroom.
Her coat's gone.

250
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,638
Well, maybe it's cold in there.

251
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,676
I screwed up my first date
in nine years.

252
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,545
-That could be it.
-Oh, God.

253
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:58,622
You know, this is still pretty hot.

254
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:04,091
Mushroom.

255
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,455
Smile.

256
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:11,193
They won't all be like this.
Some might stay through dinner.

257
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,600
-I'm sorry. That's not funny.
-It's just....

258
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,367
You know the whole
"get on with your life" thing?

259
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,875
Well, do I have to?

260
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:25,914
I'm sitting here
with this cute woman...

261
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,245
...and she's perfectly nice, but that...

262
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,591
...that's it.

263
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:38,729
Then I'm here talking to you,
and it's easy and it's fun.

264
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,431
And I don't have to....

265
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,324
-I know.
-You know?

266
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,667
Here's a wacky thought.

267
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:54,573
Let's say you and I give it
another shot.

268
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:58,273
I know what you're gonna say.
You're a lesbian.

269
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:04,254
But what do you say we just
put that aside for now.

270
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:07,118
Let's just stick a pin in it.

271
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:13,231
Because we're great together.
You can't deny it.

272
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:17,534
I've got a ring at home
that fits you.

273
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:22,571
I've got lots of pictures
with both of us in them.

274
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:26,972
And best of all,
you're carrying my baby.

275
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,875
-I mean, how perfect is that?
-Ross

276
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:35,714
You keep saying that, but there's
something right here. I love you.

277
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,462
I love you too.

278
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,331
-But
-No "but."

279
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:54,596
You know that thing we
put over here with the pin in it?

280
00:22:55,741 --> 00:23:00,075
It's time to take the pin out.

281
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,752
You'll find someone.
The right woman is waiting for you.

282
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,480
It's easy for you to say.
You found one already.

283
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:18,455
All you need is a woman who likes men,
and you'll be set.

284
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,401
Not her.

285
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:39,443
So, you guys really slide down a pole?

286
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,947
-Absolutely.
-That's so cool.

287
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,150
How do you get back up?

288
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:55,692
Well, we rarely have to return
from a fire as quickly.

289
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,365
So, would you guys....

290
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:06,442
Would you like to, sometime, maybe....

291
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,613
Go for a drink sometime?

292
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,179
Sure, sounds good.

293
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:13,715
We get off at midnight.
We'll pick you up then.

294
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,580
Okay. Great!

295
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:20,286
So will you bring the truck?

296
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,220
I'll even let you ring the bell.

297
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,229
-We'll see you later.
-Bye! See you later!

298
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:30,731
Oh, my God!

299
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,634
See? There you go.
The cleansing worked.

300
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,900
You're right. They're nice guys!

301
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:41,944
They're firemen guys!

302
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:46,482
-Tell them you're married?
-No. My girlfriend doesn't even know.
