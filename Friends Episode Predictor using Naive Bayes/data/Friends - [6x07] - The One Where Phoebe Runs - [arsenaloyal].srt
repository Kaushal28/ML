1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:03,631
Ready?

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:07,372
Hi, it's Rachel and Phoebe's.
Please...

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,269
-Leave..
-Leave.

4
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,208
But I just said "leave."

5
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,312
I know because you have
all the good words.

6
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:20,243
What do I get? I get "it's," "and."
Oh, I'm sorry, I have "a." Forget it.

7
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:23,547
-That's silly.
-All right. So let's switch.

8
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,984
No, I have all the good words.

9
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,552
Okay, fine, fine.
We can switch.

10
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,662
- Hi...
-everybody...

11
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:33,888
-It's...
-Rachel...

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,089
-and...
-Phoebe's.

13
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,426
Wait. How did you do that?

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,103
What?

15
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,806
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate,
are you?

16
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,239
This is gonna be interesting.

17
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:49,975
Can we finish this later?
I'm going running before it gets dark.

18
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,681
-Why don't you come with me?
-Really?

19
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:57,652
It'll be fun! We'll run in the park.
It'll be our roommate-bonding thing.

20
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,324
Okay, let's go running!

21
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,992
-There's cute guys there.
-Let's run towards them!

22
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,593
Wait just one more second.

23
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,595
Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's.
Please leave a message. Thanks!

24
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,700
Wait a minute.
You took all the words!

25
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,533
You've met your match, Rachel Greene!

26
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,343
The One Where Phoebe Runs

27
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,578
I just finished this
fascinating book.

28
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,977
By the year 2030,
there'll be computers...

29
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:05,247
that can carry out the same amount
of functions as a human brain.

30
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,617
So, theoretically,
you could download...

31
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:11,263
your thoughts and memories
into this computer...

32
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:15,728
and live forever as a machine.

33
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,740
And I just realized I can sleep
with my eyes open.

34
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,614
Honey, it was a great idea,
nailing the boxes to the floor.

35
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:37,119
-I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
-So you can move them!

36
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,355
And while I'm doing that, Ross has
a great computer story for you.

37
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,599
Hey, everybody!
I'd like you to meet Janine.

38
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,802
She's gonna be my new roommate!

39
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,165
And she's gonna live with me!

40
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,875
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?

41
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,340
Le Croix.

42
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,344
I didn't know that.
What a pretty last name.

43
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,216
So where are you from?

44
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,455
Australia.
I just moved here.

45
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,123
From the land down under?

46
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,383
I didn't know that either!

47
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,286
So what do you do?

48
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,294
-I'm a dancer.
-You're a dancer?

49
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,532
She's a dancer!

50
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,136
I think I'll go unpack.

51
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,079
Did you interview her
before you asked her to move in?

52
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,876
Of course!

53
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,545
What did you ask her?

54
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,552
When can you move in?

55
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,995
Thank you for bringing her
into our lives.

56
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,264
Unbelievable.

57
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,726
Down, boy.

58
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,462
Oh, no, no, no. She's not my type.
Not for me, she's not my type. She's too..

59
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,801
Beautiful, tall, sexy,
showing her stomach?

60
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,704
Look at all the boxes!

61
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,876
I cannot wait to ask her out.

62
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,379
Wait a minute.
You can't. She's your roommate.

63
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,016
It'll be too complicated.

64
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,719
Yeah, don't do it.

65
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,321
I mean, if you date her,
then I can't date her.

66
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,624
What if you started going out with her
and it didn't work out?

67
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,558
That's when I make my move.

68
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,331
Remember when you broke up
with Donna...

69
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,800
how horrible it was when you
bumped into her at the supermarket?

70
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,470
Oh, God, yeah.

71
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,300
Now imagine you live
at the supermarket.

72
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,736
Okay!

73
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,246
You're right! I don't want that.
I can't date her.

74
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:48,511
You'd better watch the flirting too,
because it could be trouble.

75
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,584
Well, that's gonna be tough, Mon.

76
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:54,190
It's hard for me to be around
an attractive woman and not flirt.

77
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,287
You're around me all the time,
and you don't flirt.

78
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,599
A little sad about that, sweetie?

79
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,371
I have to tie my shoes, so you
go ahead. I'll catch up.

80
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,381
Come on, that's not running!
Let's go!

81
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,318
I'm telling you, when she runs...

82
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,652
she looks like Kermit the Frog...

83
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,886
and the Six Million Dollar Man.

84
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,656
Monica had such a crush on him.

85
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:40,362
She used to kiss his poster
every night before she went to bed.

86
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,765
I used to do that too!

87
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,374
Did you also have his album,
"It's Not Easy Being Green"?

88
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,111
Oh, Mon.

89
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,080
So Phoebe runs weird, huh?

90
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,382
Yeah. And I know she'll
want to run again.

91
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:59,557
I don't know how to get out of it.
I mean, I live with her.

92
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,851
Why don't you be straight with her?
Tell her the truth.

93
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,588
You're right.
I should just tell her the truth.

94
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,032
Phoebe, Monica tripped me. I don't
think I can ever run again, ever!

95
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,370
But we were having so much fun.
All those cute guys were checking us out.

96
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,535
I know. They were definitely staring.

97
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,142
Why? Why would you do that?

98
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,379
I don't know.

99
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,414
Rachel, I'm sorry I hurt your ankles.

100
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,154
-Ankle.
-We'll see.

101
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,059
Okay. I am officially unpacked.

102
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,993
Thanks for helping me, man.

103
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,890
Joe?

104
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,773
Well, I guess Joey went home.

105
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,408
And look, there is still one box
I have to unpack.

106
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,216
I got you!

107
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,119
Oh, my God, you almost gave me
a heart attack.

108
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,427
It was so hard not to laugh.

109
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,355
Hey, the place looks great.

110
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:13,690
Not bad, right?

111
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,800
Monica's working late,
so I'm gonna make this place spotless.

112
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,700
You know what else I'll do?

113
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,805
I'm gonna go downstairs
and get her some flowers.

114
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,906
Who wouldn't want to live with me?

115
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,470
I don't.

116
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:30,909
No, I want to live with
the super-hot Australian dancer!

117
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,084
How's that going? Are you okay
with the not-flirting thing?

118
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,151
So far. But it's tough.

119
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,552
I've got this built-up flirting energy,
and I don't know how to get rid of it.

120
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,955
How you doing?

121
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,866
Get out!

122
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,900
Oh, man!

123
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,674
Sorry. There's just
more room out here.

124
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:05,043
No, you just reminded me
that I have to do my stretches too.

125
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,915
Why don't you try to be...?

126
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,592
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

127
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,591
I didn't want you to touch me...

128
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,924
because I'm all sweaty
from the workout.

129
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,799
I'm gonna hit the shower.

130
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,564
Oh, my God!

131
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,741
Sorry about that stuff
hanging in there.

132
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,809
It's just my thongs are
too delicate for the dryer.

133
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,482
Oh, yeah, it's me.

134
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,787
I saw you grab your running shoes
this morning and sneak out.

135
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,291
You lied so you could run by yourself.

136
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,557
No, Phoebe, no. I was....

137
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,428
I was actually just checking...

138
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,796
to see...

139
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,768
if I could run. And I can!

140
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,440
Please, I'm not an idiot.

141
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,004
No, wait. Phoebe?

142
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,658
Wow. Couples who live together
do start to look alike.

143
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:25,093
I am working right now. So say what you
have to say and leave me alone!

144
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,758
Sound alike too.

145
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,866
So, Mondler....

146
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,402
What are you doing?

147
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,803
What does it look like?
I am cleaning.

148
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,377
Did you get Monica's authorization
to move all her stuff?

149
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,183
I don't need that.
I'll put everything back.

150
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,682
Put it back exactly
where you found it?

151
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,152
Yes. I'm gonna put it back
exactly where I found it.

152
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,915
First of all,
that attitude is not helping.

153
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,491
She won't care if I put her stuff
back in the same stupid place.

154
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:01,224
Hello? Did you just meet Monica?

155
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,237
She'll recognize
that I did a nice thing...

156
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,165
and appreciate it.

157
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,864
Actually, this will work out well.

158
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,010
Because when you move back
with Joey...

159
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:15,236
Joey's hot new roommate
can come live with me.

160
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,373
Oh, I see. You're trying
to freak me out.

161
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:23,214
Chandler, Monica is really weird
about this kind of stuff, all right?

162
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:28,120
Believe me, I lived with her for
16 years. She's going to freak out.

163
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,852
Oh, my God.
She's going to sit on you.

164
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,225
That probably won't hurt as much anymore.

165
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,028
No, she is not.
I'll prove it to you.

166
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,998
I'll call her right now.

167
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,704
Phone's done.

168
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,909
-Hey, Mon. How's it going?
-Terrible.

169
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,477
If I want something done right,
I have to do it myself.

170
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,377
Other people just wreck stuff.

171
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,483
I think I might kill someone tonight.

172
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,055
Come on, it can't be that bad.

173
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,021
The only thing getting me through...

174
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,162
is knowing I'll see you soon.

175
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,594
I might even try
to get out of here early.

176
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,663
It sounds like they need you there.

177
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,496
-You're just hanging out with Ross?
-It's all good! Okay, bye!

178
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,739
She's gonna kill me.

179
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,708
The phone was facing the other way.

180
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,911
And that goes back up there.

181
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,443
This is good. This is under control.
We should start with the big stuff.

182
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:32,057
That'll be the easiest.
Let's start with the couch.

183
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:34,683
I got it.

184
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,529
That doesn't look right.

185
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,894
What are you talking about?
The couch is in line with the carpet.

186
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:48,402
Then I can just walk over here
and casually put my feet up on....

187
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,369
Okay, here's what we do.

188
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,010
We move the couch
closer to the coffee table.

189
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,238
But then the back of the couch
won't line up with the carpet.

190
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,576
Well, we'll just move
the coffee table...

191
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:01,742
closer to the couch.

192
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:07,185
But then the coffee table
won't be centered in the seating area.

193
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,927
But the coffee table doesn't
match the table!

194
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,463
Look, what am I gonna do?

195
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:21,163
I'm not flirting, but I'm drawing
her to me like a moth to a flame!

196
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,913
What the hell's going on over here?

197
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,948
Monica's gonna kill you!

198
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:34,779
I need your help.

199
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,615
I have to do something
to repel this woman.

200
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,689
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

201
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,757
You guys repel women all the time!

202
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,957
Hey, I've been married three times.

203
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,130
No, I've seen it happen.

204
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:58,173
You get a rapport going with a woman,
but somehow you manage to kill it.

205
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:02,143
Time after time after time after time.

206
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,576
What's your secret?

207
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,346
We do not repel women, okay?

208
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,281
That is completely untrue.

209
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,116
Oh, yes, we do, my man.

210
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,090
Remember when we went to a dance...

211
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,421
and you walked up to that girl
you liked and talked...

212
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,132
about the lrish potato famine?

213
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,003
What about you?
You weren't so hot either.

214
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,535
After everything he said,
he'd go..

215
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,507
Monica doesn't like that either.
I should stop doing that.

216
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:37,372
Girls don't like it when
I start talking about science.

217
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,811
That's not specific to girls.

218
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,687
This is great. What else?

219
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,719
They don't like you correcting
their grammar.

220
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,449
And they don't like it when you
explain why your jokes are funny.

221
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:54,697
They don't like it when you
keep asking them if they like you.

222
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:59,470
-Man, I am so lucky I have Monica.
-I'm never gonna find love again.

223
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,371
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure.

224
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,316
Phoebe, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, okay?

225
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,716
I handled the situation horribly.

226
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,323
And I should not have lied to you.

227
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,229
So what should you have done?

228
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,724
I should have told you the truth.

229
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,200
Which is?

230
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:34,603
Well, the reason I didn't
want to go running with you is...

231
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,401
because...

232
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,942
the way that you run
is just a little....

233
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,947
-So?
-It's embarrassing.

234
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,411
People were looking at us
like we were crazy.

235
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,452
-Why do you care?
-Because they're people!

236
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,717
People you don't know
and will never see again.

237
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,085
Yes, but still they are people...

238
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,623
with eyes.

239
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,531
I didn't get embarrassed
running next to Miss....

240
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:05,767
But okay.

241
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:10,203
I can see why running with me
would be embarrassing to you.

242
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,070
Okay. You're uptight.

243
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,042
What? I am not uptight.

244
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,943
I am not uptight, man.

245
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:26,121
That's okay. I'm not judging you.
That's just who you are.

246
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,825
I'm more free, you know.
I run like I did when I was a kid...

247
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,792
because that's the only way
it's fun, you know?

248
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:36,466
Didn't you ever run so fast
you thought your legs would fall off...

249
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:41,572
Like when you were running towards
the swings or running away from Satan?

250
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,335
The neighbor's dog.

251
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,807
Is this in the right place?

252
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,248
Who cares? I repel women.

253
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,088
You can't come in here!

254
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,987
Ross is naked!

255
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,866
I couldn't say I was naked,
because she's allowed to see me naked.

256
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,435
Why does anyone have to be naked?

257
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,799
Why is Ross naked?

258
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:24,045
I had to show Chandler something.

259
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,577
Naked?

260
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,790
I guess I have...

261
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,189
a "guy" problem.

262
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,692
Is it the same thing
Chandler had?

263
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,195
We'll get everything squared away,
and you can come back later!

264
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:51,502
There's still some of Chandler's
medicine in the bathroom.

265
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,477
-Bye.
-Bye!

266
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,712
Thank God.

267
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,152
Dude, what'd you have?

268
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,657
We have no time, okay?
We must focus.

269
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,695
We've got to get everything
back into its original place.

270
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,856
The photo album!

271
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,935
There were millions of pictures
of the apartment in the photo album.

272
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,730
We just match everything
to the pictures!

273
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,272
That's perfect! That's brilliant!

274
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,373
What'd you have?

275
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,777
I've got some beer for you.

276
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:39,215
Don't you mean "for whom"?

277
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,285
Sure.

278
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,195
I was gonna order some pizza.
You wanna share one?

279
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:49,731
Pizza? It's not like I never
had that before.

280
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,266
Is something wrong?

281
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:58,966
Yeah. I'm depressed about that
Irish potato famine.

282
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:04,212
No, I mean with me. Because you seem
to be acting really weird around me.

283
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,446
All right, all right.

284
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,586
Let's just get this
out in the open, okay?

285
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,619
You're hot.

286
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,416
I'm lovable.

287
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:19,190
Clearly, there's a vibe
going on between us.

288
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,557
But we're roommates...

289
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,462
and it's a huge mistake
for us to continue down this road.

290
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,262
Imagine living in a supermarket...

291
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:29,907
and you'll understand.

292
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,808
Okay? So the question is,
what do we do?

293
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,640
There isn't anything to do.

294
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,407
I think you're really sweet.

295
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,213
But I'm not interested
in you like that.

296
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,251
No, I mean....

297
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:57,166
You're a nice guy, and I'm happy
to be your roommate and your friend.

298
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,404
I'm just, you know, I just...

299
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,834
don't feel that way about you.

300
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,601
I see what happened.

301
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,910
It's because I was trying
to repel you.

302
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:16,019
Right? Believe me, you'd feel
a lot different if I turned it on.

303
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,454
-I don't think so.
-Oh, I do.

304
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,462
How you doing?

305
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,932
I'm okay.

306
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,962
What?

307
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,125
What?

308
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,969
Oh, dear God!

309
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,222
I'm so sorry. You're right.
This feels great!

310
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:03,366
And you don't care if people stare.
It's only a second. Then you're gone!

311
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,961
It's amazing!
I feel so free and so graceful!

312
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,836
Watch out for the horse.

313
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,044
Can I come in now?

314
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,329
-Why is everything different?
-Bye.

315
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,835
I don't see anything different...

316
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,735
other than the fact that the room
got brighter when you came into it.

317
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:47,210
The end table is wrong,
the couch looks bizarre...

318
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,711
and don't even get me started
on the refrigerator magnets.

319
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,209
Okay, don't be mad, okay?

320
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:58,613
After I unpacked the boxes, I wanted
to do something nice for you...

321
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,791
so I cleaned the apartment.

322
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:05,554
So I moved everything around,
and then I forgot...

323
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:09,095
where it went back.
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry.

324
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,430
That's okay.

325
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,232
Are you afraid of me or something?

326
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,042
Do you want me to be afraid of you?

327
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,973
Of course not.

328
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,743
My gosh, Chandler, what you did
is a wonderful thing...

329
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,780
and I really appreciate it.

330
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,444
I have this thing where I want
everything in the perfect place.

331
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:33,156
But I'd never expect you
to worry about that.

332
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,122
Really?

333
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,054
Of course.

334
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,586
Oh, you're the best.

335
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,489
You come here to me.

336
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,829
Hold on, okay?
First things first.

337
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,505
Did Ross sit anywhere
while he was naked?

338
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,243
It said that by the year 2030...

339
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,644
there'll be computers carrying
out the same number of functions...

340
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,910
as an actual human brain.

341
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,553
So, theoretically, you could
download your thoughts...

342
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,985
and your memories
