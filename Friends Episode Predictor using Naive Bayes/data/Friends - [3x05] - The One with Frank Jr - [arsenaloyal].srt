1
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:11,655
So, what happened?
Did a forest tick you off?

2
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:16,852
No. You know how we're always
saying we need a place for the mail.

3
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:21,361
Yeah?

4
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:27,065
l started building one. But then
l decided to take it to the next step.

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,572
You're building a post office?

6
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:34,707
No, an entertainment unit
with a built-in mail cubby.

7
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,746
-lt's a one-day job, max.
-Okay.

8
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:42,048
My word, those are snug!

9
00:00:43,388 --> 00:00:46,050
Yeah. These are
my old work pants.

10
00:00:46,358 --> 00:00:48,451
Sergio Valente.

11
00:00:58,003 --> 00:01:00,665
Power saw kind of got away
from me there.

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,435
The One With Frank Jr.

13
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,218
Hey, Pheebs.
Any sign of your brother?

14
00:01:54,393 --> 00:01:56,418
No, but he's always late.

15
00:01:56,628 --> 00:01:58,960
-l thought you only met him once.
-l did.

16
00:02:00,632 --> 00:02:04,068
l think it sounds big sister-y,
''Frank's always late.''

17
00:02:05,103 --> 00:02:07,298
Well, relax. He'll be here.

18
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:09,406
l know.
l'm just nervous.

19
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:12,771
lt's just, Mom's dead,
don't talk to my sister...

20
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:15,639
...Grandma's been sleeping
a lot lately.

21
00:02:16,248 --> 00:02:20,309
lt's just the last-desperate-
chance-to-have-a-family kind of thing.

22
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:22,112
You're sweet to wait with me.

23
00:02:22,287 --> 00:02:26,280
Actually, Gunther sent me. You're not
allowed to have cups out here.

24
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:31,829
Does anyone else think
David Copperfield's cute?

25
00:02:33,932 --> 00:02:37,163
No. But he told me he thinks
you're a fox.

26
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,665
All right. Janice likes him.

27
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:44,798
ln fact, she likes him so much,
she put him on her freebie list.

28
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:47,303
Her what?

29
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:52,678
We have a deal where we each get to pick
five celebrities we could sleep with...

30
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:55,579
...and the other one can't get mad.

31
00:02:55,787 --> 00:02:58,950
The heart of every
healthy relationship:

32
00:02:59,124 --> 00:03:02,582
Honesty, respect
and sex with celebrities.

33
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:04,787
So who's on your list?

34
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:06,487
Kim Basinger...

35
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:08,963
...Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry...

36
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:11,030
...Yasmine Bleeth...

37
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:14,232
...and Jessica Rabbit.

38
00:03:15,874 --> 00:03:20,174
You do realize that she is a cartoon
and way out of your league?

39
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:24,405
l know. l always wondered if l could
get her eyes to pop out of her head.

40
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:27,416
This is such a great thing.

41
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:31,955
Annie Esposito would never have
dumped me had we had a list like this.

42
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:36,220
And also, of course,
if her sister was famous.

43
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:38,861
Who would yours be?

44
00:03:39,197 --> 00:03:42,064
First, l need a boyfriend.
Then l can have a list.

45
00:03:42,868 --> 00:03:44,802
lt's just a game, Mon.

46
00:03:46,872 --> 00:03:48,305
Rach, how about you?

47
00:03:48,473 --> 00:03:52,603
l don't know. l guess Chris
O'Donnell, John F. Kennedy Jr...

48
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,541
...Daniel Day-Lewis, Sting
and Parker Stevenson.

49
00:03:58,316 --> 00:04:00,045
Spider-Man?

50
00:04:00,218 --> 00:04:02,015
Hardy Boy.

51
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:05,423
-Peter Parker.
-Thank you.

52
00:04:05,957 --> 00:04:08,482
What about you, honey?
Who'd be on your list?

53
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,196
That kind of thing
requires some serious thought.

54
00:04:12,364 --> 00:04:16,391
First, l'd divide my prospective
candidates into categories.

55
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:17,592
What a geek!

56
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:22,439
Everybody, this is Frank!
My half brother, Frank!

57
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:24,073
This is everybody.

58
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:26,073
-This is Ross.
-How are you?

59
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:27,939
-Chandler.
-Hi.

60
00:04:28,113 --> 00:04:30,581
-Joey.
-Hey.

61
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:32,211
This is Monica.

62
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:36,647
And this is Rachel.

63
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:41,915
l'm gonna get coffee for us.

64
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:44,890
Hey, how do you guys get
anything done?

65
00:04:45,363 --> 00:04:47,263
We don't, really.

66
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,498
So now,
do you guys have big plans?

67
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:54,571
Yeah. We're gonna connect
and bond and everything.

68
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:59,403
l thought we could go down to Times
Square and pick up some ninja stars.

69
00:04:59,578 --> 00:05:03,708
My friend Larry, he wants me
to take a picture of a hooker.

70
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,319
We really don't take advantage
of living in the city.

71
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:24,996
Sorry. Did l get you?

72
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:27,470
No, you didn't get me!

73
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:31,073
lt's an electric drill!
You get me, you kill me!

74
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:34,441
Calm down!
Do you want this unit or not?

75
00:05:34,746 --> 00:05:37,078
l do not want this unit!

76
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:40,376
You should've told me before.
l'm not a mind reader.

77
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:45,179
And we're out of beer.
l'm going to Monica's.

78
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,984
Fine!

79
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,129
Where you heading in those pants?
1 982?

80
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,862
Monica, listen...

81
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:03,974
...l saw down at the hardware store,
they got those designer tiles on sale...

82
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:06,303
...if you wanna redo
your bathroom floor.

83
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:08,446
What's wrong with my bathroom floor?

84
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:11,480
Nothing. lt's just old and dingy,
that's all.

85
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:15,683
-l highly doubt that.
-Oh, yeah?

86
00:06:15,854 --> 00:06:18,584
lf you move your hamper...

87
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:22,488
...you can see the color
the tile used to be.

88
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:27,130
l can't live like this!
What are we gonna do?

89
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:28,698
Relax. Here, hold this.

90
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:31,631
This old stuff comes right up.
l'll show you.

91
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:36,864
A little more than l wanted to see.

92
00:06:39,577 --> 00:06:42,603
Look at that!
Every inch of this is glued down.

93
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:45,409
lt'd take forever to pry this up.

94
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,710
You should just leave it.

95
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:52,849
l can't leave it! You gouged
a hole in my dingy floor!

96
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,799
There. There you go.

97
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:05,600
Yeah, that's nice.

98
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,536
We can put it back there after the
surgeons remove it from your colon.

99
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:12,035
Give me a new floor!

100
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,976
l can't. Chandler will kill me
if l don't finish the unit.

101
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:20,015
-l'll pay you double what he's paying you.
-He's not paying me anything.

102
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:21,709
Triple.

103
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:34,320
What?

104
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:37,468
l know what l wanted to ask you.
Can you roll your tongue?

105
00:07:39,337 --> 00:07:41,396
Because l can and my mom couldn't.

106
00:07:41,573 --> 00:07:45,100
And l figured that was
something l got from our dad.

107
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:47,642
Well, wait, you mean like this?

108
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:51,008
Yeah, you can do it too. Yeah.

109
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:53,545
You're not doing it.

110
00:07:53,885 --> 00:07:57,343
Oh, right. Okay.
Yeah, my mom could and l can't.

111
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,715
We don't have that.

112
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:09,130
-When's your birthday?
-February 1 6.

113
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:11,764
l know a guy who's the 1 8th.

114
00:08:13,738 --> 00:08:15,569
That's close.

115
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:20,208
-When's yours?
-October 25.

116
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,907
That's the same month as Halloween.

117
00:08:31,222 --> 00:08:34,316
So, what kind of things
do you like to do at home?

118
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,625
Melt stuff.

119
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:44,695
-Okay, l've got three of my five.
-Three of your five what?

120
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,966
Celebrities l'm allowed to sleep with.

121
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:50,536
God, you're giving this
a lot of thought.

122
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,404
Hey, it's hard, okay?
l only have two spots left.

123
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:56,741
All right. Who you got it
narrowed down to?

124
00:08:56,948 --> 00:09:00,213
-Elizabeth Hurley.
-Very attractive.

125
00:09:00,385 --> 00:09:01,977
Forgiving.

126
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:05,883
Susan Sarandon.

127
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,754
You know what?
She's too political.

128
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:14,592
She probably wouldn't let you do it unless
you donated four cans of food first.

129
00:09:15,934 --> 00:09:20,098
-And lsabella Rossellini.
-Very hot. Very sexy.

130
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:23,570
But she's too international.

131
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:25,504
She's never gonna be around.

132
00:09:25,677 --> 00:09:28,043
-So?
-So you gotta play the odds.

133
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:31,376
Pick somebody who's gonna be
in the country all the time.

134
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,546
Yeah. Because that's why you won't
get lsabella Rossellini. Geography.

135
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:49,898
Okay. So by ''melting''
you meant melting.

136
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:55,234
-So is it, like, art?
-Yeah, you can melt art.

137
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,741
Hey, can l use your phone?

138
00:10:00,178 --> 00:10:04,274
-Sure. You want to call your mom?
-No, l want to melt it.

139
00:10:06,284 --> 00:10:09,151
Just the numbers.
lt will still work.

140
00:10:09,654 --> 00:10:12,350
Well, not right now.

141
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:22,425
l'm gonna go to bed. The fumes
are giving me a headache. So....

142
00:10:27,172 --> 00:10:29,504
Good night, bro.

143
00:10:30,074 --> 00:10:31,268
Good night.

144
00:10:35,713 --> 00:10:36,839
Here.

145
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:38,880
Just in case.

146
00:10:39,617 --> 00:10:41,710
Oh, excellent!

147
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:58,457
-What kind of karate is that?
-No kind.

148
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:01,896
He just makes it up.

149
00:11:02,307 --> 00:11:06,073
-How's it going with you guys?
-So far it kind of blows.

150
00:11:10,148 --> 00:11:13,606
l don't know, l just thought
he'd feel more like a brother.

151
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:16,251
Like you and Ross.
Close and connected and....

152
00:11:16,421 --> 00:11:19,151
Honey, we're close now.
You wouldn't believe the years...

153
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:25,388
...of noogies and wedgies and flying
wedgies and atomic wedgies and....

154
00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:28,259
That's when the waistband
goes over your head.

155
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:33,567
We drove each other crazy
playing the shadow game.

156
00:11:33,738 --> 00:11:36,707
-How do you play the shadow game?
-How do you play the shadow game?

157
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:39,069
-l just asked you.
-l just asked you.

158
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:41,337
l don't have time for this.

159
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:42,843
That is what the game is.

160
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:46,245
You just gave up really quickly.

161
00:11:47,885 --> 00:11:49,546
-You seen Joey?
-What's the matter?

162
00:11:49,787 --> 00:11:52,347
Just this!

163
00:11:57,028 --> 00:12:01,761
lt's my fault, really, because the
couch is where we keep the varnish.

164
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:05,967
Somebody wanna hand me
one of those tiles?

165
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:11,135
-What's going on?
-He's retiling my floor.

166
00:12:12,343 --> 00:12:14,208
Spackle boy!

167
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:16,307
Get up!

168
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:20,076
-You started this, you will finish it!
-He started mine first!

169
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:23,186
Build the unit, Cinderellie
Lay the tile, Cinderellie

170
00:12:28,693 --> 00:12:32,151
-He was helping me first.
-No, l need a bathroom. l'm a girl!

171
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,321
You guys figure it out.
l'm taking a break.

172
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:36,364
-That's good.
-Take a break?

173
00:12:36,534 --> 00:12:39,196
Yeah. l think even God
rested on the seventh day.

174
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:41,767
Joey, if this takes seven days...

175
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:45,932
...you'll be able to meet God
and ask him about it yourself.

176
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,080
Big octopus.

177
00:13:03,361 --> 00:13:06,262
Oh, my God! l totally forgot.

178
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,831
Well, can't someone else do it?

179
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,366
But l have company.

180
00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:17,336
Look, that's all right.
l'll come in. Okay.

181
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:20,376
l'm sorry,
but l have to go into work.

182
00:13:20,611 --> 00:13:24,274
lt's one of my regulars.
He's insisting that l do him, so....

183
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:26,849
Hey, what kind of work do you do?

184
00:13:27,318 --> 00:13:30,719
l'm a masseuse.
l give people massages and stuff.

185
00:13:30,888 --> 00:13:34,790
You work at one of
those massage parlors?

186
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:39,160
Well, you know, we don't call it that.
But, yeah.

187
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:44,392
That's wild.

188
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:48,765
-No, l had no idea.
-Alrighty.

189
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:53,440
l'll be back in a little bit.
Unless you want to come with me.

190
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:55,545
You mean, like, watch?

191
00:13:56,514 --> 00:14:00,712
No. No, you can get one yourself.
lt'll be on the house.

192
00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:02,876
What are big sisters for?

193
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:06,313
Well, l don't think this. You know?

194
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:08,550
No. No, no.
l wouldn't do you myself.

195
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,660
l mean, that would be weird.

196
00:14:12,096 --> 00:14:14,496
l'll get one of the
other girls to do it.

197
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:17,225
This is so much fun!

198
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:20,262
-Are you excited?
-Yeah.

199
00:14:22,106 --> 00:14:25,473
Hey, do Monica and Rachel
work there?

200
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:29,245
lt's beautiful!

201
00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:32,941
lt's like the first bathroom
floor there ever was.

202
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:37,220
What are you going in there for?

203
00:14:37,388 --> 00:14:39,253
You want, like, a number?

204
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:45,218
-Hey.
-Hi. Bye.

205
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:49,291
Okay. l'm done with my choices.

206
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,934
These are final.

207
00:14:52,904 --> 00:14:55,998
-Well, it's about time.
-Yeah. Very official.

208
00:14:56,174 --> 00:15:00,372
Yeah. Well, you know, Chandler
printed it up on his computer.

209
00:15:00,545 --> 00:15:02,979
And who laminated it?

210
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:06,006
That was me.

211
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:07,879
All right, let me see.

212
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,285
''Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder,
Elizabeth Hurley...

213
00:15:12,557 --> 00:15:13,854
...Michelle Pfeiffer...

214
00:15:14,892 --> 00:15:17,554
...Dorothy Hamill''?

215
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:24,834
Hey, it's my list!

216
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:29,097
You do realize she only spins
like that on ice?

217
00:15:37,982 --> 00:15:40,473
-What's going on?
-She broke my arm!

218
00:15:40,651 --> 00:15:43,484
-He touched my fanny.
-She touched mine first!

219
00:15:43,654 --> 00:15:45,144
That's my job!

220
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:50,488
So, what's the deal? l can have sex
with you, but l can't touch you?

221
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:54,062
-You can't have sex with her!
-Did you think l was a hooker?

222
00:15:54,232 --> 00:15:58,965
No, okay. l know. You're a masseuse.
lt's cool. l'm not a cop!

223
00:16:01,105 --> 00:16:04,199
Ask Mr. Wiffler if he
can wait for five minutes.

224
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,842
Fine.

225
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,410
l don't like you.

226
00:16:09,447 --> 00:16:13,076
So that's what you thought l did?
God!

227
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:15,481
That's not what l do!

228
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,912
Wait, that's not what you do?

229
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,081
No!

230
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:22,817
Why would you think that?

231
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:26,361
l don't know. This is the city,
you know? l just....

232
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:27,893
l mean...

233
00:16:28,099 --> 00:16:29,498
...l don't know.

234
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:34,937
Whatever. lt's the perfect end
to the perfect weekend anyway.

235
00:16:36,307 --> 00:16:37,535
Wait.

236
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,405
No, you're right.
No, it was perfect.

237
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:45,276
l can't believe
l screwed it up so bad.

238
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,886
-You thought it was perfect?
-Well, no, maybe it wasn't perfect...

239
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:52,749
...but you know, it was pretty cool,
you know?

240
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:56,792
Because we had all those
great talks, you know?

241
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:03,095
Which ones in particular
were great for you?

242
00:17:04,068 --> 00:17:06,730
Well, you know, about
the tongue thing, you know?

243
00:17:06,938 --> 00:17:10,601
And how l told you about
my likes and my dislikes.

244
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:17,272
How l like to melt stuff, and how
l dislike stuff that doesn't melt.

245
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,579
Right. Okay.

246
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:27,088
l feel like l can really talk to you
because you're my sister, you know?

247
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:31,054
Yeah. l guess l do.

248
00:17:31,228 --> 00:17:35,460
And then l go feel your friend up
and make you mad at me.

249
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:39,996
Well, l wasn't hopping mad,
you know?

250
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:43,067
You hopped a little bit.

251
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:47,773
Yeah, l'm really sorry.
You know, l'm really....

252
00:17:48,713 --> 00:17:50,647
Okay.

253
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:55,945
Well, this is my favorite part
of the weekend. Right now. This.

254
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,951
This?

255
00:17:58,122 --> 00:18:00,556
Oh, come on.
We went to Times Square.

256
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,851
We found ninja stars. l almost
get my arm broken by a hooker--

257
00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:05,926
She's not a hooker.

258
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:09,658
When l tell my friends about her,
she will be.

259
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,835
Phoebe, what's that?

260
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:25,176
Frank Jr. gave me this before he left.
A present.

261
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:27,817
lt used to belong to our dad.
His garage-door opener.

262
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:30,146
Until Frank melted it.

263
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,080
Cool!

264
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:42,659
Sound the bell, gather up
all the men you can find.

265
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,859
We got ourselves
an entertainment unit raising.

266
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:50,866
No, seriously,
can you help us?

267
00:18:54,145 --> 00:18:55,840
Okay, on three!

268
00:18:56,013 --> 00:18:59,744
-One, two--
-Why don't we just go on two?

269
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:02,579
-Why two?
-Because it's faster.

270
00:19:02,753 --> 00:19:06,052
l could've counted to three four times
without all the two talk.

271
00:19:06,223 --> 00:19:11,627
-All right, but in the future--
-Heavy thing! Not getting lighter!

272
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:15,755
-One, two--
-So we are going with two?

273
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:27,639
A good job, Joe.

274
00:19:27,812 --> 00:19:30,542
Wow. lt's big.

275
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,314
So big it actually makes
our doors look smaller.

276
00:19:36,153 --> 00:19:40,317
-Maybe my ruler's wrong.
-Maybe all the rulers are wrong.

277
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:45,485
lt's not that bad. So it blocks a
little of your door, a little of mine.

278
00:19:45,696 --> 00:19:46,822
l got a better idea.

279
00:19:46,997 --> 00:19:50,592
How about it blocks none of my door
and a lot of your door?

280
00:19:53,804 --> 00:19:58,138
Listen, before l forget,
that side is still wet.

281
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:08,514
Arm hair stuck!
Arm hair stuck!

282
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,551
Let me just see
if l've got this right.

283
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:19,162
So this is a half-caf, double-tall,
easy hazelnut...

284
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:24,427
...nonfat, no foam, with whip,
extra-hot latte, right?

285
00:20:24,602 --> 00:20:26,035
Okay. Great.

286
00:20:26,737 --> 00:20:28,466
You freak.

287
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:35,537
Thank you.

288
00:20:35,713 --> 00:20:37,977
A coffee to go, please.

289
00:20:41,585 --> 00:20:45,817
-lsabella Rossellini!
-Are you serious? Oh, my God!

290
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:49,584
Damn! l cannot believe
l took her off my list.

291
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,729
Why? Because otherwise
you'd go for it?

292
00:20:54,698 --> 00:20:56,723
Yeah, maybe.

293
00:20:56,901 --> 00:20:58,732
You lie.

294
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:00,968
You don't think l'd go up to her?

295
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:06,235
lt took you 1 0 years to finally admit
you liked me.

296
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:12,415
Yeah? Well, missy, you better be glad
that list is laminated.

297
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:16,917
You know what, honey? You go ahead.
We'll call her an alternate.

298
00:21:17,822 --> 00:21:21,690
-Okay. Hold my cruller.
-Okay.

299
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:24,560
Are you really gonna
let him do this?

300
00:21:24,728 --> 00:21:27,253
He's about to go hit
on lsabella Rossellini.

301
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:30,093
l'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.

302
00:21:35,306 --> 00:21:36,796
l'm Ross.

303
00:21:36,974 --> 00:21:40,671
You don't know me,
but l'm a big, big fan of yours.

304
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:42,278
l mean...

305
00:21:42,446 --> 00:21:43,811
...Blue Velvet.

306
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:50,851
l was wondering if l could maybe
buy you a cup of coffee.

307
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:53,489
Or reimburse you for that one.

308
00:21:55,526 --> 00:21:57,756
Aren't you with that girl over there?

309
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,960
Well, yeah, kind of.

310
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:06,864
But that's okay.
We have an understanding.

311
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:12,031
We each have this list of five famous
people, and you were one of mine.

312
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:14,905
So l'm allowed to sleep with you.

313
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:17,843
No, no, no.
lt's flattering.

314
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:24,378
-l don't know--
-Wait. Wait, lsabella.

315
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:29,082
Don't dismiss this so fast. This is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

316
00:22:29,293 --> 00:22:31,420
Yeah, for you.

317
00:22:32,796 --> 00:22:34,593
-ls that the list?
-Yes.

318
00:22:34,765 --> 00:22:36,426
-Can l see it?
-No.

319
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,898
-Come on.
-But-- Okay.

320
00:22:39,536 --> 00:22:41,094
l'm not on the list!

321
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:43,502
But that's not the final draft.

322
00:22:44,074 --> 00:22:45,974
lt's laminated.

323
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:50,574
Okay, see, you were on my list.

324
00:22:50,781 --> 00:22:53,215
But then my friend Chandler...

325
00:22:56,086 --> 00:22:59,214
...brought up the very good point
that you are international.

326
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,655
So l bumped you for Winona Ryder.
Local.

327
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,652
You know, it's ironic
because l have a list...

328
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,731
...of five goofy coffeehouse guys.

329
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:15,304
And yesterday, l just bumped you
for that guy over there.

330
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,513
We're just gonna be friends.

331
00:23:28,485 --> 00:23:30,783
You know what?

332
00:23:30,955 --> 00:23:33,856
Bet you l could fit in there.

333
00:23:34,992 --> 00:23:37,552
l got 5 bucks says you can't.

334
00:23:38,796 --> 00:23:41,094
Get out your checkbook, mister.

335
00:23:41,732 --> 00:23:44,394
l think l have the cash.

336
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,701
You are dog, man!

337
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:54,673
l totally fit!

338
00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:56,972
