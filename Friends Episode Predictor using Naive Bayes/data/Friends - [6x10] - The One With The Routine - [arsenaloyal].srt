1
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:06,702
Why is everybody using
these tiny, little lights nowadays?

2
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:08,998
I remember when people used big ones.

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,700
That's a good story, Grandpa.

4
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:19,541
Wow. Monica's letting other people
help decorate her tree?

5
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:22,049
Did someone get her
drunk again, or...?

6
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:26,817
Having a perfect tree is
not what Christmas is about.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,957
It's about being with loved ones.

8
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,686
That is nice. And we're done.
Ta-da!

9
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,996
It just doesn't quite
feel like Christmas to me.

10
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,567
Oh, here.

11
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,638
See, now it feels like Christmas.

12
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,605
The One With The Routine

13
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,541
And that's the story of the dreidel.

14
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:32,556
Some people trace the Christmas tree
to the Egyptians...

15
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,458
who'd bring palm branches into huts
on the shortest day of the year...

16
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,255
symbolizing life's
triumph over death.

17
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:43,434
And that was, like, 4000 years ago.

18
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:47,366
Around the same time
that you started this story.

19
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,904
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey. What's up?

20
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:57,412
I had to get out of the apartment.
Janine's stretching all over.

21
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,708
Everywhere I look she's like....

22
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,550
I can see why that's hard to resist.

23
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,061
I like her so much.

24
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,092
I'm sorry she doesn't feel the same.

25
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,060
I know. And she's so sweet.

26
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,962
I just want to feed her grapes
and brush her hair.

27
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,633
You are aware that she's
not a monkey, right?

28
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,235
I am so over Janine.

29
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,940
Yeah, at first I thought she was hot,
but now she's like old news.

30
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,917
-Hey, guys.
-Janine!

31
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,584
I'm gonna be a dancer on a TV special
for New Year's Eve.

32
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:44,752
It's called some sort of
Dickin' Rockin' Dicky Eve.

33
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,099
Hold it.

34
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:53,094
Are you talking about
Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve?

35
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,171
Yeah, that's what I said.

36
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,543
Oh, my God, we love that show!

37
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,805
Ross and I have been watching it
since I can remember.

38
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,451
You're still just a little
fat girl inside, aren't you?

39
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,184
I'm gonna be one of the party people.

40
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:17,224
You're gonna be a party person?
Those guys rock the most!

41
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,064
They said to bring someone.
Want to be my dance partner?

42
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,997
I would love to spend
New Year's with you.

43
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,035
They're taping tomorrow.
I don't understand why..

44
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,706
Well, how it works is...

45
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,708
the part with Dick Clark
in Times Square is actually live.

46
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,005
But they tape some of the party stuff
ahead of time.

47
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,581
Not a lot of people know that.

48
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,714
Do you guys want to come too?

49
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:45,582
-Are you serious?
-We are there!

50
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,754
What are you laughing at?

51
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,932
Well, I used to date him,
but you're still going out with her.

52
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,430
Thanks.
Great, so we can all go together.

53
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,607
I gotta run. I'll catch you later.

54
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,200
Bye, Janine.

55
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,205
Did she just ask me out on a date?

56
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,079
I don't think so.

57
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,719
She invited him to the biggest
party of the millennium.

58
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,515
Yeah, but she also invited
you and Ross.

59
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,922
I'm sorry, I don't think that
that was a romantic thing.

60
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,063
Well, maybe.
But, hey, I know how I can find out.

61
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,027
It's a New Year's Eve party.

62
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,704
So at midnight, I can kiss her.
And if she kisses me back, great.

63
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,737
If she says, "What are you doing?"

64
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,738
I can say, "lt wasn't me,
it was New Year's."

65
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,475
That's better than Ross
kissing me in high school...

66
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:46,276
and saying that he did it
because he needed Chap Stick.

67
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,453
It was a dry day.

68
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:58,229
We are going to Dick Clark's
New Year's Rockin' Eve!

69
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,296
Oh, my God!

70
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,559
Oh, my God!

71
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,764
Oh, my God!

72
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,136
Okay, I've been on sets before...

73
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,109
so let me give you some advice.

74
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,683
It's a show, but we're just dancing.
It's no big deal.

75
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,978
Important thing to remember:
Stay cool.

76
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,848
-Got it.
-Okay.

77
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,188
Oh, my God!
It's just like I dreamed it!

78
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,826
Everyone! Gather up!

79
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,825
-Excuse us!
-Excuse us!

80
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,629
The music's gonna start,
you're gonna dance...

81
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,964
we'll tape it. Don't look
at the camera. Questions?

82
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,870
Yeah, I have a question.
When is this gonna air?

83
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,871
Yeah. Now, you guys dance
over there...

84
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,844
you guys, over there.
I want you two here.

85
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,313
Everyone else, spread out.

86
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,421
We'd rather not dance together
because we're brother and sister.

87
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,250
Yeah, it would seem kind of weird.

88
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:03,589
As weird as coming all the way down here
and then having to go home right now?

89
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,763
So when is it gonna air?

90
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,437
You look in the kitchen,
I got the closet.

91
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,973
I can save you time, ladies.
I'm right here.

92
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:23,809
Yeah. Why don't you take a walk?
This doesn't concern you.

93
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,317
We're looking for our presents
from Monica.

94
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,815
That's terrible.

95
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,680
No, we do it every year.

96
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,390
Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.

97
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,418
Yeah, we never find them.

98
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:40,530
She's always bested us,
that wily...minx.

99
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,358
We'll search here for an hour...

100
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,265
and then we'll go to Joey's
and search, okay?

101
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,872
-You can't look for Monica's presents.
-We have to.

102
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:54,240
You don't have to. And you can't,
because I live here too.

103
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,044
Well, then you should look with us.

104
00:06:58,785 --> 00:06:59,774
Why?

105
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,580
Aren't you worried about
what to get Monica?

106
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,050
No, I have a great idea
for her present.

107
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,260
Oh, that's it?
A great idea? Oh, yeah?

108
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,057
What if she gets you
a great present...

109
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,425
two mediums
and lots of little ones...

110
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:17,797
and you just get her one present?
She'll feel bad.

111
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,595
Why would you do that to her?
Why? Why?

112
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,735
-If I help, we can find them faster!
-Right!

113
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,437
We have a live one!

114
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,310
-Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
-Yeah.

115
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,876
Who's it for?

116
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:40,752
"Dear losers, do you really think
I'd hide presents under the couch?

117
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,794
P.S. Chandler,
I knew they'd break you."

118
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,728
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.

119
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,631
We are so gonna find them this year.

120
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:58,641
You said you'd go across the hall
and look. Do you do that every year?

121
00:07:58,845 --> 00:07:59,937
Yeah.

122
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,841
You don't go into the back
of my closet...

123
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,481
and look under my gym bag
or anything?

124
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,677
-No. Never do that.
-No.

125
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,954
That's where Joey gave me stuff
to store that I've never seen.

126
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,756
Okay, that did not just happen.

127
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,929
Here comes a camera.

128
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,201
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.

129
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,947
Why do they keep doing that?

130
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,023
We have to get up on one
of those platforms.

131
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,954
They've been taping them all day.

132
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,354
Right.

133
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,566
What'd you guys do
to get up on there?

134
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,361
We learned how to dance.

135
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,400
When you learned to dance, did you
forget how to put on underpants?

136
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,271
Yeah!

137
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,818
-Hey, you're a good dancer.
-Really?

138
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,213
You'd be better if you
loosened your hips.

139
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,150
-What do you mean?
-Like this.

140
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:23,689
That's it. Feel the rhythm.
That's better.

141
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,098
You're dancing with her.

142
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,869
-We're together.
-Yeah, we came together.

143
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,104
I don't see it.

144
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,498
You are dancing with the tall guy.
Tall guy, raise your hand!

145
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:43,241
Hey, buddy. Let me dance with her.
I like her, and I think I have a shot.

146
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,609
Really, you think so? I don't.

147
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,394
I couldn't find anything..
Hey, wait!

148
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,729
Yeah, we found them.

149
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,996
They were in the guest-room closet.

150
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,332
You have nothing to worry about
because they're crap.

151
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,238
Those are mine.
I got those for you.

152
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,908
Oh. Thanks, Chandler, they're great!

153
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:26,352
Chandler, what is this very weird
metal A-Z thing?

154
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,822
Those are bookends.
That's a great gift.

155
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,259
Oh. Okay, I'm sorry.
Thank you for my "az."

156
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,937
Make sure you put all that stuff
back in the closet.

157
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,433
Yes, okay.

158
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:45,166
By the way, I think it's really nice
of you that even after you moved...

159
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:48,208
you still keep storing
that stuff for Joey.

160
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,790
Hey, dancing girl?

161
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,334
Can I go to the bathroom?

162
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,504
Here we go. Yeah.

163
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,210
Looking good, Gellers!

164
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,879
We know!

165
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,211
That snippy guy's the one who
decides who gets on the platform.

166
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,182
-We should go dance by him.
-Okay.

167
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,194
Okay, everybody, hold!

168
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,764
Next on the platforms are....

169
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,537
You two! And....

170
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,438
-You two!
-Cool!

171
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,841
Excuse me, sir?

172
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,246
Would it help if I weren't
wearing underpants?

173
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,942
Monica!

174
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,212
Would it?

175
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,319
How about me?

176
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,561
Hey, tall guy!

177
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,930
I want to talk to you about that girl
you're dancing with.

178
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:24,904
She's nice, huh? To think I almost
brought my wife to this.

179
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,603
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

180
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,748
Look, I came with that girl, okay?

181
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,615
I plan to kiss her
at the New Year's countdown.

182
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,584
I'm trying to win her over. I..

183
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,348
I don't think so.

184
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,423
You can dance with my partner.

185
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,720
She's real mellow.

186
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:49,558
Look, you dating this girl
you came with?

187
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,270
I was hoping after tonight
that maybe I could....

188
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,802
No. No. She's fair game
if you ask me. Sorry, buddy.

189
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,436
All right. Hey.

190
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,074
Fair is fair. When you're right,
you're right. What can I say?

191
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,984
Are you in second grade?

192
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,983
Hey, man, you're the one
who wet his pants.

193
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,820
Monica would not
hide the presents down here.

194
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,265
No, but she did. Look, there's
that old hippie I've always wanted.

195
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,974
If they are here,
Gunther knows about it.

196
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:33,805
And I could get it out of him.
He's had a huge crush on me.

197
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,278
That's not fair to play with his head,
though. You do it.

198
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,110
Okay.

199
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,584
Hey, Gunther.

200
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,016
Hi.

201
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:49,093
Getting to be that holiday time again, huh?

202
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,162
Yes, it's like a miracle.

203
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:57,428
I was thinking, since it's the time
of giving gifts...

204
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:01,039
I was wondering, are there any
presents around here for me?

205
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,142
You know what I mean?

206
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:08,572
-I think I found them.
-That's the Toys for Tots collection bin.

207
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:13,684
-That's awfully convenient, don't you think?
-For the tots it is.

208
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,354
-Hey, you guys, guess what.
-Did you find them?

209
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,617
No, Gunther fainted.

210
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,026
Man, this sucks.

211
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,564
If Mom and Dad don't see us
on TV after we made them jealous...

212
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,999
then who's gonna be
the losers then?

213
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,538
I know what'll get us up
on a platform.

214
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,243
What?

215
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,878
The routine!

216
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,349
We haven't done the routine
since middle school.

217
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,917
When the snippy guy
sees the routine...

218
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,621
he'll want to build us
our own platform.

219
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,118
Was it that good?

220
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,452
We got honorable mention in the
brother/sister dance category!

221
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,220
It's almost fake midnight.
Do we really have any other choice?

222
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,630
Okay, let's do it.

223
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,196
Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!

224
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,771
Five, six, seven, eight!

225
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:02,151
So do we really need to ask who's
going up on the platform next?

226
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,362
You get up there and do that
again, exactly like that.

227
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,262
Get this. Dick will want
it for the Bloopers show.

228
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,001
All right, cut!
Listen up, everyone!

229
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,369
When we start again,
it'll be the countdown...

230
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,646
so I want to see
everybody's excitement!

231
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,207
Hey, guy!

232
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,473
You got three seconds to get away.

233
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,049
What's going on here?

234
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,480
Take a look at the guy's pants!

235
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:34,215
You told us to show excitement,
but don't you think he went overboard?

236
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,488
What's the matter with you? Go!

237
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,721
Yeah, take a hike, wet pants!

238
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,665
Can you believe this?

239
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,063
We're on the platform
for the millennial moment!

240
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,465
I know!

241
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,733
You haven't been practicing
the routine, have you?

242
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,701
No.

243
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,469
Me too!

244
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,747
When the music starts...

245
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,043
I was thinking about maybe
going into the robot.

246
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,989
Ross, we should stick to the routine.
We don't want to look stupid.

247
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,689
All right, we're back!
Ten seconds left.

248
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:16,059
-Ten.
-Nine, eight.

249
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,669
-Seven.
-Okay, it all comes down to this.

250
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,931
Whatever happens, happens.

251
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,239
Destiny.

252
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,503
three, two, one!

253
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,510
-Cut!
-No!

254
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,446
Year!

255
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,348
Happy "No" Year!

256
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,588
Now we go to the live shot
of Times Square. That's a wrap!

257
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,868
What did that snippy guy say?

258
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,335
I think he's kicking out
anyone who's not dancing.

259
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,667
So just keep dancing.

260
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,415
Hey, look who I found.

261
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,054
Oh, hi, guys!

262
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,191
Birds have a very good
sense of direction.

263
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,294
I thought maybe they could help us
find the presents.

264
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,890
Yes, if the presents are hidden
south for the winter.

265
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:27,566
Or we could just follow your clever
jokes. Any ideas? Didn't think so.

266
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,808
Come on, show us where
the presents are.

267
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:35,046
The duck seems to think that
Monica got me garbage.

268
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,943
I wonder what I could get Monica
that's as good as garbage.

269
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,546
How about my "az"?

270
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:50,024
-Hey. This is hollow.
-What?

271
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:53,961
This bench, it's hollow.
I can't believe I never knew that!

272
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,898
-Oh, the presents!
-Don't look directly at them!

273
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:01,930
What?

274
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,608
All right, no, we could look at them.

275
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,277
This one's for me!

276
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,776
This one's for Chandler. Here.

277
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,508
-And the big one's for me!
-Oh, let's open them!

278
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,915
-Wait a minute. We can't do this.
-Why?

279
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,488
I don't want to know
what Monica got me.

280
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:24,423
I'm sure she worked hard at getting it
and wanting to surprise me.

281
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,654
And you guys are gonna ruin that.

282
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:30,197
We have to put these back.
This is not what Christmas is about.

283
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,661
Whatever, Linus.
I'm opening mine.

284
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:39,839
Nobody is opening anything, okay?

285
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:43,842
I want to see the look on her face
when I give her my present.

286
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,608
I'm sure she wants to see the look
on my face when I get mine.

287
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,653
So, please, please, can we just...?
Can we put them back?

288
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,057
-Will you get us better gifts?
-Fine.

289
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,827
Hey, guys.

290
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,523
You found the presents?

291
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,969
You let them find the presents?

292
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,261
Great.

293
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:10,306
Do you know how long it took me
to find you that water purifier?

294
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,873
-That's what you got me?
-Yes, I see. That look is priceless.

295
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,650
Home sweet home, huh?

296
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,515
Nice to get back to reality.

297
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,820
Plus, we know how the New Year's
gonna go off.

298
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,666
I guess there's no reason for all
that Y2K panic, you know?

299
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,333
Anyway, good night.

300
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,867
-Joey?
-Yeah?

301
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,775
Three...

302
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,339
two, one.

303
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,221
Happy New Year.

304
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,619
What was that for?

305
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,260
Tonight when they yelled "cut"
and we didn't get to kiss...

306
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,426
I was really, really disappointed,
and I just....

307
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,929
I just really wanted to kiss you.

308
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,806
Really?

309
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:22,270
In the moment, I really wanted
to kiss you too. In the moment.

310
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,214
-In the moment.
-But only in the moment.

311
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:31,449
So do you want to kiss again?

312
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,385
Sure. New Year's Eve
is only two weeks away.

313
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,818
Can you wait?

314
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,729
No.

315
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,793
Me neither.

316
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,769
Three, two....

317
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,304
You don't have to count down
every time we kiss.

318
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,475
Oh. Okay.

319
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:58,506
Except I sort of felt like I needed
a couple seconds to get ready.

320
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:24,698
We were on the platform, ready to
dance into the new millennium...

321
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,640
and the guy yells, "Cut!"

322
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:33,543
-So Joey didn't get to kiss Janine?
-Nope, he sure didn't.

323
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:37,246
I guess that means
that you guys are still tied.

324
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:41,483
I don't know about that.
I think she saw us do our routine.

325
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,323
I may have boogied right into first place.

326
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:49,799
So you guys are telling me
that you actually did...

327
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,562
the routine from eighth grade?

328
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:56,333
Yeah! But of course we had
to update it a little bit.

329
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,510
Hey, by the way, quick thinking
about catching me.

330
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,407
There's no way you could've
done the end...

331
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,014
the way you guys did it back then.

332
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:10,477
What? We could do it.

333
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:15,693
I don't know. You were a lot bigger..
I mean, stronger back then.

334
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,290
I can do it, okay?

335
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:22,030
Come on, let's go! Come on.

336
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,996
One, two, three, four...

337
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,796
five, six, seven, eight.

338
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,529
I can't do it!

339
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:35,005
Now, you do that, you're on TV.
