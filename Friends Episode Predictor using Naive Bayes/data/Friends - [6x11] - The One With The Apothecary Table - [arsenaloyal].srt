1
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:07,334
Listen....

2
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,667
You think I have a chance with Janine?

3
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:11,642
We've been through this.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,278
Don't do this to yourself.

5
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,912
She made it clear it isn't
going to happen.

6
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:19,574
All right, then. I guess I shouldn't
get too excited...

7
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,378
that I just kissed her!

8
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:23,782
-Are you serious?
-That's great!

9
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,756
Yeah, well, we'll see.

10
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:28,951
You kissed her?

11
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,091
We kissed it up real nice.

12
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:36,135
So you ended up with Janine.

13
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:39,863
Well, congratulations,
you won fair and square.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,305
Yeah, it was real neck and neck
there for awhile.

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,910
So you kissed. Then what happened?

16
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,640
I came over here to tell you guys.

17
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,707
So she's waiting over
there for you?

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,478
Yeah.

19
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,394
The One With The Apothecary Table

20
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,359
-I gotta go.
-Okay.

21
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,130
I'm gonna be late
for dance class.

22
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,397
Okay.

23
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,538
-Okay, now I'm really leaving.
-All right.

24
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:53,871
But can you just...

25
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,048
just leave your lips?

26
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,279
Have you kissed her yet?

27
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:07,749
It's awesome!

28
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,428
I could do it forever.

29
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:14,360
You know what? She kisses better
than my mom cooks.

30
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,297
I'm so glad you said, "cooks."

31
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:22,470
Look, it's like
imagine your best kiss ever.

32
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:26,203
Right? Okay, now multiply that
by, like, 10.

33
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,480
Wait a second, you dated Ross.

34
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,884
And you date Chandler.
Okay, multiply it by, like, 50.

35
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:41,685
Rachel, you've got to tell
the post office that you've moved.

36
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,029
We still get your bills and stuff.

37
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,796
Pottery Barn!
You can throw the rest away.

38
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,101
I'm not your garbage man.

39
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,063
I'm your mailman.

40
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,031
Monica, look.

41
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,038
Here is that table that I ordered.

42
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:03,543
-You got it from Pottery Barn?
-Yeah. It's an apothecary table.

43
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,011
Does anyone even know what
an apothecary is?

44
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,914
A pharmacist.

45
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,144
"A pharmacist."

46
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,757
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.

47
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,561
I hate Pottery Barn too.

48
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,889
They kicked me out just
because I sat on a bed.

49
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,862
You took off your pants and
got under the sheets.

50
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,831
I was tired.

51
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,837
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?

52
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,944
She hates mass-produced stuff.

53
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:36,046
She thinks her furniture should
have a story behind it.

54
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,250
This has a story behind it.

55
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:42,716
They had to ship it all the way
from the White Plains store.

56
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,719
It's got to be one-of-a-kind.

57
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,963
Like that God-awful ceramic fruit
bowl she has on her counter?

58
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:55,031
Hey! I made that for her.

59
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,036
-You made pottery?
-Yeah.

60
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,298
I made it out of a fruit bowl
I found in the garbage.

61
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,205
If you put that in her apartment,
you'll never hear the end of it.

62
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,608
I'll tell her that it's an antique.

63
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,373
She doesn't have to know
where it came from.

64
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,715
I love these little drawers.

65
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,822
Oh, look! It says that
it holds 300 CDs.

66
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:21,083
Just like the apothecary tables
of yore.

67
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,390
Your what?

68
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,364
-What?
-What?

69
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,331
Enjoy the catalog, sweetheart.

70
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:37,835
So the farmer says:

71
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,978
"That's not a cow,
and you're not milking."

72
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,813
I'm so glad you're together.

73
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,214
We wanted a couple to go out with,
and now we have one.

74
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,351
We're a couple of couples.

75
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,560
I had so much fun tonight.
What a great restaurant!

76
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:58,490
And, Chandler, I can't believe
I let you pay for this one.

77
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,526
Thanks again, man.

78
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,872
If you come over tomorrow,
I'll make pasta.

79
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,506
-That'd be great!
-Okay.

80
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,109
But at least let us
bring the wine.

81
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,744
-You don't have to.
-I insist.

82
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,941
-You'll get the wine, right?
-Yeah.

83
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,952
-Okay, good night.
-See you tomorrow.

84
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,587
Can't wait.

85
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,091
How are we going to get
out of that one?

86
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,767
I can't handle two
nights in a row with them.

87
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,965
What's wrong with them?

88
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,938
They're just a little...

89
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,473
blah!

90
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,077
Blah?

91
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:54,319
Well, you know, he's blah.
She's just...

92
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,316
She's very loud for such
a small person.

93
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,093
They're my best friends.

94
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:06,823
Are you saying we can't go out?
Because that'd be a problem.

95
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,826
Of course we can still
hang out with them.

96
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,070
Just not two nights in a row.

97
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,068
-Okay?
-I guess.

98
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,800
Thank you.

99
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:26,278
I'll sell my friends and use
the money to buy you presents.

100
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:38,530
What a great table!
Where did you get it?

101
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,464
Guess.

102
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,298
A flea market?

103
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,461
I knew you would get it
on the first guess.

104
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:51,499
Isn't it cool?
It's an apothecary table.

105
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,340
You can just imagine
that this is where...

106
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,209
they kept all their stuff
to make potions.

107
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,379
You can almost smell the opium.

108
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:05,783
Almost.

109
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,284
How much was it?

110
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,050
Just only 500 bucks.

111
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,990
Five hundred bucks at a flea market?

112
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,666
I thought you meant how much was it...

113
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,901
when it was new, back then.

114
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,531
It was at a flea market,
so it was like a dollar.

115
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,138
-A dollar?
-And 50?

116
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,039
So it was like
one and 50 dollars.

117
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,209
-They gave you the old-time pricing.
-Yeah.

118
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,048
Well, what period is it from?

119
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,853
It's from yore.

120
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,217
Like the "days of yore," you know?

121
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,653
Yes, I do.

122
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,057
-It's just perfect.
-Oh, good.

123
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,390
I bet it has a great story too.

124
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,728
Did they tell you
where it's from or...?

125
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:54,495
Yes, that I know.
This is from White Plains.

126
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,405
White Plains.

127
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,544
It sounds like such a magical place.

128
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,610
-I'm here.
-Hi!

129
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,181
Oh, my God!

130
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,117
-You like it?
-Oh, my God!

131
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,019
It's my new apothecary table!

132
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,422
Phoebe will be here any second.
She can't see this.

133
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,394
Why not? She'll love it.
It's the real thing.

134
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,295
I got it at Pottery Barn.

135
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,394
I know. I bought the same one.

136
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,302
And if she sees your table,
she'll know I lied.

137
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,204
-I said ours was an original.
-Why?

138
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,402
Because she hates Pottery Barn.

139
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,947
She hates Pottery Barn?

140
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,809
She says it's all mass-produced...

141
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:44,955
nothing is authentic, and everyone
winds up having the same stuff.

142
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,819
So come on!
Can we cover this up, please?

143
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,225
I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe.

144
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,732
Although I did get some great
Pottery Barn sheets.

145
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,232
I forgot they made sheets!

146
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,146
I still can't believe
she hates Pottery Barn.

147
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,005
It's not like she hates you.

148
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,274
Yeah, but Pottery Barn?

149
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,620
You know what I think?
She's just weird.

150
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:21,251
It's because she's a twin.
Twins are weird.

151
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,923
She's not weird. She likes
her stuff to be one-of-a-kind.

152
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,701
You know what's not one-of-a-kind?
A twin!

153
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,204
Let's turn out the lights
and watch the movie.

154
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,038
-Hey, cool sheet!
-You like it?

155
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,045
-You want to know where I got it?
-Sure.

156
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,649
At a flea market.

157
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,552
You buy your sheets
at a flea market?

158
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,821
Come on, you gotta loosen the
purse strings a little.

159
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,898
Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes.

160
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,795
Here is the wine to bring
over tonight.

161
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,232
You were also gonna
buy Monica flowers...

162
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:10,873
but you couldn't, because
you paid for dinner last night.

163
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,905
Thanks. But it's just
gonna be me tonight.

164
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:19,014
-What happened to Janine?
-She's really sick.

165
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,385
-That's too bad.
-Yeah, she's been in there all day.

166
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:26,217
High fever, nose problem.
It's...

167
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,757
phlegm, phlegm,
phlegm, phlegm, phlegm.

168
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,231
Monica! Chandler!

169
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:38,826
I'm sorry about tonight. I don't
know if Joey told you...

170
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:42,097
but I couldn't get out
of going to this play.

171
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:47,178
Have a great time, huh?

172
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,110
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.

173
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,910
Oh, no, she really is sick.

174
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,053
Then why is she going to a play?

175
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,622
Well, you know, "Starve a fever...

176
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,724
go to a play for a cold."

177
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,730
Why is Janine not coming
over for dinner?

178
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:12,063
She didn't want to hang out with
you guys two nights in a row.

179
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:13,430
I'm so sorry.

180
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,568
Why doesn't she want
to hang out with us?

181
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,873
Because she thinks that
you are blah.

182
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,710
And that you, Monica,
are too loud.

183
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,477
What?!

184
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,117
What?

185
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,484
So she just pretended to
have a good time?

186
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,627
She was lying to our faces?

187
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,126
I can't believe this.
Who is she to judge us?

188
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:43,767
-We couldn't have been nicer to her.
-And I am not blah. I am a hoot!

189
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,637
Come on, please, you guys.
Don't be mad.

190
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,501
I'm sure she said it...

191
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,075
because she was nervous because
you're my best friends.

192
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,270
And it was our first date.

193
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,347
Plus, she's really sick.

194
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,421
You said you made that up!

195
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,522
But isn't the sick thing
better than the play thing?

196
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:10,685
They're both good. I generally just
go with, "Monica's drunk again."

197
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,494
Come on, please just
give her another chance.

198
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:19,169
-She'll come around, I promise.
-Of course we will.

199
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:22,032
-Come on, we gotta make dinner.
-Okay.

200
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,102
I do not like that woman!

201
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,605
I can hear you!

202
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,849
I am loud!

203
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,726
Can you please not put your
feet up on my new..?

204
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,827
Old sheet.

205
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,393
Oh, sure.

206
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,898
My apothecary table!

207
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,700
-What?
-No!

208
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,705
-Where did you get this?
-At Pottery Barn, okay?

209
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,180
Oh, my God!

210
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:10,749
Pottery Barn has ripped off
the design of our antique!

211
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,349
If they've ripped off our table...

212
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:19,394
ours must be worth much more
than one and 50 dollars.

213
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,999
This doesn't even
smell like opium.

214
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,102
It smells like wine,
which you spilled.

215
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,272
And thanks for wrecking my sheet.

216
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:32,575
Ross, calm down. I'll give
you the 80 cents.

217
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,441
Okay, one more time.

218
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,515
Would you like some orange juice?

219
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:45,190
-Perfect decibel.
-I know!

220
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,592
What are you guys doing?

221
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:54,424
Nothing. We're just talking.
You know, blah-blah-blah.

222
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,259
Come on, you said you were gonna try.

223
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:02,132
I came over to invite you to
a movie with me and Janine.

224
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,035
-What do you say?
-I'd like to...

225
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,302
but I'm not sure if
we have the time.

226
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,114
Very funny. I don't know
what to do.

227
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,284
I really want you to get along.

228
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,213
Please come to the movie with us.
You owe me.

229
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,112
-We owe you?
-That's right.

230
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:20,292
I helped you out in the
start of your relationship.

231
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,652
I helped you sneak around
for six months.

232
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,690
I looked like an idiot.

233
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,387
And I was humiliated.

234
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,292
And I only made $200.

235
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,800
We didn't give you any money.

236
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,837
You don't think I know that?

237
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,409
I can't decide if it goes
better by the new chair...

238
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:46,810
the Sahara desk...

239
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,111
or the Parker console table.

240
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,812
I didn't know there was
a Pottery Barn up here.

241
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,454
-I know, I went a little crazy.
-A little?

242
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,494
Your place looks like page 72
of the catalog.

243
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,229
Look at that!

244
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:05,529
The ornamental birdcage!
Large.

245
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,366
Oh, Ross? Be careful.
That is very old.

246
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:15,876
Colonial bird merchants used to
bring their birds to market in that.

247
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,509
Fascinating.

248
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,117
Another amazing find!

249
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,791
-I bet this has a great story too.
-It does.

250
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:32,623
It is a room-separating apparatus
from Colonial times.

251
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,660
A lot of this stuff is from
the Colonial times.

252
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,737
What are some other
time periods, Rachel?

253
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:44,806
Well, there's yore.

254
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,174
And, you know, yesteryear.

255
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,812
Rachel has such a
good eye for this stuff.

256
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,421
Ross, if you ever decide
to redecorate...

257
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,852
and I think you should...

258
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,890
you should ask Rachel to help.

259
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,789
He doesn't need my help.

260
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:08,330
I think he's ready to get rid
of the.. What'd you call it?

261
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,330
The "cheap knockoffs
and dinosaur junk"?

262
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,103
Really?

263
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:22,270
You know, since you have such a
great sense of what I need..

264
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,572
Here's 60 bucks.

265
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:28,947
Why don't you take Phoebe down
to that Colonial flea market...

266
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,950
and get me some stuff.

267
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,555
I don't think Phoebe wants to come.

268
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,458
-I do want to.
-She does want to.

269
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,063
-She does want to.
-Yeah!

270
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,701
-I'm gonna get my purse.
-Okay.

271
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:48,796
Hey, can I have all this stuff
when she makes you throw it out?

272
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:53,104
Well, sure, and I'll show you
right where you can put it.

273
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:02,344
I guess the flea market was
just better last time.

274
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,681
Well, at least I got these
sheets for Ross.

275
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:10,258
Look at this. Pottery Barn.

276
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,259
You know what? Don't look at it.

277
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,865
-Seriously, don't look at it.
-Look!

278
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,103
There's the table
they stole from us.

279
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,361
Oh, those bastards! Let's go.

280
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:26,535
That fan kind of looks like ours
and the birdcage and...

281
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,810
Wait a second, this is our
exact living room!

282
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,176
No, it's not.

283
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,783
Come on, ours is totally different.

284
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,649
I mean, we don't have the..
We don't have that lamp.

285
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:43,825
And that screen is on
the other side.

286
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:48,026
Oh, my God. This is where you
got all our stuff.

287
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,734
Pottery Barn! Oh, my God!

288
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:53,861
Okay, I did, all right?
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:58,134
I wanted this stuff, and I know
how you feel about Pottery Barn.

290
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:01,210
-Come on, don't be mad.
-No, but I am mad.

291
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,746
Because this stuff is what's
wrong with the world...

292
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,974
and it's in my living room...

293
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,915
and all I can think about is
how I don't have that lamp!

294
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,255
Well, then, honey, buy the lamp.

295
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,721
We have that 60 bucks from Ross.

296
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,157
I can't! I can't!

297
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,225
Unless...

298
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:27,098
Are you saying you'd move out
if I didn't buy that lamp?

299
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,374
No, I'm not gonna move out!

300
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:33,671
But are you saying that you would
move out if I didn't buy that lamp?

301
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,515
-Yes! I would so move out.
-Then I don't have a choice.

302
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,379
-I have to buy that lamp!
-That's right.

303
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,581
But at least the apothecary
table's real.

304
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,928
This was great.
Didn't everybody have a great time?

305
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,894
I did. I really did,
and I've got to say...

306
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,503
I'm sorry if I was weird after
the last time we went out.

307
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,606
I guess I was just nervous.

308
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,436
-That's understandable.
-Don't worry about it.

309
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,906
So we can go out again?

310
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,377
-Absolutely.
-Well, good.

311
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,319
See?

312
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:18,647
Wasn't that fun?

313
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,789
We have got to move.

314
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,058
What?

315
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,555
I knew it!

316
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,797
You're not so quiet yourself, missy!

317
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,728
I'm blah? The only thing more
boring than modern dance...

318
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,234
is you talking about it.

319
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:38,932
"Oh, Chandler, I just lost
myself in the movement."

320
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,577
You know, I know you're talking...

321
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,513
but all I hear is,
"Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah."

322
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,916
All right, you and me!
Let's go right now!

323
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,418
All right, enough!

324
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:56,690
Enough! You two, go home.
I gotta talk to Janine.

325
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,156
I really think you could take her.

326
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,796
You better hope I don't
see you in the hallway!

327
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:08,630
All right.

328
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,138
Look, we got a little bit
of a problem here.

329
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,607
You can't my treat
my friends that way.

330
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:18,874
-They said stuff to me too.
-I know, I'll talk to them about it.

331
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,309
They mean so much to me.

332
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,851
They're like my family, you know?

333
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:27,285
If you guys are gonna be
fighting all the time....

334
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:32,324
I don't think we can be together.
It just can't work, okay?

335
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:33,862
It can't.

336
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:35,997
I'm very upset.

337
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:38,902
Okay.

338
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,332
Would it help if I apologized?

339
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,204
Yeah.

340
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,204
That'd be very helpful.

341
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,843
What did I tell you about the hall?

342
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,886
I was coming over to
apologize for my behavior.

343
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:02,153
I'd really like it if we
could be friends.

344
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:09,163
Well, I know that would
make Joey happy, so...

345
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,528
I would like that too.

346
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,372
-Great.
-Now, come on.

347
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,508
-I'm glad we worked it out.
-Me too.

348
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,577
-I'll see you.
-Bye.

349
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,874
-Or I'll hear you.
-That's it, big girl!

350
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,716
Wait!

351
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,782
You'd better run!

352
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,589
Did you hear that?

353
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,058
-What am I gonna do?
-I'm sorry, man.

354
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,895
-Want to go watch?
-Yeah!

355
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,938
You know, I'm not sure
you could have taken Janine.

356
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,145
I could have taken her.

357
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,879
-She's much bigger than you.
-Are you kidding me?

358
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:07,719
I know what to do with tall girls.
You go for their knees.

359
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,663
-How you doing?
-So did she move out?

360
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,626
Pretty much.

361
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,062
I can't believe you just
broke up with her.

362
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,396
When it's not right, you know it.

363
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,833
-You okay?
-I'll be all right.

364
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,206
-You know what would cheer you up?
-What?

365
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:33,046
I'm giving this lecture on
erosion theories tomorrow night.

366
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,482
I think you should come.

367
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,521
You're right, that did cheer me up.
