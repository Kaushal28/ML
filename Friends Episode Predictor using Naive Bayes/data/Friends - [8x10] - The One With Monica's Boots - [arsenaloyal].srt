1
00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:07,625
-Hey.
-Hey. So, what do you think?

2
00:00:08,626 --> 00:00:12,171
New haircut? Necklace? Dress?

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,799
Boots? Boots!

4
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:20,888
Now, they're a little more than I usually
spend on boots. Or rent.

5
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,351
Did you say you bought "boots"
or "boats"?

6
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:27,478
I know.

7
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:33,151
-I'll miss being able to afford food.
-I'm sorry. They just looked so good.

8
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,027
The saleswoman was like:

9
00:00:35,278 --> 00:00:39,031
-"These are too expensive for you."
-She had a point.

10
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:42,827
-Hey.
-Hi. Oh, my God.

11
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:48,541
-Oh, Monica, those boots are amazing.
-They're mine!

12
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:55,131
-Too bad we're gonna have to return them.
-Return them? They're gonna hear you.

13
00:00:55,465 --> 00:00:59,427
I'm not returning them. I know they
cost a lot, but I'll wear them all the time.

14
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:03,723
You'll see. Besides,
I love the compliments.

15
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,768
Have you ever had something
so beautiful, everyone wants it?

16
00:01:06,976 --> 00:01:11,772
-I have you.
-Nice try. I'm keeping the boots.

17
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:52,396
That's right. I love you.

18
00:01:52,605 --> 00:01:56,776
And I'm gonna play with you
all the time.

19
00:01:56,984 --> 00:02:00,947
How can you let him talk
to your crotch like that?

20
00:02:03,115 --> 00:02:07,203
-He's talking to the baby.
-Oh! Okay.

21
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:12,416
Okay, because when he said,
"I can't wait for your first words"..

22
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,919
I thought, "There's a trick."

23
00:02:16,712 --> 00:02:19,924
Well, I gotta go, you guys.
I'll see you later.

24
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:22,218
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

25
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:28,808
Hey, listen. Can you do me a favor? My
sister knows you work at Ralph Lauren..

26
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:32,436
Forget it. No way. I am not sending
more Ralph Lauren clothes to prison.

27
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:34,814
-It is a waste.
-No, not her.

28
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:38,651
My youngest sister, Dina,
is interested in fashion.

29
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,154
She wants to talk to someone successful
to give her some advice.

30
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:46,242
-I guess I could talk to my supervisors.
-No, she wants to talk to you.

31
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:51,455
Really? Oh, my God. I'm successful.

32
00:02:51,664 --> 00:02:55,126
-Okay, so would you meet with her?
-Yes, I'd love to. Have her come by.

33
00:02:55,334 --> 00:03:00,298
Great, thanks. You'll love her. She's the
smartest of all the Tribbiani children.

34
00:03:00,506 --> 00:03:02,008
-Yeah, you know the SATs?
-Yeah.

35
00:03:02,174 --> 00:03:03,843
She took them.

36
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:09,640
-Doesn't Ben go to Smithfield Day School?
-Yeah. Why?

37
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:13,144
-Sting has a son that goes there too.
-I know. He's in Ben's class.

38
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:19,692
You knew and never said anything? With
all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?

39
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,573
Fine, no more dinosaur stuff.
Can I talk about fossils?

40
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:33,581
"Sting's son, 7 years old."
And there's a picture.

41
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:38,753
What are you reading, "The Kidnapper's
Guide to Manhattan Private Schools"?

42
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,340
It's New York Magazine. It's an article
about the city's best schools.

43
00:03:42,548 --> 00:03:46,594
-So how well do you know Sting?
-I actually haven't even met him.

44
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:51,724
Yeah. That's too bad. I really wanna go to
his concert Friday, but it's sold out.

45
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:55,936
I know! Why don't you
meet him and get tickets.

46
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:58,731
If you get two, I'll take you.

47
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,400
I'm picking Ben up tomorrow.
Maybe he'll be there.

48
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:06,364
There you go. You're so lucky.
You might get to meet Sting tomorrow.

49
00:04:06,572 --> 00:04:09,075
That's why you have kids.

50
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:17,291
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

51
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,920
Hi, Monica. Hi, boots.

52
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:26,258
See, Chandler? I'm getting a lot of use out
of them already. They're very practical.

53
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,387
You can wear them
with dresses, skirts, pants..

54
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:34,266
You wear them with shorts on the corner
and earn the money to pay for them.

55
00:04:35,226 --> 00:04:39,397
-Wow, they're beautiful.
-They hurt so much.

56
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:41,774
-What?
-The guy who made these..

57
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:45,111
hates feet
and wants to see them die.

58
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:49,490
Give them to me.
I haven't felt my feet in years.

59
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,286
I can't. I told Chandler I'd wear them
all the time. I can't just give them away.

60
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:57,790
-Then get your money back and return them.
-I can't do that either.

61
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:03,129
The soles are scuffed up, and the
insides are filled with my blood.

62
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:09,260
-Hey.
-Hey, I just picked up Ben from school.

63
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,972
I don't think you did
a very thorough job.

64
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,391
I dropped him off at Carol's.

65
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:18,436
Anyway, it turns out I'm not gonna
get those tickets, though.

66
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:19,937
Oh, no. Why not?

67
00:05:20,146 --> 00:05:23,983
It turns out Ben and Sting's son
do not get along.

68
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:27,153
-How come?
-Apparently, Sting's son made fun..

69
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:30,698
of the fact that Ben's moms
are "lesbenims."

70
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:36,454
Wait. If they don't get along, smooth
things over. Make them be friends.

71
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:39,749
-You can't force kids to be friends.
-Sure you can.

72
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:42,626
Give them some blocks.
Put them in a playpen.

73
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:46,380
-Playpen? Ben's 7.
-Your kid is 7?

74
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:50,509
He's really small.

75
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:55,931
-Please get the tickets.
-I'm sorry. I just can't do it.

76
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,935
-Yes, you can. Sting says so himself.
-What?

77
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:06,692
Look, I'm sorry..

78
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:13,574
Phoebe?

79
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:27,505
Here she is: future fashion superstar.

80
00:06:27,713 --> 00:06:31,675
-Oh, Joey, I'm hardly..
-My little sister Dina.

81
00:06:31,884 --> 00:06:33,969
-Hi, Dina. Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

82
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:37,473
Thanks so much for meeting with me.
Joey's told me so much about you.

83
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,933
This is so exciting for her.

84
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,394
-Ralph Lauren smiled at her in the elevator.
-You sure it was at you?

85
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,981
Because he likes it sometimes
when the buttons light up.

86
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:51,654
Well, I'll let you two "fashists"
get down to business.

87
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:56,826
You, be good, learn a lot. And if she takes
you to the freebie room, I need shirts..

88
00:06:56,992 --> 00:07:01,956
but none with that creepy logo with
the guy riding the dog, holding the bone.

89
00:07:02,414 --> 00:07:04,583
Okay. All right, Dina.

90
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:08,587
Well, let's talk about the different
areas of fashion..

91
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,923
that you could get involved in.

92
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:15,511
Let's see, there's design. But you may
need a whole other degree for that.

93
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:19,723
-Sales is great. You get to travel.
-I don't care about fashion.

94
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:24,436
I'm pregnant. And I know you are too,
so you gotta help me.

95
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:28,399
Then there's marketing.

96
00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:55,301
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. I just was yawning.

97
00:07:56,427 --> 00:08:00,222
-Don't forget, my office party's tonight.
-That's tonight?

98
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:04,685
I forgot all about the "secret Santa" gift.

99
00:08:05,394 --> 00:08:07,187
Do we like this?

100
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:09,940
We don't really have to go to this thing,
do we?

101
00:08:10,107 --> 00:08:16,155
I know that you don't like my office parties,
but you can wear your new boots.

102
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:20,034
See? Every cloud has
a supple leather lining.

103
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:24,914
-I don't wanna wear the boots tonight.
-Why not?

104
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:29,418
I'm worried your bosses will see them
and think they pay you too much money.

105
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:33,213
Or your assistant will see them
and want a raise.

106
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:37,468
Do you think I work some kind of
boot-pricing company?

107
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:41,263
I picked out this outfit I wanna wear,
and the boots don't go with it.

108
00:08:41,472 --> 00:08:46,435
You said those boots go with skirts,
dresses and pants.

109
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:50,064
What are you planning on wearing,
a chicken suit?

110
00:08:50,814 --> 00:08:53,400
Fine. If you want me to,
I'll wear the boots.

111
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:57,988
In fact, I'll go into my room right now
and try the outfit on.

112
00:09:02,952 --> 00:09:05,496
Christmas party in my boots!

113
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,545
I can't go in there. I can't tell him.

114
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:18,050
It's gonna be okay.
He has been incredibly supportive of me.

115
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:22,554
And if he gets a little upset,
that's what the meatball sub is for.

116
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:25,015
-Thank you.
-Okay.

117
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:29,853
Hey! It's my fashion girls.

118
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:34,608
-What's wrong?
-Why don't you sit down.

119
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:38,570
Dina has something
that she wants to tell you.

120
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:43,158
What's going on?
Is it Mom? Is she sick?

121
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:45,286
Is it Dad's heart?

122
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,913
Is that a sandwich?

123
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:53,544
-Mom and Dad are fine.
-Is that a sandwich?!

124
00:09:55,045 --> 00:10:00,801
Joey, there's something
that you should know. Dina?

125
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:05,472
-I'm pregnant.
-What?

126
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:07,891
Now. Give him the sandwich!

127
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:12,604
Obviously, this is a mistake.
You can't be pregnant.

128
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:15,941
Because you have to have sex
to get pregnant.

129
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,445
Joe, I tried to wait until
I was 25, like you did.

130
00:10:21,113 --> 00:10:22,573
What? Dina..

131
00:10:26,118 --> 00:10:32,082
I can't believe this. You're the good one.
You went to college! Both years!

132
00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:36,128
Who did this to you?

133
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:40,716
Bobby Corso. But he's a real nice guy.
I like him a lot. He's real funny.

134
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:47,389
You got pregnant for "funny"?
Dina, if he's funny, laugh!

135
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,479
-I'll be back. Stay here!
-Why? Where you going?

136
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:57,024
I can't look at you right now.

137
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:02,488
I know.

138
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:17,753
Oh, there you are, Ben.

139
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:20,714
You're Ben, right?

140
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:23,467
Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?

141
00:11:23,634 --> 00:11:26,178
I heard you're having a problem
with one of the boys.

142
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:31,850
So I thought I'd come and sit you both down,
have a little talk and make it all okay.

143
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:36,188
Now, the boy's name is Sting's son.

144
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:39,608
Jack? I hate him. He's a jerk.

145
00:11:39,817 --> 00:11:43,862
Sometimes people may seem
like jerks on the outside..

146
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:46,698
but they have famous fathers.

147
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:50,327
I have to go. My friend Doug
is waiting for me over there.

148
00:11:50,494 --> 00:11:53,080
Wow, your friend Doug
looks a lot like Billy Joel.

149
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:57,543
-Is that who his father is?
-No. His dad's a dentist.

150
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,253
Him, you're friends with.

151
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:11,473
-Excuse me, can I help you with something?
-Yes. I'm looking for Jack's parents.

152
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:14,434
-Are you with one of the students?
-I'm with Ben.

153
00:12:14,726 --> 00:12:19,857
-Are you one of Ben's mothers?
-I am one of Ben's mothers.

154
00:12:20,065 --> 00:12:22,401
I'm a lesbian.

155
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:26,405
It was difficult coming out
to my parents.

156
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:30,617
Well, hi. I'm Jenny Boon.
I'm a new teacher here.

157
00:12:30,868 --> 00:12:35,664
-I've only met your partner, Carol.
-That would make me Susan.

158
00:12:35,914 --> 00:12:41,879
Right. Are you looking for Jack's parents
to discuss his problems with Ben?

159
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:45,757
I think the parents should sit down together
and have a conversation.

160
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,886
Yeah, let's do that!

161
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,013
That sounds good.

162
00:12:51,263 --> 00:12:55,934
We should sit down and talk.
Me, my lover, Carol, and the Stings.

163
00:12:56,143 --> 00:13:01,440
-How will I get in touch with them?
-Their number's on the contact sheet.

164
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:06,612
Could I get a copy of that?
Carol threw it out. She lost ours.

165
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,950
She's such a scatterbrain.
But, man, what a hot piece of ass.

166
00:13:17,915 --> 00:13:22,336
-You know, that party wasn't bad.
-Yeah. I didn't know there'd be dancing.

167
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,546
That was a fun surprise.

168
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:28,634
-I don't see a cab. Maybe we should walk.
-No, we can't walk.

169
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,678
No. Hey, there's a cab.

170
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:33,889
That's a police car.

171
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:36,975
Maybe we could commit a crime,
have them pick us up.

172
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:40,395
-It's 15 blocks to the subway. Come on.
-Okay.

173
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:45,817
Do you think we can get to the subway
if we climb through that manhole?

174
00:13:46,068 --> 00:13:49,196
-What's going on?
-I can't walk, okay?

175
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:52,407
-These boots were a huge mistake.
-What?

176
00:13:52,658 --> 00:13:57,704
You were right. I never should have bought
them. They're killing me, one toe at a time.

177
00:13:58,163 --> 00:14:02,000
-So they're really tight, huh?
-I just said you were right, sweetie.

178
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,795
Isn't it clear I'm delirious from the pain?

179
00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:09,091
So I was right. This is what
it feels like to be right.

180
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:13,053
It's oddly unsettling.

181
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:15,847
How are we gonna we get home?
Maybe a piggyback ride?

182
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:19,059
I don't think me getting on your back
is gonna improve matters.

183
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:22,896
Wow, being right sure doesn't help
with the funny.

184
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,690
-Hop on.
-Okay, wait.

185
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,901
Let me just get my boots off first.

186
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:35,367
Oh, God.

187
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:44,543
I know you're in pain right now,
but I'm a little turned-on.

188
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:53,677
Do you ever worry that you'll be walking
and your baby will just slip out?

189
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:58,890
What college was that, Dina?

190
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:02,561
Oh, my God. Bobby?

191
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:06,606
Hi, Dina. Good to see you.

192
00:15:06,857 --> 00:15:10,986
-Joey, what are you doing?
-Just what needs to be done.

193
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:15,907
-Dearly beloved, we're gathered here..
-This is crazy.

194
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:19,411
Don't interrupt me
when I'm talking to God!

195
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,206
-Where were we? Do you take this man..?
-No!

196
00:15:23,415 --> 00:15:25,417
-You'll take him.
-No, I won't!

197
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:27,502
-You don't get a say.
-Yes, I do.

198
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:33,091
-I heard "I do." We're halfway there. You.
-All right, Joey, that is enough!

199
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,720
As beautiful and moving
as this ceremony is, this is not legal.

200
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:43,310
They don't have a marriage license or
witnesses, and the groom only has one shoe.

201
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,606
Yeah, he took the other one off
and hit me with it.

202
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,066
What am I supposed to do?

203
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:53,278
You're supposed to realize they are adults
and that can make their own decisions.

204
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:57,908
No, they can't. They were
stupid enough to get knocked up!

205
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:02,829
Contraceptives are not
always effective. Right?

206
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:09,795
-Yeah. We kind of didn't use any.
-Come on, kids, a little help here!

207
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:17,552
Wow! This place is incredible!

208
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:22,099
Sting's pen..

209
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:25,435
that he gave to Phoebe.

210
00:16:29,773 --> 00:16:33,777
Come on, secret passageway.

211
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,698
-Hi.
-Hi.

212
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:40,826
I'm Trudie. You must be Ben's mum.

213
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:45,330
-Why else would I be here?
-Why don't you sit down.

214
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:49,042
I gather Jack and Ben
haven't been getting along lately.

215
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,336
I'm sure there are two sides to this story.

216
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:55,173
But all I've heard is that
Ben's a bit of a "poo-poo-head."

217
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:59,720
-I'm sorry, won't Jack's father be joining us?
-No.

218
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:04,683
I see. You see, I think it would be better
for the children..

219
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:10,564
if all the parents were here. Except for,
you know, Ben's birth mother and father.

220
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,192
Well, I'm sorry.
Jack's father's not available.

221
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:19,448
Okay. Well, then, could we reschedule
for Friday night, perhaps at 8:00?

222
00:17:19,614 --> 00:17:22,242
No, I know that wouldn't work.
My husband's in concert.

223
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:28,331
Concert. Yeah.
That does put us in quite a pickle.

224
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:33,378
I'm busy before and after the concert,
and he's obviously busy during.

225
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:37,591
So I guess you and I should talk
about Jack and Ben right now.

226
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,302
Unless.. Unless..

227
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,473
Okay, I would be willing
to go to the concert..

228
00:17:44,681 --> 00:17:47,767
all the while thinking
about the children.

229
00:17:47,976 --> 00:17:52,564
-Are you here for tickets?
-Thank you. Four would be great.

230
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:58,111
I'm not giving concert tickets to someone
who'd use their son like this.

231
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,615
Then you're in luck. Ben's not my son.

232
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:04,910
Look, I've just pressed a button
triggering a silent alarm.

233
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:09,539
-Any minute now, the police will be here.
-The Police? Here?

234
00:18:09,748 --> 00:18:11,917
A reunion?

235
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:23,220
Okay, 10 blocks down. Five to go.

236
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:28,600
-Oh, wait! Stop, stop!
-Oh, I'm sorry. Do you need a break?

237
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:32,687
My boots in tan! Can you get a little closer
so I see the price?

238
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:37,400
I can see it from right here.
It'll cost you one husband.

239
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:42,572
I'm sorry. I can walk the rest
of the way now. Just give me my boots.

240
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:46,785
-I don't have your boots.
-I don't have them either. Where are they?

241
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:52,165
Why don't you check in one of my
saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay?

242
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:56,753
Okay. My God, we gotta go back
and get them!

243
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,964
Are you ever gonna wear the boots again?

244
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:03,510
Yes, I am. Okay? They're very practical.

245
00:19:04,261 --> 00:19:07,597
-I could wear them with pants or skirts..
-Honey. Honey.

246
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:14,646
Okay, I'll never wear them again. I just
didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

247
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:17,566
You know what? You can say goodbye
to the tan ones.

248
00:19:17,816 --> 00:19:22,487
-Okay. All right.
-Okay.

249
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:25,991
Bye, boots. Wait! Half off!

250
00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:33,873
Just because they're not getting
married doesn't mean it's a disaster.

251
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,004
-Maybe they have a plan.
-Oh, okay, let's hear their plan.

252
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,965
Now, what's the future look like
for Dina and Bobby?

253
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:43,466
Well..

254
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,304
I really have high hopes for my band.

255
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:52,559
-You were right. He is funny.
-Now, wait a minute.

256
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:56,855
I bet when you told people you wanted
to be an actor, they laughed at you.

257
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,608
Come on, Bobby,
tell us a little bit about your band.

258
00:19:59,858 --> 00:20:05,530
Well, it's just me and my pal Rooster.
The band's name is Numbnuts.

259
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:09,701
Really?

260
00:20:11,328 --> 00:20:14,581
If you're having a baby,
you should be married.

261
00:20:14,831 --> 00:20:19,920
Even if it is to Bobby.
Dude, that's not a compliment.

262
00:20:20,211 --> 00:20:23,798
-I knew you wouldn't be supportive.
-So, what are you gonna do?

263
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:27,928
Have the baby and raise it by yourself?
Without a husband?

264
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:31,890
You can't be a single mother alone!
You're gonna ruin your life!

265
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:36,937
-Excuse me. Am I ruining my life?
-No, it's different for you.

266
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:41,066
You're so strong. You're not some dumb kid
who doesn't know what she's doing.

267
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:45,987
-Excuse me?
-One pregnant woman at a time, please!

268
00:20:47,364 --> 00:20:49,783
I just want you to be okay.

269
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,494
So forcing her to marry Bobby
is gonna make that happen?

270
00:20:52,744 --> 00:20:54,788
Maybe.

271
00:20:56,373 --> 00:21:00,752
Yeah. So, what kind of music
does Numbnuts..?

272
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,380
Oh, forget it! I can't!

273
00:21:03,588 --> 00:21:09,386
I am scared to death about this. But I
think I can do it. I just need some help.

274
00:21:09,594 --> 00:21:13,431
-Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.
-You bet I am.

275
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,603
And to answer your earlier question,
we're straight-up gangster rap.

276
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:26,111
Look, Rachel's told me how much easier
you've made all this on her.

277
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:32,200
-Why can't you do that for me?
-Because you're my baby sister!

278
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:37,414
And you're my big brother. You're
my favorite guy in the whole world.

279
00:21:37,622 --> 00:21:43,128
I'm not even scared to tell Mom and Dad.
I was scared of telling you.

280
00:21:43,837 --> 00:21:46,798
I'd be scared of them, but all right.

281
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:51,678
I can't stand the thought of having
this baby with you mad at me.

282
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:54,639
I want him to have his uncle.

283
00:21:54,931 --> 00:21:58,351
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?

284
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,356
Of course he's gonna have
his Uncle Joey.

285
00:22:04,232 --> 00:22:10,155
We'll be all right. Even if we're not
married, this baby will be so loved.

286
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:13,658
-And not just by us.
-That's right.

287
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,494
By his uncle too.

288
00:22:16,828 --> 00:22:19,456
And by you.

289
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:27,589
Bobby, why don't we come over here and
let them have a little moment, okay?

290
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:33,845
Come here.

291
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:37,766
No, seriously, what's wrong with you?

292
00:22:45,482 --> 00:22:46,900
Guess what.

293
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:54,491
We're good. We're good.
We know each other.

294
00:22:55,992 --> 00:22:57,202
So..

295
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,164
-anyway, guess what.
-Oh, there's more?

296
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:05,251
You're gonna love me so much.
I got Sting tickets!

297
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:09,130
Oh, my God, I do love you!
How did you do it?

298
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,132
Well, let's just say:

299
00:23:16,221 --> 00:23:18,556
-Where are the seats?
-Middle balcony.

300
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:21,142
Would you say that's
more than 50 yards away..

301
00:23:21,392 --> 00:23:25,063
from Sting, his wife
or a member of his family?

302
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:28,608
-Yeah.
-Then that's not breaking the law. I'm there!
