1
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:06,101
I just saw Kathy naked.

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,136
It was like torture.

3
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:12,802
If we go to war and you're captured,
you're in for a surprise.

4
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,273
It keeps getting worse.

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,814
It bad enough that I'm in love
with my roommate's girlfriend.

6
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:23,955
Every time we're in the same room,
there's weird energy between us.

7
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,887
Call me crazy, but
I think she likes me too.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,357
And now I have seen her naked.

9
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,224
At least with her clothes on...

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,833
...I could imagine her body
was covered in boils.

11
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,503
But there are no boils.
She's smooth.

12
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,041
Smooth!

13
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:51,715
-Could everyone see up his robe?
-Oh, my God!

14
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,086
The One Where
Chandler Crosses the Line

15
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,698
-Here you go.
-I'll call you.

16
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:43,994
Great!

17
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,636
Hey, hey. Who was that?

18
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,137
Casey. We're going out tonight.

19
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,937
Going out? Wow!

20
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,478
It didn't work out
with Kathy? Bummer.

21
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,016
No, things are fine.

22
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:04,713
I'm having a late meal with her
after an early one with Casey.

23
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,247
-What?
-Yeah.

24
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:10,351
The craziest thing is,
I just ate a whole pizza myself.

25
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,256
You're going out with Kathy!

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,163
Yeah. Why are you upset?

27
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,802
Well, I'm upset...

28
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,128
...for you.

29
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:24,734
Sex with an endless line of beautiful
women must be unfulfilling.

30
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:30,575
What's the big deal?
It's not like we're exclusive.

31
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,216
Look, Joey.

32
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,788
Kathy's clearly not fulfilling
your emotional needs.

33
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,215
But, Casey....

34
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,290
Granted, I just saw
the back of her head.

35
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,126
But I got this sense
that she's smart and funny...

36
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,592
...and gets you.

37
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:50,466
You got all that
from the back of her head?

38
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,729
I think it's time
for you to settle down.

39
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,736
Make a choice.
Pick a lane.

40
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,264
Who's Elaine?

41
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,739
Little Tony Tarzan

42
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:07,476
Swinging on a nose hair
Swinging with the greatest of ease

43
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,354
I don't know the next verse.

44
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,224
You could just go:

45
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,985
Greatest of ease

46
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,956
Then go right into it.

47
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,492
I like that.

48
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,471
How do you know about...?

49
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,207
You know, I used to play.

50
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,401
That's right.
The keyboards?

51
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:36,308
A little in high school.
I got into it in college.

52
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,746
That's when
I really found my sound.

53
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:46,048
Orange juice just came out
of my nose, but it was worth it.

54
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,661
Oh, my God!

55
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,523
I completely forgot about
your sound.

56
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,693
He'd lock himself in
the basement for hours.

57
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:59,766
No one was ever allowed to hear
the sound.

58
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,333
I want to hear the sound.

59
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:07,370
No, I mean,
I haven't played in so long.

60
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,916
Well, it's really personal stuff.

61
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,381
Play that funky music, white boy.

62
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,351
-Yeah, come on.
-No, you guys.

63
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,423
My keyboards are all the way
Yeah, okay.

64
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,725
Who wants to get dinner later?
I wanna try that new ltalian restaurant.

65
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:32,361
Supposed to be really good. Saw a
lot of Chinese people eating in there.

66
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,070
What are you talking about?

67
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,734
You said some restaurant must be good
because Chinese people were eating there.

68
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,772
That's because it was
a Chinese restaurant.

69
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,848
I still wanna go.
Who wants to come?

70
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,887
Oh, I can't. I got two dinner dates
tonight, so I gotta get ready.

71
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,254
All right, girls' night out.

72
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,328
Sorry, but we have to prep that
catering thing for tomorrow.

73
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,862
Oh, that's right.

74
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,398
I wish I could eat
in restaurants alone.

75
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:04,002
You should try it.
It's a really good thing to do.

76
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:09,164
I just think I'd feel really self-conscious.
Like I was on display or something.

77
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,779
I was on display once.
Nothing like eating alone.

78
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,887
I just had a great time with myself.

79
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,623
Well, this could be a good story.

80
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,093
At dinner.
It was so liberating.

81
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:38,727
You know, I don't need people to
have fun. I'm fun. I'm a fun girl.

82
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:41,431
Are you a naughty girl?

83
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,006
No, just fun. Fun. Good. Fun.

84
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,137
-See, I told you you'd have fun.
-I know.

85
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,479
Although I must say that I totally
judge any woman I see eating alone.

86
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,086
-Why?
-What's wrong with a woman eating alone?

87
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:58,417
Well, obviously something.
She's eating alone.

88
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,314
Okay, guys.

89
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,155
All right! Bring it on, you!

90
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,063
Here we go.

91
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:19,042
You know, I've never played
my stuff for anyone before.

92
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,713
So it's important that
you understand...

93
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,348
...it's about communicating...

94
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,081
...very private emotions.

95
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:35,852
You know....

96
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:40,021
You should think of my work...

97
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,691
...as wordless sound poems.

98
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,040
-That's what
-Oh, my God, play.

99
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,510
Well, you know, that was...

100
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,274
...terrific!

101
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,350
Really...

102
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,454
...bitchen.

103
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,857
Wow! It was so wow!

104
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,287
Really?

105
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:48,400
Yeah! I mean, you should
play in public.

106
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,903
Wow, thanks, you guys.
That's

107
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,298
I want to play you another piece.

108
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:01,337
I left my helicopter sounds on
another disk. I'll be right back, okay?

109
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,013
This is so nice.
I mean, I am so....

110
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,489
God bless my dad for
soundproofing the basement.

111
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:20,531
I can't believe I ever let him
touch me with those fingers.

112
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,394
What are you guys talking about?
I loved it!

113
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,005
It was so moving.

114
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,700
It's so different
from the stuff you usually hear.

115
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,673
You mean, music?

116
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,248
I know what you think.

117
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:43,148
Yes, yes, your breasts
are just as firm and juicy.

118
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,786
Come in.

119
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,488
Oh, God! Is that Baywatch?

120
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:55,063
Yes, but I just watch it
for the articles.

121
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,660
-So is Joey around?
-No, he's not back yet.

122
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,237
Come in, have a seat.
Bow or stern?

123
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,501
I don't have a preference. You?

124
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,778
I like it in the stern.

125
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,039
Of the boat.

126
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,153
It's me. Casey and l
had a little car trouble.

127
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,154
-What happened?
-We broke down.

128
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,452
I have to get transmission fluid.

129
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,391
Tell Kathy that I'm sorry
and I'll be there soon.

130
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:31,126
-Why can't you tell her?
-I think my time is about to

131
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,508
I thought your time ran out.

132
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,146
Me too, but I guess I do have

133
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,808
Joey's running a little late,
and he says he's sorry.

134
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,352
I guess it's just you and me, then.

135
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,355
-Okay.
-Yeah, I think it is.

136
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,065
So, what'd you do today?

137
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,858
I had an appointment
to cut my hair.

138
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,935
-Looks great!
-And then it got canceled.

139
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,401
-I could cut it.
-Really? Do you do that?

140
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:14,409
Yeah, I learned at my aunt's
dog-grooming shop. What do you say?

141
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,045
Dog grooming?

142
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,941
Don't make my tail too poofy.

143
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,491
You have really great hair.

144
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,228
Oh, thanks. I grow it myself.

145
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,068
You know who also
has great hair is Joey.

146
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,261
Yes, Joey has great hair.

147
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:44,943
I'm basically done here.
Let me get this hair off your neck.

148
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,090
What are you doing?

149
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,824
Checking to see if it's even.

150
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,795
Looks good.

151
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,465
The phone!
The phone's making sounds!

152
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:17,802
Hey, dude, it's me.

153
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,999
Hey, it's Joey!

154
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,944
It looks like we'll be stuck here.

155
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,811
I got the fluid.
The transmission wasn't there.

156
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,181
-What?
-It fell out.

157
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,821
I just figured we hit a dog.

158
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:37,493
Could you put Kathy on?
I want to apologize to her.

159
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,628
It's Joey.

160
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,401
No, it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

161
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,595
Yeah, no, stop apologizing.
It's okay.

162
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,037
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

163
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,937
I should probably go.

164
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,959
I forgot my purse.

165
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,367
I really did.
I forgot my purse.

166
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,315
-This is bad! It's bad!
-Horrible!

167
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,513
Wait, the kiss or the situation?

168
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,612
The kiss was good.

169
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,555
-But that's bad!
-Here's what we do.

170
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,727
-We forget it happened.
-What?

171
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:46,955
We swallow our feelings, even if
we're unhappy forever. Sound good?

172
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,624
Can you really do that?

173
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,196
I have to. He's my best friend.

174
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,997
And you're seeing him.

175
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,202
Chandler, I like Joey a lot.

176
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,210
-But with you
-No, don't! Don't, see?

177
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,313
You're getting me confused.
I'm starting to yearn.

178
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,112
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:14,549
If you want to pretend that
nothing happened, I can try.

180
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,020
I think we have to.

181
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,012
Are you still out there?

182
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,659
Electrifying

183
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:57,258
Infinite time

184
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,833
There's a Starbucks
about three blocks down.

185
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:05,036
He's so inspired.
Just look at him. Look at him go!

186
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:24,028
Thank you very much!

187
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,421
Hey, aren't you up next?

188
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:31,065
-I'm not playing tonight.
-Why not?

189
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,264
I can't follow Ross.

190
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,341
It'd be like those
poor bicycle-riding chimps...

191
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,876
...who had to
follow the Beatles. No.

192
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,942
Ross sucks.

193
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,617
The place has emptied because of him.

194
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,755
Oh, my God, he's not even
appreciated in his own time.

195
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:58,160
I'd give anything to not be
appreciated in my own time!

196
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,667
You suck too.

197
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,070
You're awful.

198
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,744
You guys!

199
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,648
You suck too!

200
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:30,653
Man! I can't believe
I locked myself out again!

201
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,960
Hang on, buddy.

202
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,195
Oh, my God! What happened?

203
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,304
-Did you do all this? Why?
-I sure did.

204
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,171
It made me feel good to do
something nice for my friend.

205
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,777
You're amazing.

206
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,340
No, this is amazing.

207
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,912
A TV that appears
as if from nowhere!

208
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,717
That's the dream!

209
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,620
How did you afford all this?

210
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,887
I'm 29. I mean, who needs
a savings account?

211
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,822
You're the best friend
anyone has ever had.

212
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,693
I don't know.

213
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,165
No, you are.

214
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,737
You do this, you give me advice....

215
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,842
What you said about
focusing on one woman?

216
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,170
I'll do that.

217
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:21,603
With Casey?

218
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,181
I'll see how things go with Kathy.
She's cool.

219
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,849
-Or Casey.
-No, Kathy.

220
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,248
-Could be Casey.
-No, Kathy.

221
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,423
Consider Casey.

222
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:36,683
I think somebody's
got a little crush on Casey.

223
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,692
I'll fix you two up.
What do you think?

224
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:44,265
That all the pieces of my life
are falling right into place.

225
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:57,580
You were really great.
You were really, really great.

226
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,045
Thanks.

227
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:04,815
Monica tells me you don't want
to play anymore because of me...

228
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,185
...and, you know, my talent.

229
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,516
Is that true?

230
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,391
Well, kind of, yeah.

231
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:17,396
I was trying to be really okay
and upbeat about it...

232
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:21,164
...but I just feel so dwarfed
by your musical gift.

233
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,331
See, but....

234
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:29,343
Pheebs, that is the exact
opposite intent of my music.

235
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,744
You know, my music
is meant to inspire.

236
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,918
If it bothers you this much...

237
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,782
...then I won't play anymore.

238
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,686
No, don't do that.

239
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:48,092
How could I live if I knew I was
depriving the world of your music?

240
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,063
Yeah, okay.

241
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,211
-I'd love to, but I have plans on Sunday.
-Well, maybe some other time.

242
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:06,443
-Sure. Just give me a call, I'm in the book.
-Okay. Thanks a lot. See you.

243
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,980
What are you doing?
He is cute, and he's a doctor.

244
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:18,056
-How do you know?
-Honey, I eavesdrop because I care.

245
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,596
-Well, I have plans on Sunday.
-With who?

246
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,361
-Me.
-Oh, God.

247
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,994
You are the one who told me how
important it is to spend time alone.

248
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,109
I can't just go out with that guy
when I have plans with myself.

249
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,336
Wouldn't be fair to me.

250
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:37,646
So basically you're saying you
don't want to cheat on yourself.

251
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,150
Well, if you wanna make
me sound crazy.

252
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,146
Saw the new furniture. Very nice.

253
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,485
Joey has the best boyfriend ever!

254
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,456
I kissed Kathy.

255
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,028
Are you serious?

256
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,130
-Does Joey know?
-No.

257
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:59,100
Is there any way you think
he will understand this?

258
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,433
You obviously haven't
screwed over your friends.

259
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,507
Which we all appreciate.

260
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:10,347
If you'd told him how you felt
before you kissed her...

261
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,117
...knowing Joey,
he'd have stepped aside.

262
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,319
Don't say that!
That's not true, is it?

263
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,115
Yeah, he loves you.

264
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,952
Then why didn't you
tell me to do that?

265
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,555
I said something to Phoebe.

266
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,458
And I thought it was
a really good idea.

267
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,692
-Yeah, I remember.
-Oh, my God!

268
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,031
What am I going to do?

269
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:36,741
-You'll have to tell him.
-Why do I have to tell him?

270
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,667
-Because you do.
-Yeah, I know.

271
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:47,045
Would it be okay
if I wrote a song about this?

272
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,952
I don't know if this is
working out. I think....

273
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:58,187
I think I wanna see other people.

274
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,231
Wow. Didn't see that coming.

275
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,335
It's not that I don't
enjoy this. I do.

276
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:08,462
I just wanna see
what else is out there.

277
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,299
Hey, Guy. What are you doing here?

278
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,742
I work across the street.

279
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:18,747
-lt turns out I'm gonna be free Sunday.
-I wish you had called me.

280
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,682
I just told them I'd work this weekend.

281
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,481
Okay, well, maybe next weekend.

282
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,556
-Definitely. I'll see you.
-Okay.

283
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:30,122
Yeah, you'll be talking to me never,
because you're a freak who eats alone.

284
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,004
Sambuca margarita?

285
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,196
It that a real thing?

286
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,570
Well, we only had sambuca,
so it is now.

287
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,571
Listen, Joe. I need to I need
to talk to you about something.

288
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:52,877
What's up?

289
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,753
It's about Kathy.

290
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,186
I like her.

291
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,856
I like her a lot, actually.

292
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,261
-You do?
-Yeah.

293
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,763
Your timing couldn't be better.

294
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,797
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

295
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,225
What?

296
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:16,868
-Yeah, she broke up with me.
-When?

297
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,303
Just now, after acting class.

298
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:23,275
I thought she was doing some scene,
so I let people watch.

299
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:28,743
Man, I am so sorry.
Are you okay?

300
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:33,287
I've been better, but I'm all right.
So you like her?

301
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,086
Yes, but I don't have to.

302
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,956
No, it's okay.

303
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,429
You know why?
Because you came to me first.

304
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:51,069
I thought that would be
the best thing to do.

305
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,840
You might have your work
cut out for you.

306
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,983
When I talked to her, I got
the feeling she's into some other guy.

307
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,987
See, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

308
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,991
I think I know who the other guy is.

309
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,456
Who?

310
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,630
It's me.

311
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,594
I'm the other guy.

312
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,529
What?

313
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:23,433
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I got to talking...

314
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:26,305
...and one thing led
to another, and....

315
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:29,012
And what?
Did you sleep with her?

316
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:33,150
-No, I just kissed her.
-What? That's even worse!

317
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,850
-How is that worse?
-It's the same!

318
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:41,390
There's nothing I could do.
I think I'm in love with her!

319
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:42,582
Who cares?

320
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,886
You went behind my back?
I'd never do that to you!

321
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,463
I have no excuses.
I was totally over the line.

322
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:54,503
You're so far past the line,
that you can't even see the line!

323
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,402
The line is a dot to you!

324
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:02,206
Yes, right! And I feel horrible.
You have to believe me.

325
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,074
Oh, my God. Is that
why you bought all this stuff?

326
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,879
You know what?

327
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,552
I will not watch your TV.

328
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,620
I won't listen to your stereo.

329
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:17,124
And there's a loaf in the new
bread maker I won't eat. Know why?

330
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:21,992
-Probably because
-It's all tainted with your betrayal!

331
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:28,333
This apartment is empty to me!
I'm not happy about you either.

332
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,913
And just so you know...

333
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,745
...I made that bread for you.

334
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,833
Oh, my God! He's lost it.
He's totally lost it.

335
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,265
What?

336
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,469
This cannot get any worse.

337
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,801
Rats in the basement
are hanging themselves.

338
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,450
Thank you. Thanks.

339
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,457
I lost it.

340
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,062
I won't play anymore.

341
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:29,357
Would you?
Can you finish my set?

342
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:31,702
After that? Yeah.

343
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,200
No, I mean, if I can help.

344
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,213
Yeah, like I could lose it.

345
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:46,906
What?

346
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,814
I played bad on purpose, guys.

347
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,521
Okay, you were trying to
play bad this whole time.

348
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:56,125
No. Just that last song.
