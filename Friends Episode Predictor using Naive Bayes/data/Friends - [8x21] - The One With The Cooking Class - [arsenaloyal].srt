1
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:05,415
-Hey. I got some bad news.
-What?

2
00:00:05,665 --> 00:00:10,920
That's no way to sell newspapers.
Try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"

3
00:00:11,254 --> 00:00:15,341
No. Monica's restaurant got a horrible
review in the Post.

4
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:21,931
I didn't want her to see it, so I ran
around and bought all the copies.

5
00:00:22,515 --> 00:00:25,810
Two, four, six, one million.
Yeah, you got them all.

6
00:00:26,686 --> 00:00:30,398
This is bad.
And I've had bad reviews.

7
00:00:30,648 --> 00:00:32,608
I remember my first good one:

8
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:35,862
"Everything else in Our Town
was terrible.

9
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:39,031
Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."

10
00:00:42,577 --> 00:00:45,371
Oh, my God!
Look at all the newspapers.

11
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:49,459
It must be a good review. Is it great?

12
00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:54,839
Oh, dear God.

13
00:00:55,047 --> 00:01:00,470
But the good news is, no one
in a two-block radius will ever know.

14
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:03,890
-And the rest of Manhattan?
-They all know.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,853
Oh, my God, this is horrible.
I'm so humiliated.

16
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:12,607
They say there's no such thing
as bad press.

17
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:18,237
You don't think that "the mahi-mahi
was awful-awful" is bad press?

18
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:22,200
I didn't write it.

19
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,245
-God, is he right? Am I awful?
-Oh, no!

20
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:28,080
Monica, listen to me.

21
00:01:28,247 --> 00:01:31,626
I'm not just saying this
because I'm your friend.

22
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:35,046
Your food is abysmal!

23
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:20,466
-Ross?
-What? What?

24
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:24,303
-I am freaking out!
-Are you?

25
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:26,973
My due date is in one week!

26
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:30,101
-What are you doing up?
-That is seven days.

27
00:02:30,268 --> 00:02:33,437
I had a lot of water.
Can we do this after..?

28
00:02:33,646 --> 00:02:35,398
No, no, no, no, Ross!

29
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:38,317
We don't have any big stuff we need.

30
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:41,821
We don't have a
changing table or a crib.

31
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:46,826
-We do not have a diaper service.
-Funny you should mention diapers.

32
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:51,205
-I'm serious.
-There's nothing to worry about.

33
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:55,418
There's a baby store on West 10th.
We'll go there..

34
00:02:55,585 --> 00:03:00,214
-and get everything we need. Okay?
-Okay. Thank you. That's great.

35
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:03,467
Where on West 10th?
There's a shoe store..

36
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,306
Okay. If you're gonna do this,
then I'm gonna go do that, so..

37
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:12,184
-Wait, Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing.
-Yeah.

38
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:16,439
Our situation, you know,
what we mean to each other..

39
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:22,153
and, I mean, we're having this baby
together and we live together..

40
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,740
Isn't that..? Isn't that weird?

41
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:32,413
Well..

42
00:03:32,663 --> 00:03:35,416
I'm just kidding. You can go pee.

43
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:43,507
Did we say we were gonna meet here
or at the movie?

44
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:47,136
-We said at the movies, but..
-I'll see you there.

45
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:52,099
-Now that you're here..?
-I'll hang out till I have to meet you.

46
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:56,145
-How come you're not going?
-I've got a job interview.

47
00:03:56,354 --> 00:04:01,359
-I thought you already have a job.
-And they say you don't pay attention.

48
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:05,404
It's a better job.
It's vice president of the company..

49
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:09,492
that does data reconfiguration
for other companies.

50
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:15,748
-Wow. How do you know how to do that?
-That's what I do now.

51
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,210
-Joey? Come taste this.
-What?

52
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:22,880
Remember the guy that gave me
a bad review? Well..

53
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:26,050
I'm getting my revenge.

54
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:28,511
You cooked him?

55
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:32,556
No. He teaches a course
at The New School..

56
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:36,102
I want to make him try
my bouillabaisse again.

57
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,563
I can't wait to read the front
page tomorrow:

58
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,485
"Restaurant reviewer admits:
'I was wrong about Monica.'"

59
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:46,737
The front page?

60
00:04:46,904 --> 00:04:50,700
You really do live in your own
little world, don't you?

61
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:55,287
-I better get to my movie.
-Oh, yeah.

62
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:58,374
If I'm going to the movie
and you're going to the movie..

63
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,668
why don't we just go together?

64
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:04,130
How's that for data reconfiguration,
huh, Chand?

65
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:13,931
My name's Katie if there's
anything else you need.

66
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:17,852
Oh, God, I don't know. I want.. Everything
is so great, I just want everything.

67
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:20,896
Oh, look at this. We need this!

68
00:05:21,063 --> 00:05:22,815
-What is it?
-I don't know.

69
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:27,486
Have you ever had two people
who weren't wearing crowns..

70
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,030
spend this much money here?

71
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,824
You have selected a lot of nice things.

72
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,161
You want these delivered,
Mr. and Mrs. Geller?

73
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:37,371
-Oh, no, no.
-No, no.

74
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:40,458
-We're not married.
-We are having a baby..

75
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,710
but we're not involved.

76
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:47,173
I mean, we were seeing
each other a while ago..

77
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:52,595
but then we were just friends, and
then there was one drunken night..

78
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:58,684
Or, yes, stranger,
we'd like this delivered, please.

79
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:02,062
-Can you fill out this address card?
-Oh, okay.

80
00:06:02,688 --> 00:06:05,608
-You picked out a lot of dinosaurs.
-Yeah.

81
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:09,528
That's one of the reasons
why we're not a couple.

82
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:12,364
I chose those. I'm a paleontologist.

83
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,909
Really? That is so cool.

84
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:20,790
Don't get too worked up. It sounds
like he's a doctor, but he's not.

85
00:06:20,956 --> 00:06:23,459
No. I'm fascinated by paleontology.

86
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:27,755
-Have you read the Walter Alvarez book?
-I teach it in class.

87
00:06:27,963 --> 00:06:33,385
Standing at a cash register, I'm
holding a credit card, and I'm bored.

88
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:38,349
I love your neighborhood.
There's a great gym around the corner.

89
00:06:38,516 --> 00:06:42,478
-That's my gym.
-I could tell you work out.

90
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:52,071
A paleontologist who works out.
You're like Indiana Jones.

91
00:06:55,866 --> 00:06:58,202
I am like Indiana Jones.

92
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:08,963
-Hi, Pheebs.
-Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?

93
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,757
Great! We got everything we needed.

94
00:07:11,924 --> 00:07:16,053
Oh, and Ross almost got
something that wasn't on the list.

95
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,389
A whore.

96
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,890
What?

97
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:25,187
We were paying, and this sales
woman just started flirting with him.

98
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:26,856
Can you believe that?

99
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:31,277
-Did she know you two weren't married?
-Yeah.

100
00:07:31,443 --> 00:07:36,740
Oh, my God. Well, the idea..
A woman flirting with a single man?

101
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:39,910
-We must alert the church elders.
-No.

102
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:44,540
You don't understand.
You didn't see how brazen she was.

103
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:48,085
-Sounds like you're jealous.
-No, I'm not.

104
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:52,339
I just think it's wrong.
I mean, here I am, about to pop..

105
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:56,927
and he's out picking up
some shopgirl at Sluts-R-Us?

106
00:07:58,095 --> 00:08:00,598
Is that a real place?

107
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:03,350
Are they hiring?

108
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:07,521
Hey, Phoebe. Fatty.

109
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:10,524
Why so fancy?

110
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,484
I got a job interview.

111
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:16,530
It's more money, and I'd be doing
data reconfiguration.

112
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:21,744
-I think I know someone who does that.
-Me. I do that.

113
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:24,580
So do I look okay?
I'm nervous.

114
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:26,790
Oh, yeah. You look great.

115
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:30,211
You know, just don't
get your hopes up.

116
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,255
-Why not?
-Well, the interview.

117
00:08:33,464 --> 00:08:34,882
-Yeah?
-You know.

118
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,385
You don't make a very good
first impression.

119
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:41,805
-What?
-Oh, you don't know.

120
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:46,936
-Are you serious?
-When I first met you, you were like:

121
00:08:47,102 --> 00:08:50,231
I was like:

122
00:08:52,942 --> 00:08:54,735
What is it that I do?

123
00:08:54,944 --> 00:08:58,697
It's just, like, you're trying too hard,
making jokes..

124
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:01,158
You come off a little needy.

125
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:03,786
Did you like me when we first met?

126
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:10,000
Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to you.
But I am gonna run away from you.

127
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:15,714
She's put on so much weight.

128
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,055
There he is.

129
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:25,516
That smug bastard.

130
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,227
Okay, class.
We'll see you next time.

131
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,022
There he is.

132
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:38,487
Hi. I'm Monica Geller,
chef at Allessandro's.

133
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:40,698
Still?

134
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:43,117
The things you said were unfair..

135
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:46,662
and I want you to try
my bouillabaisse again.

136
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:49,790
I don't see why I'd do
that to myself again.

137
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:52,960
Either eat it or be in it.

138
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:55,838
Spoon?

139
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:02,720
-What do you think?
-I'm torn..

140
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:07,683
between my integrity
and my desire to avoid a beating.

141
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:13,314
But I must be honest.
Your soup is abysmal.

142
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,903
Thattagirl! We should get out of here,
there's a new class coming in.

143
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:22,740
Welcome to Introduction to Cooking.

144
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:28,078
Can anyone tell me the difference
between hollandaise and bearnaise sauce?

145
00:10:29,288 --> 00:10:31,457
-I can.
-Okay, go ahead.

146
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:35,294
Well, they both have a egg yolk
and butter base.

147
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:40,299
But a bearnaise has shallots,
chervil, and most importantly, tarragon.

148
00:10:40,758 --> 00:10:43,218
Very good. What's your name?

149
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:47,431
-You go to the head of the class!
-Okay!

150
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:52,811
This stuff takes up a lot of room.

151
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,607
How serious are you about keeping
Ben in your life?

152
00:10:57,274 --> 00:11:00,611
My son? Pretty serious.

153
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,411
Hi, Katie.
What are you doing here?

154
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,414
The delivery went out
and they forgot this.

155
00:11:12,623 --> 00:11:18,253
It must have been obvious, since it
was the only thing left in your store.

156
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:24,510
Listen, to be honest, home deliveries
aren't really part of my job description.

157
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:31,725
Oh, I actually came here
to ask you out.

158
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:36,313
Oh. Wow.
Yeah, that sounds great.

159
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:42,945
I'm just gonna put this back in my
pocket and pretend that didn't happen.

160
00:11:43,112 --> 00:11:45,697
I'm free now.
You want to get coffee..?

161
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:49,618
-Sure.
-Horny bitch.

162
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:56,583
No, you're a horny bitch!
No, you're a horny bitch!

163
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,586
No, you're a horny bitch!

164
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:01,922
You guys have a good time.

165
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:05,801
I'm just gonna grab my coat.
And my whip.

166
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:10,556
You know, because of Indiana Jones.

167
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:16,019
Not because I'm into S & M.

168
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:19,106
I'm not into anything weird, you know?

169
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:21,442
Just normal sex.

170
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:27,406
So I'm gonna grab my coat.

171
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:37,332
So you had a good day, huh?
Big commission, picked up a daddy.

172
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:40,419
Are you okay with this?

173
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:44,173
Oh, yeah. Yeah, please.
You guys have fun.

174
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:45,674
-Okay.
-Yeah.

175
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:47,092
Nice to see you.

176
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:51,680
Oh, and it was great to see you too.
And you look fantastic.

177
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,934
-Although you missed a button.
-Oh, actually, I..

178
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:58,812
Oh, okay, I see
what you're doing there.

179
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:05,861
I can't even believe this.
I really come off that badly?

180
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:08,822
It's okay. You calm down
after a while..

181
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:12,367
and then people see
how wonderful you are.

182
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:16,288
Good. Because I'm sure this
interview will last weeks.

183
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:20,834
All right, don't freak out, okay?
I will help you.

184
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:24,713
-How long before you have to leave?
-An hour.

185
00:13:24,922 --> 00:13:27,466
-I can't help you.
-Phoebe..

186
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:33,138
We'll do our best. I'm the interviewer
and I'm meeting you for the first time.

187
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:37,434
-Okay.
-Hi. Come on in. I'm Regina Phalanges.

188
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,437
-Chandler Bing.
-Oh, Bing.

189
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:44,441
-What an unusual name.
-You should meet my Uncle Bada.

190
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:53,242
I'll let myself out.

191
00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:02,626
Your alfredo's dry.
Did you use your cheese?

192
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:08,006
When you say "use," do you mean
"eat as a pre-cooking snack"?

193
00:14:08,632 --> 00:14:11,885
-And the cream?
-Cheese makes me thirsty.

194
00:14:13,637 --> 00:14:17,266
-Okay. Let's move on.
-All right.

195
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:22,229
Something smells good
over at Monica's station.

196
00:14:23,272 --> 00:14:27,234
My God! This is amazing!
You've never made this before?

197
00:14:27,442 --> 00:14:31,154
Oh, no. I don't know anything
about cooking.

198
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:36,243
I had to ask what it was called when
the water makes those bubbles.

199
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:41,415
-Hats off to the chef.
-Your mouth was full. I didn't hear.

200
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:43,625
-Hats off to who?
-The chef!

201
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:46,169
That's right!

202
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:53,635
You'll find that I don't micromanage.
I don't shy away from delegating.

203
00:14:53,802 --> 00:14:58,473
That's good to know. But let's stop
focusing on what you don't do..

204
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,767
and focus on what you do do.

205
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:06,356
What I do do..

206
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:13,488
is create an atmosphere of support
for the people working with me.

207
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:16,366
Nice sidestep on the "do do" thing.

208
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:20,245
-Hardest thing I've ever done.
-Oh, you gotta go!

209
00:15:20,662 --> 00:15:23,165
-Don't worry. You're ready.
-Really?

210
00:15:23,415 --> 00:15:28,879
Absolutely! Just fight all your
natural instincts, and you'll be great.

211
00:15:30,088 --> 00:15:32,382
Monica, check these out.

212
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,260
Those look like cookies.

213
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:37,512
I know, yeah.
And I made them all by myself.

214
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,640
I mixed the ingredients,
I put them in the oven, I took them out.

215
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:44,227
Granted, I should have used
the oven mitts, but still.

216
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,813
Monica, my star student.

217
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,277
You called me that before,
so I fashioned a star out of foil.

218
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:56,823
Now, no pressure. If you like my
cookies, you give me the star.

219
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:03,872
Wow, a star!

220
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:08,877
I know you all hate me,
and I'm sorry, but I don't care.

221
00:16:09,294 --> 00:16:12,673
-Okay, Joey, you're up next.
-Yeah.

222
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:17,636
Oh, my God! This is amazing!

223
00:16:17,803 --> 00:16:19,721
You get an A.

224
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:24,601
I got an A? In school?
Hey, I'm a dork!

225
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:28,146
Joey, I'm so proud of you.

226
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:31,441
-I think you should give him your star.
-Excuse me?

227
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:37,114
-He doesn't know what he's doing.
-Nobody knows what they're doing.

228
00:16:37,322 --> 00:16:40,492
I do. I'm a professional chef!

229
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:43,745
Oh, relax. It's not a courtroom drama.

230
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:46,790
Why are you taking
Introduction to Cooking?

231
00:16:46,998 --> 00:16:48,708
Yeah!

232
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:54,005
I'm sorry. I cook at this restaurant,
Allessandro's..

233
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:56,341
and I just got a bad review.

234
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,428
-Allessandro's? I love that place!
-You do?

235
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:02,806
You're a great chef.
As a person you're a little..

236
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:06,852
-Oh, I'm crazy, but you liked the food?
-Very much.

237
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,440
Okay, then. I don't stink.
I'm a good chef! Okay.

238
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:14,067
I don't want to go. I'm having fun.

239
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,945
Did either of you pay for this class?

240
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:21,074
Hey, if my friend says
it's time to go, it's time to go!

241
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:34,337
I was the point person on my company's
transition from the KL5 to GR6 systems.

242
00:17:34,546 --> 00:17:38,925
-You must have had your hands full.
-That I did. That I did.

243
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:43,221
So let's talk a little bit
about your duties.

244
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,060
My duties?

245
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,523
All right.

246
00:17:53,732 --> 00:17:58,153
You'll be heading a whole division,
so you'll have a lot of duties.

247
00:18:01,072 --> 00:18:04,868
-I see.
-But there'll be 30 people under you..

248
00:18:05,035 --> 00:18:08,079
so you can dump
a certain amount on them.

249
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,253
-Good to know.
-We could go into detail..

250
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,422
No, don't, I beg of you.

251
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:21,510
All right. We'll have a definite
answer for you on Monday.

252
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:25,847
But I can say with some
confidence, you'll fit in well here.

253
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:29,142
-Really?
-Absolutely.

254
00:18:30,185 --> 00:18:33,271
-You can relax. You did great.
-Yeah, thanks.

255
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:37,400
I was really nervous.
I'm told I come on too strongly.

256
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:41,738
And then it was really hard
to sidestep that "duty" thing.

257
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:44,866
Duties?

258
00:18:45,534 --> 00:18:47,911
Doodies?

259
00:18:48,954 --> 00:18:50,956
Poo?

260
00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:54,459
Poo?

261
00:18:55,669 --> 00:19:00,090
Oh, my God. This doesn't count. Okay?
The interview was over.

262
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:04,094
That was the real Chandler Bing.
This is some crazy guy.

263
00:19:04,302 --> 00:19:08,265
Call security! There's a crazy guy
out in the hall!

264
00:19:08,974 --> 00:19:11,059
Poo?

265
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,563
I'll look forward to your call.

266
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:21,611
-Hey.
-Hey.

267
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,989
-You're back.
-How are you?

268
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:29,536
I'm fine. But that's not important.
What's important is how was she?

269
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:32,289
It was fun.
We just had coffee.

270
00:19:32,497 --> 00:19:37,127
Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee,
a little rub-rub-rub under the table?

271
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:40,964
What's going on?
Do you not like Katie?

272
00:19:41,172 --> 00:19:47,178
No. No, she was nice. I mean,
she was a little slutty, but who isn't?

273
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:48,597
Well, I liked her.

274
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:53,727
Of course you did. You'd date a gorilla
if it called you Indiana Jones.

275
00:19:54,853 --> 00:19:58,690
Did you get a fresh batch
of pregnancy hormones today?

276
00:19:58,857 --> 00:20:02,485
No. It's just that..
Katie bothered me.

277
00:20:02,694 --> 00:20:05,447
Why? What was wrong with her?

278
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:09,159
There was nothing wrong with her.
She was lovely.

279
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:13,413
-Okay. So, what's the matter?
-I don't want you to date her.

280
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:16,958
Why? What, are you jealous?

281
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:21,087
Yes. And not because
I want you to go out with me.

282
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:24,841
Because I don't want you
to go out with anybody.

283
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,928
It's terrible to even think this
and it's inappropriate..

284
00:20:29,137 --> 00:20:34,225
but I want you to be at my constant
beck and call, 24 hours a day.

285
00:20:34,517 --> 00:20:38,563
I'm very sorry, but that is
just the way that I feel.

286
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:44,027
-Okay.
-What?

287
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:48,323
I won't date. I'll..

288
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,368
I'll be here with you all the time.

289
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,246
Really?

290
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:59,250
But I'm being so unreasonable.

291
00:21:00,335 --> 00:21:05,757
True, but you're allowed to be
unreasonable. You're having our baby.

292
00:21:10,095 --> 00:21:14,224
Oh, Ross, thank you. Thank you.

293
00:21:17,018 --> 00:21:19,479
You feel better?

294
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:23,775
No, not really. You're pressing
the baby into my bladder..

295
00:21:23,984 --> 00:21:26,319
and now I have to pee.

296
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:27,737
-Okay.
-Rach?

297
00:21:27,904 --> 00:21:31,199
-Yeah?
-Just one thing..

298
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:37,956
We live together. You're having our
baby. I'm not gonna see anybody else.

299
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:42,085
Are you sure you don't want
something more?

300
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:48,591
Wow. I don't know, maybe..

301
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:52,387
Oh, Rach, I was just messing around.

302
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,892
-Like you did when I had to pee?
-Oh! I knew that.

303
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:01,271
I knew that!
I was just messing with you too!

304
00:22:03,648 --> 00:22:06,651
Okay. Because for a minute
you seemed..

305
00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:09,946
-No, it's just..
-Like you actually..

306
00:22:10,113 --> 00:22:13,033
That's just because I'm such
a good messer!

307
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:20,582
-Rach?
-Yeah?

308
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,293
-The bathroom?
-Right.

309
00:22:26,838 --> 00:22:29,966
I had a great time. I learned how to bake,
ate great food.

310
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:35,430
It's my first A since 7th grade and
I didn't even sleep with the teacher.

311
00:22:36,139 --> 00:22:39,059
-Oh, look. Acting for Beginners.
-Yeah.

312
00:22:39,434 --> 00:22:42,979
-Wanna feel good about yourself?
-What the hell!

313
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:45,648
Let's start with some basics.

314
00:22:45,857 --> 00:22:51,529
Can anybody tell me what the difference
between upstage and downstage is?

315
00:22:57,577 --> 00:23:00,455
Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
