1
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:04,766
Chandler, Mon, there's only one
banana-nut muffin left.

2
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:06,132
I ordered mine first.

3
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:08,432
Yeah, but I'm so much faster.

4
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:10,809
Give it to me.

5
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:12,108
No.

6
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:13,907
Give it to me!

7
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:16,477
Okay, you can have it.

8
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,517
There you go. Enjoy your coffee.

9
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:30,260
That was there when I got here.

10
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:35,959
Hey, you'll never guess
who's coming to New York.

11
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,829
Quick, tell us before he swallows.

12
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,968
Ryan, that guy I dated
who's in the Navy.

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,137
You went out with a guy in the Navy?

14
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:47,814
I met him while playing guitar
in the park.

15
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:51,348
Ryan threw in saltwater taffy
because he didn't have change.

16
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,646
Is that when you wrote
"Saltwater Taffy Man"?

17
00:00:56,557 --> 00:01:00,323
No, he's my submarine guy.
He resurfaces every couple years...

18
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:03,190
...and we have an amazing
three days together.

19
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:08,164
Only this time, he's coming for 2 weeks.
Two whole weeks, which means "yea"!

20
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:12,897
So this guy goes down
for, like, two years at a time?

21
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,671
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.

22
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,047
Hi.

23
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,647
Oh, no. What happened?

24
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:29,322
I just spoke to Carol.
Ben's got chickenpox.

25
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:30,512
Oh, no.

26
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:34,057
Yeah, so if you haven't had it,
chances are you'll get it.

27
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,990
-I've had it.
-I've had it.

28
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:37,186
-Had it.
-Had it.

29
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:40,731
I've never had it. I feel so left out.
Oh, look!

30
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,531
The One With the Chicken Pox

31
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:36,884
Honey, you made the bed again.

32
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:40,422
I told you, you don't have to do that.
This isn't camp.

33
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:44,723
Then I guess the panty raid last night
was totally uncalled for.

34
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:50,896
I'm taking a shower. Today I'll
sing Jim Croce's "Leroy Brown."

35
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,247
Hey, Mon, I have a question.

36
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:08,688
Is Leroy the baddest man
in the whole damn town...

37
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,881
...or the fattest man?

38
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:16,023
The baddest. Otherwise, the song
would be "Fat, Fat Leroy Brown."

39
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:17,787
What are you doing?

40
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:22,568
I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.

41
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,200
Are you remaking the bed?

42
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:31,070
I'm sorry. The way you did it,
it was just fine.

43
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,711
Then you're redoing it
because...?

44
00:03:33,982 --> 00:03:35,609
You'll think I'm crazy.

45
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,613
You're pretty much
running that risk either way.

46
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:42,046
Okay. You see...

47
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:45,960
...the duvet tag shouldn't be
at the top left corner...

48
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,720
...it should be at the
bottom right corner.

49
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:52,165
-That's not so crazy.
-I'm just easing you in.

50
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:53,933
All right.

51
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:56,896
You see these little flower blossoms?

52
00:03:57,105 --> 00:03:59,096
They should be facing up not down...

53
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,969
...because the head of the bed
is where the sun would be.

54
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:08,782
You don't love me anymore, do you?

55
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:14,113
Actually, if it's possible,
I love you more.

56
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:15,619
Really?

57
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,683
Wow. Well, then, come on!

58
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:23,259
I wanna show you how to fold
the toilet paper into a point.

59
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:29,636
If you need something
to hold you over...

60
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,804
...I can get you a job here
as an entry-level processor.

61
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,871
Don't you need experience like this?

62
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,440
It's not hard to learn.

63
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:40,442
As for people realizing you don't know
what you're doing, you're an actor.

64
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:44,209
Act like a processor,
people will think you're a processor.

65
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,885
Here's this morning's projections.

66
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,649
Thanks.
Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbiani.

67
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,753
Joey is a fellow processor.

68
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:55,554
No kidding?

69
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:03,301
I process. People want the processing,
I'm the one they call.

70
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:07,903
-Where do you work?
-Well, I'm in between things.

71
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:11,509
You know, one day you're processing,
the next day...

72
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:13,976
...you're not so much
processing anymore.

73
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:17,150
I told Joey about the opening
in Fleischman's group.

74
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:18,978
Fleischman's group.

75
00:05:19,187 --> 00:05:22,350
Whatever you do,
don't touch his sandwiches.

76
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:27,688
Are all you processors dorks?

77
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:36,328
This lipstick looks just great on you.

78
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:39,106
You look fabulous.
You really do.

79
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,932
Yeah, are you sure?
Really?

80
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:47,208
See, you look beautiful.
For God sakes, dim the lights.

81
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:50,973
I'm hideous!

82
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,550
It's gonna be okay.

83
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,344
Ryan's been underwater.

84
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:58,150
He's just gonna be glad you don't
have barnacles on your butt.

85
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:11,670
Come in.

86
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,664
Hey, baby, I'm back

87
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:16,810
Hey, Ryan. What's up?

88
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
What's going on?

89
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:23,680
No, no.
You have to stay back.

90
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:25,250
I have the pox!

91
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,920
Chicken or small?

92
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:33,925
Chicken, which is so ironic
considering I'm a vegetarian.

93
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:39,021
-Why aren't you home in bed?
-My grandmother's never had chickenpox.

94
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:43,836
Please tell me you have, because
oh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.

95
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:46,840
I'm sorry, I never had them.

96
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,846
If I had one wish,
I'd go back to when I was 7...

97
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,881
...when Jimmy Hauser had chickenpox,
and rub that kid all over my face.

98
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:01,211
Yeah, or you could wish
that I didn't have them now.

99
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,351
Can I please see your face?

100
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:06,390
No. You don't wanna see a face
covered with pox.

101
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,789
It could be lox, I wouldn't care.

102
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,856
And you hate fish.

103
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,630
So sweet. All right.

104
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:18,098
Okay, all right.
You can see.

105
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,871
This is me.

106
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:26,905
Sorry!

107
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:29,044
I am scary!

108
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,912
The lightening was
an unfortunate coincidence.

109
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:35,889
You look lovely!
Lovely!

110
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,250
I hate this.

111
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:40,885
I had the most amazing
two weeks planned for us.

112
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:44,587
And everything I had in mind,
we had to be a lot closer than this.

113
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,129
I've spent the last eight months
in a steel tube with men...

114
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,966
...thinking about this moment.

115
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,099
I am not gonna let a bunch...

116
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,575
...of itchy spots stand between us.

117
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:10,446
Okay. This is the most
romantic disease I've ever had.

118
00:08:17,198 --> 00:08:19,860
-How's the first day?
-Good. It's like you said.

119
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:23,002
It's putting numbers
from one column into another.

120
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,328
There you go.

121
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:29,100
And everybody's nice. I just had
a good talk with that lady Jeannie.

122
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,002
Jeannie? The head of
East Coast operations, Jeannie?

123
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:35,682
Turns out our kids go
to the same school.

124
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,717
Yeah. Small world, huh?

125
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:43,285
Weird world.

126
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:45,357
Your kids?

127
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:48,194
I figure my character has kids.

128
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,795
There isn't a part of that sentence
I don't need explained.

129
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:56,960
When you're acting, you need
to think about that stuff.

130
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:59,537
My character,
Joseph the processing guy...

131
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,837
... has two little girls,
Ashley and Brittany.

132
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,640
Ashley copies everything
Brittany does.

133
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:16,652
Well, invisible kids
can be that way sometimes.

134
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:22,552
You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen,
are thinking of having a third kid.

135
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,060
You know what?

136
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:25,991
Just did.

137
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:31,436
That's some pretty powerful
imaginary sperm you must have there.

138
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:45,616
You Know what makes the itching worse?

139
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,679
That you don't stop talking about it?

140
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,120
-Fine.
-Let's just play, okay?

141
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:53,655
Good, okay.

142
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,458
Here we go, double sixes.

143
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,687
Here we go....

144
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:00,988
Here we go....

145
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,328
Come to Mama.
Getting ready to roll the dice....

146
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,164
What are you doing?
Are you scratching?

147
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,206
No. This is what I do
for luck, okay?

148
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,676
You're scratching.

149
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,139
Give me the dice.

150
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:16,871
-Give me the dice.
-No! Here. There!

151
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,549
Look, double sixes!

152
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,382
We can't scratch. We'll scar.

153
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:26,485
I can't stop thinking about it.
It's just so hard.

154
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:30,024
I wanna grab these houses
and rub them all over my body.

155
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,854
-No!
-Give it!

156
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,361
Come on!

157
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,296
You know you want it.
You know you want it too.

158
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,993
Let's just be bad.
It'll feel so good.

159
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,672
Come on.

160
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,737
Oh, God, help me.

161
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,679
-Oh, yeah.
-Okay, good. Now do me.

162
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,713
Do my back.
Oh, come on. Harder!

163
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:51,848
There you go.

164
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:52,983
-Don't move.
-Why?

165
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,210
-Don't move.
-What are you...?

166
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,758
Stop that.
Stop that right now.

167
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:06,359
I might've expected this of Phoebe.
But, Ryan, you're a military man.

168
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,359
She make me doing.

169
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,959
-That's a nice color on you.
-You will become pink and blunch baby.

170
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:18,870
I hope you get a Winnie pork.

171
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,567
You and Milton have to join us
on the boat. Bring the kids.

172
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,273
We'll make a day of it.

173
00:11:28,508 --> 00:11:31,204
That sounds lovely.
We'll have to set it up.

174
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:34,107
I better get back.
Hope the baby feels better.

175
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:36,009
Thanks.

176
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,377
-Bye-bye, Jeannie.
-Bye-bye, Joseph.

177
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:40,577
What a phony.

178
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:47,049
You'll teach her a lesson when she
steps off the dock onto nothing.

179
00:11:48,695 --> 00:11:50,424
-Hey, Mr. Douglas.
-Sir.

180
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:55,034
Bing, I got your memo. We're not gonna
see the report until next Friday?

181
00:11:55,235 --> 00:11:57,863
My group wants to spend
the holiday with family.

182
00:11:58,105 --> 00:12:00,903
I have a family.
I'm gonna be here.

183
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:03,269
Yeah, Bing.
What's that about?

184
00:12:08,248 --> 00:12:11,274
It's about cutting them
a little slack for morale.

185
00:12:11,585 --> 00:12:14,383
Look, I can get some
rough numbers by Wednesday.

186
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:16,646
Rough numbers?

187
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:21,819
This company wasn't built
on rough numbers. Right, Mr. Douglas?

188
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:25,229
Have the final numbers
on my desk by Tuesday.

189
00:12:25,432 --> 00:12:27,127
If you say so, sir.

190
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:30,428
Joseph's good, isn't he?

191
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:34,167
I'm going to kill you.

192
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:39,678
Hey, I just figured Joseph's
the kind of guy who likes to mix it up.

193
00:12:39,913 --> 00:12:43,144
You know, get in there,
ruffle some feathers.

194
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:45,579
Why?

195
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:50,684
Look, I'm sorry,
but that's what Joseph does.

196
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,316
Okay? If you try to pull something...

197
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,421
... he'll call you on it.

198
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:58,420
"What are you trying to pull?"
he'll say.

199
00:13:03,837 --> 00:13:04,667
Duct tape.

200
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:07,139
Was I supposed to bring something too?

201
00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:12,476
This is for the scratchy twins.
I taped oven mitts to their hands.

202
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,147
You're strict.

203
00:13:15,349 --> 00:13:17,214
Well, it's for their own good.

204
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:21,979
You know, I like the way you have
efficiently folded this tab under.

205
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:26,555
See, in a tape emergency you could
shave valuable seconds off your time.

206
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:29,791
Exactly!

207
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:34,232
God, I love that I can be
totally neurotic around you now.

208
00:13:35,068 --> 00:13:36,057
Tell me the truth.

209
00:13:36,336 --> 00:13:39,533
Don't you like having everything
on your desk perpendicular?

210
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,903
If it's not a right angle,
it is a wrong angle.

211
00:13:43,844 --> 00:13:44,902
-Very good.
-Thank you.

212
00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:47,840
Tomorrow, I'm gonna do your clocks.

213
00:13:48,815 --> 00:13:50,680
You're gonna do what to my clocks?

214
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:52,349
Set them to my time.

215
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:55,979
I'm confused.

216
00:13:56,223 --> 00:13:58,487
I thought we shared time.

217
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:03,693
No. See, in my bedroom
I set my clock six minutes fast.

218
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:04,828
Wanna know why?

219
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:09,502
Because it's in a slightly different
time zone than the kitchen?

220
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,737
Forget it.

221
00:14:11,004 --> 00:14:12,266
No, come on, tell me.

222
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:14,336
-You don't understand.
-Come on.

223
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,566
You don't have any obsessive things.

224
00:14:16,777 --> 00:14:18,608
No, that's not true.

225
00:14:18,845 --> 00:14:20,938
Oh, yeah?
Tell me one of yours.

226
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:32,449
One of my things is
I always separate my sweat socks...

227
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:35,126
...from my dress socks.

228
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:39,589
What if they get mixed up?

229
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,734
Boy, I would just....

230
00:14:42,803 --> 00:14:44,100
I would freak out.

231
00:14:46,273 --> 00:14:47,740
You would not.

232
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:51,569
I can't believe this.
I hate this. You're too normal.

233
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:53,871
I can't believe you
don't have a "thing."

234
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:56,641
My boyfriend doesn't have a "thing."

235
00:14:56,883 --> 00:15:00,080
See, if anyone overheard that,
I didn't come off well.

236
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:14,130
-Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
-Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?

237
00:15:14,835 --> 00:15:18,396
He suspects you dropped the ball
on the Lender project.

238
00:15:19,272 --> 00:15:21,832
Why? Why does he suspect that?

239
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:25,241
At first, he thought it was Joseph...

240
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:29,006
...but after he asked Joseph about it,
turns out it was you.

241
00:15:31,084 --> 00:15:34,520
-Anyway, I thought you should know.
-All right. That's it.

242
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:36,016
Look, Joey...

243
00:15:36,256 --> 00:15:39,123
... I realize this is the role
of a lifetime for you...

244
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:43,490
...and if I could just fire Joseph,
I would. But that's not possible.

245
00:15:43,697 --> 00:15:45,426
So I have to let you both go.

246
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:49,526
What? Everybody loves Joseph.

247
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:51,760
I don't. I hate Joseph.

248
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,267
I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.

249
00:15:57,777 --> 00:16:01,042
You can't fire Joseph.
He's not in your department.

250
00:16:06,153 --> 00:16:09,452
All right, okay.
So I can't fire Joseph...

251
00:16:10,023 --> 00:16:11,718
... but I can sleep with his wife.

252
00:16:15,195 --> 00:16:16,059
Not Karen!

253
00:16:16,363 --> 00:16:19,662
Yeah, I'm thinking about
having an affair with her.

254
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:21,060
You know what?

255
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:22,732
I just did.

256
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,102
What the hell are you doing?

257
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:29,570
Oh, it's not me.

258
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:31,140
It's my character!

259
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:32,908
Chandie.

260
00:16:34,414 --> 00:16:37,713
The rogue processor who seduces
his coworkers' wives...

261
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:39,886
...and then laughs about it.

262
00:16:40,153 --> 00:16:43,589
In fact, I have her panties
right there in my drawer!

263
00:16:43,823 --> 00:16:46,314
-Really?
-No, freak show, she's fictional!

264
00:16:47,894 --> 00:16:48,986
Take it easy.

265
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:53,899
If it means that much to you,
I'll go find something else.

266
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:56,198
Thank you.

267
00:16:58,071 --> 00:17:01,529
It's just that
I'm gonna miss Joseph.

268
00:17:02,242 --> 00:17:04,437
I liked him. His wife.

269
00:17:04,744 --> 00:17:06,006
She was hot.

270
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:11,006
And the kids, you gonna put a pour like summer.

271
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:19,011
Please take these off.
I swear I won't scratch.

272
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,481
No, sorry, hon.
Monica's orders.

273
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,483
Well, that wasn't easy.

274
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:28,520
Okay, dinner's on.

275
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:31,761
There's a peach cobbler
warming in the oven.

276
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:36,096
So the plate's gonna be hot, but that
shouldn't be a problem for you.

277
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,670
All right, you kids.
Bye, now.

278
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:41,772
-Bye.
-Oh, look, look.

279
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:43,807
A low-budget puppet show.

280
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,040
A shame you can't see
what finger I'm holding up.

281
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:55,353
-Wine?
-Please.

282
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,832
-Spilled some.
-I got it.

283
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,514
You look beautiful tonight.

284
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,014
What?

285
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:25,984
Sorry.

286
00:18:29,223 --> 00:18:30,247
You look beautiful.

287
00:18:47,408 --> 00:18:49,740
You know what? That's it.
That's it.

288
00:18:57,785 --> 00:18:58,615
Oh, yes.

289
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:01,919
Good.

290
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:09,026
You guys, did you?

291
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:19,736
Monica...

292
00:19:19,974 --> 00:19:21,066
...wake up.

293
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:23,604
What's up?

294
00:19:23,811 --> 00:19:25,142
I thought of a thing.

295
00:19:29,517 --> 00:19:30,449
Yeah?

296
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,284
I have to sleep, have to,
on this side of the bed.

297
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:41,284
No. You have to sleep
on this side of the bed...

298
00:19:41,562 --> 00:19:44,463
... because I have to sleep
on this side of the bed.

299
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,062
Or so I would have you believe.

300
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:56,107
So you have a side of the bed.
Everybody has a side of the bed.

301
00:19:56,344 --> 00:19:59,245
Hey, come on. You haven't
heard my reason yet.

302
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:01,342
All right, go on.

303
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,014
I have to sleep on the west side...

304
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:08,347
... because I grew up in California...

305
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:10,181
...and otherwise...

306
00:20:10,691 --> 00:20:13,819
...the ocean would be on the wrong side.

307
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,131
Oh, my God.

308
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:22,199
You're a freak!

309
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:24,670
How about that?

310
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:30,701
Where're you shipping off to?

311
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:32,205
I really can't say.

312
00:20:32,446 --> 00:20:34,676
Do you have nuclear weapons onboard?

313
00:20:35,383 --> 00:20:36,509
I can't say.

314
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,616
Do you get to look through
a periscope thingy?

315
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,686
I'm sorry, but I can't say.

316
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:44,790
Wow, it's neat learning
about submarines.

317
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,393
-I better not miss my flight.
-I'll walk you out.

318
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:51,029
-Bye, Ryan.
-Pleasure. Take care.

319
00:20:56,704 --> 00:21:01,141
So do you think we could get you
one of those uniform things?

320
00:21:02,476 --> 00:21:04,068
You like that, do you?

321
00:21:04,345 --> 00:21:05,573
Oh, yeah.

322
00:21:05,813 --> 00:21:07,178
I'll make some calls.

323
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:12,152
Can you believe that's how
we spent our two weeks?

324
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:14,184
We didn't do the romantic
things I'd planned...

325
00:21:14,388 --> 00:21:19,018
...Iike having a picnic in Central Park
and coffee at Central Perk.

326
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:20,717
Oh, I just got that!

327
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:31,402
Taxi!

328
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:38,535
Bye, you.

329
00:21:52,026 --> 00:21:53,459
I'm sorry, we're

330
00:21:56,964 --> 00:21:58,158
Hey, sailor.

331
00:21:58,366 --> 00:21:59,993
Is this what you had in mind?

332
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:02,399
I'll say.

333
00:22:08,476 --> 00:22:10,467
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

334
00:22:11,012 --> 00:22:12,343
Well, then...

335
00:22:14,582 --> 00:22:16,550
...we better make this night count.

336
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,753
Wait, I forgot to turn off
the cappuccino machine.

337
00:22:30,498 --> 00:22:32,227
Anchors aweigh.

338
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:37,063
Oh, wait, wait!
My purse, my purse!

339
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,504
I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.

340
00:22:45,713 --> 00:22:47,772
Why don't I just meet you upstairs?

341
00:22:52,787 --> 00:22:53,719
Honey!
