1
00:00:04,583 --> 00:00:07,484
Oh, you know, Monica's gonna freak
if every box isn't labeled.

2
00:00:08,053 --> 00:00:10,715
You're right, yeah. Okay....

3
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:15,516
"Box of crap."

4
00:00:17,195 --> 00:00:21,325
It's so wild. When Monica and Chandler
come back, they are gonna have a baby.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,058
- A baby!
- I know.

6
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:25,260
Wait. Ross doesn't know
the baby's coming.

7
00:00:25,437 --> 00:00:26,768
Should we call and tell him?

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,100
I don't know.
Rachel's still there yelling at him.

9
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:31,299
Poor guy. I would not
wanna be him right now.

10
00:00:35,347 --> 00:00:37,144
Wait. Wait. Should we be doing this?

11
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:38,749
I don't know.

12
00:00:39,718 --> 00:00:43,279
- It's probably not a really good idea.
- Yeah, probably not.

13
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,952
- Well, that never stopped us before.
- No, sir!

14
00:01:41,546 --> 00:01:43,741
I can't believe we're gonna
be parents soon.

15
00:01:43,915 --> 00:01:45,780
I can't believe it's three weeks early.

16
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:48,511
I love that our baby is prompt.

17
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:52,115
Okay. All right, what room
did the nurse say Erica was in?

18
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:54,415
- 702.
- Okay.

19
00:01:55,794 --> 00:01:57,728
- Come on, baby.
- Come on. You can do this.

20
00:01:57,896 --> 00:02:01,093
Get this damn thing out of me!

21
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,228
Well, these are for you.

22
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,312
Did you see the size of the thing
that was coming out of that woman?

23
00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:18,848
I couldn't tell who was
giving birth to who.

24
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:26,914
- Hi.
- Hey. How's it going?

25
00:02:27,092 --> 00:02:30,061
It's okay. The doctor says
it'll still be a while.

26
00:02:30,228 --> 00:02:32,924
- How do you feel?
- Well, it hurts sometimes.

27
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:36,233
Not too bad yet, though.
It's a little scary.

28
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:38,528
Oh, I know.
But, honey, you're gonna be fine.

29
00:02:38,704 --> 00:02:42,640
Tell that to the lady in 702
with the toddler coming out of her.

30
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:45,300
I think that kid was wearing a shirt.

31
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:49,113
You're gonna be fine, though.

32
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:58,685
Hey.

33
00:02:59,257 --> 00:03:01,953
Go back to sleep. I have to go home.

34
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:05,722
Oh, God. This was amazing.

35
00:03:06,631 --> 00:03:08,724
It really was.

36
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:11,835
You've learned some new moves.

37
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:17,640
Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me
<i>Sex for Dummies</i> as a joke.

38
00:03:17,843 --> 00:03:20,869
- Who's laughing now?
- I am.

39
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:26,815
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

40
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,710
Okay. Good.

41
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:31,411
Next time, can I say "breathe"?

42
00:03:31,656 --> 00:03:34,648
No. Last time, you said it
like Dracula, and it scared her.

43
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:38,426
Do you want some more ice chips?

44
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:41,564
- No, I'm okay.
- All right. I'll be right back.

45
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:46,231
- Where you going?
- To use the bathroom.

46
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:49,839
- You can't leave me alone with her.
- What?

47
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,839
This is exactly
the kind of social situation...

48
00:03:53,011 --> 00:03:54,911
...that I am not comfortable with.

49
00:03:55,947 --> 00:03:59,212
What kind of social situation
are you comfortable with?

50
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:03,680
It's just that we've never spent
any time, you know, alone together.

51
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:07,347
You'll be fine. You won't,
but I'll be back in two minutes.

52
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:09,153
Okay.

53
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:20,769
So any plans for the summer?

54
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:24,874
I don't know. Maybe church camp.

55
00:04:29,748 --> 00:04:32,239
May not want to mention this.

56
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,384
So you ever wonder which is worse?

57
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:41,720
You know, going through labor
or getting kicked in the nuts?

58
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:45,922
- What?
- Oh, it's just interesting.

59
00:04:46,097 --> 00:04:50,796
Because no one will ever know
because no one can experience both.

60
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:58,101
One of life's great
unanswerable questions.

61
00:04:59,578 --> 00:05:04,447
Who knows? Maybe there's something
even more painful than those things.

62
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:09,016
Like this.

63
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:16,858
- Come in.
- Morning.

64
00:05:17,028 --> 00:05:18,757
- Hey.
- What's that?

65
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,457
Oh, it's my housewarming present
for Monica and Chandler.

66
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:25,903
That's a baby chick and duck.

67
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:28,972
And I named them Chick Jr.
And Duck Jr.

68
00:05:29,474 --> 00:05:32,238
I did not see that coming.

69
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:35,345
They'll love it at that new house.
It has that big backyard.

70
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:37,640
When they're old,
they'll go to that farm...

71
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:40,683
...that Chandler took
the other chick and duck to.

72
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,451
- Yes.
- Yeah.

73
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:47,785
- It's a shame people can't visit there.
- That is the rule though.

74
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:54,230
- Guess what. You're almost an uncle.
- What?

75
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,891
Erica went into labor. Monica and
Chandler are at the hospital right now.

76
00:05:58,136 --> 00:06:01,003
- Oh, my God!
- I have a feeling it's gonna be a girl.

77
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:03,800
Phoebe, you were sure Ben
was gonna be a girl.

78
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:06,204
Have you seen him throw a ball?

79
00:06:08,647 --> 00:06:11,673
- Is Rachel here?
- I think she's still asleep.

80
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:16,412
How did it go with you guys last night?
She seemed pretty pissed at you.

81
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:19,681
We worked things out.

82
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:23,692
What's that smile?
Did something happen with you two?

83
00:06:23,895 --> 00:06:26,329
Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell.

84
00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:30,366
But I'm also not one to have sex
and shut up. We totally did it.

85
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:33,436
Oh, my God. You and Rachel?

86
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:36,539
- I know, it's pretty great.
- So, what does that mean?

87
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,370
- Are you guys getting back together?
- Oh, I don't know.

88
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:42,877
- We didn't really get to talk.
- But do you want to get back together?

89
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:45,072
I don't know.

90
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,879
It was incredible.
I mean, it just felt so right.

91
00:06:49,054 --> 00:06:54,117
When I was holding her, I mean,
I never wanted to let her go.

92
00:06:55,193 --> 00:06:57,320
Know what? Yeah, I do.
I want to be together.

93
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:03,764
So is she still going to Paris?

94
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,870
Wow, I hadn't thought of that.
I hope not.

95
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:10,769
This is, like, the best day ever. Ever.
You guys might get back together.

96
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:14,070
Monica and Chandler get their baby.
There are chicks and ducks...

97
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:16,076
...in the world again.

98
00:07:17,048 --> 00:07:19,346
I feel like I'm in a musical.

99
00:07:26,124 --> 00:07:28,957
- Morning.
- Guess you'll never know how it ends.

100
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:31,885
- Hey.
- Hi.

101
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:35,157
- Hi. How'd you sleep?
- Good. You?

102
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,858
- Good.
- I'll bet you did.

103
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:42,563
Would you guys mind
giving us a minute?

104
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:45,004
Sure. Just keep an eye
on the chick and duck.

105
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:47,177
Chick and the duck?
Didn't they die--?

106
00:07:47,412 --> 00:07:53,612
Dive. Yeah, they dove.
Headfirst into fun on the farm.

107
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,092
So....

108
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:08,030
- Morning.
- You too.

109
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,033
- Last night was just wonderful.
- Oh, it really was.

110
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:14,398
I woke up today with the biggest smile.

111
00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:16,631
I know, me too. It was....

112
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:20,539
You know, it was one of those things
you think is never going to happen.

113
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:24,478
And then it does,
and it's everything you want it to be.

114
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:27,281
I know. It was just....

115
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:31,853
It's just the perfect way
to say goodbye.

116
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:43,190
- Just a little bit more, honey.
- Oh, man, this hurts!

117
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:45,199
Is it really that bad?

118
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:49,339
I think it's time to kick you
in the nuts and see which is worse.

119
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:53,808
The baby's head is crowning.

120
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:58,574
Oh, my God! That is the most beautiful
top of a head I have ever seen.

121
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,153
- Chandler, you have to see this.
- I'm okay.

122
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:06,255
You don't want to miss this.
This is the birth of your child.

123
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,950
- It's the miracle of life.
- All right.

124
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:15,392
Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.

125
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:18,165
Start pushing. Here we go.

126
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:20,463
Here come the shoulders.

127
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:29,279
It's a boy.

128
00:09:29,514 --> 00:09:32,210
- Is he okay?
- He's just fine.

129
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:34,214
You did it.

130
00:09:34,385 --> 00:09:36,012
It's a baby.

131
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:41,989
A beautiful little baby. And some other
stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.

132
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:46,489
- Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?
- Okay.

133
00:09:50,902 --> 00:09:52,733
Well, that's spongy.

134
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,275
Hey, handsome.

135
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:05,310
I'll love you so much that no woman
is ever gonna be good enough for you.

136
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:10,114
- We are so lucky.
- I know.

137
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:13,455
He has your eyes.

138
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:18,517
I mean, I know that's not possible,
but he does.

139
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,255
We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.

140
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:25,902
Oh, my God, he's beautiful.

141
00:10:26,337 --> 00:10:30,137
- Thank you so much.
- I'm really happy for you guys.

142
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:33,670
- How do you feel?
- I'm tired.

143
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:38,646
You don't have that much time to relax.
The other one will be along in a minute.

144
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:47,086
I'm sorry, who should be along
in a what, now?

145
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,351
The next baby should be
along in a minute.

146
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:54,327
We only ordered one.

147
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,328
- You know it's twins, right?
- Oh, yeah.

148
00:10:58,503 --> 00:11:01,961
These are the faces
of two people in the know.

149
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:06,937
I can't believe you didn't know it's twins.
This has never happened before.

150
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:10,876
Well, gosh. That makes me
feel so special and good.

151
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:12,549
Did you know it was twins?

152
00:11:12,717 --> 00:11:15,277
It's here in the paperwork
we got from the clinic.

153
00:11:15,687 --> 00:11:18,554
- Did anybody tell you?
- I don't think so.

154
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:23,786
They did mention two heartbeats, but l
thought it was just mine and the baby's.

155
00:11:23,962 --> 00:11:25,827
They said,
"Both heartbeats are strong."

156
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:29,398
And I thought, "Well, that's good,
because I'm having a baby."

157
00:11:30,702 --> 00:11:33,796
- This is unbelievable.
- Twins actually run in my family.

158
00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:35,700
Interesting.

159
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:39,141
Can I see you for a second?

160
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:43,847
- What do we do?
- What do you mean, "What do we do?"

161
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:45,572
Twins!

162
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,650
Twins!

163
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:52,115
- Chandler, you're panicking.
- Join me, won't you?

164
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:57,422
What do you say we keep one and then
just have an option on the other one?

165
00:11:57,729 --> 00:12:00,220
- We can't split them up.
- Why not?

166
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:02,558
We could give each of them
half a medallion.

167
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:05,396
And then years later,
they'll find each other...

168
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:12,371
...and be reunited. I mean,
that's a great day for everybody.

169
00:12:12,543 --> 00:12:15,637
What if the person who adopts
the other one is horrible?

170
00:12:15,847 --> 00:12:18,782
What if they're not?
What if it's adopted by a king?

171
00:12:19,017 --> 00:12:22,350
Yeah. Because I hear the king
is looking to adopt.

172
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,580
Monica, we are not ready
to have two babies.

173
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,123
That doesn't matter.
We have waited so long for this.

174
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:32,525
I don't care if it's two babies.
I don't care if it's three babies.

175
00:12:32,697 --> 00:12:36,428
I don't care if the entire cast
of <i>Eight Is Enough</i> comes out of there.

176
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:41,432
We are taking them home
because they are our children.

177
00:12:41,673 --> 00:12:43,607
Okay.

178
00:12:45,576 --> 00:12:46,873
- Okay.
- Okay!

179
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:48,875
Okay.

180
00:12:49,414 --> 00:12:52,144
It looks like we're about ready
over here. Come on, Erica.

181
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:54,410
Start pushing again now.

182
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:59,482
- Here she comes.
- She? It's a girl?

183
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:01,282
Yeah.

184
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:04,761
Well, now we have one of each.

185
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,960
And that's enough.

186
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:15,198
And then she said it was
the perfect way to say goodbye.

187
00:13:15,506 --> 00:13:18,907
Oh, my God. What did you say?

188
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,570
- Nothing. What do you say to that?
- You've got to tell her how you feel.

189
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:26,181
- No way.
- Well, you can't just give up.

190
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:28,717
Is that what a dinosaur would do?

191
00:13:30,154 --> 00:13:34,022
- What?
- I'm just trying to speak your language.

192
00:13:34,225 --> 00:13:37,285
Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you
even wanna get back together.

193
00:13:37,462 --> 00:13:41,523
If she did, she might feel differently.
She might not even go.

194
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:44,164
- You really think so?
- I'm telling you!

195
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:48,931
Oh, this is the part of the musical where
there'd be a good, convincing song.

196
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:59,774
- Hi.
- Can't a girl finish a song around here?

197
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:02,511
- Hey.
- Hi. I dropped Emma off at my mom's.

198
00:14:02,687 --> 00:14:04,814
- Okay.
- You're not taking her tonight?

199
00:14:05,022 --> 00:14:09,789
We decided I'd set up, then my mom
would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.

200
00:14:09,994 --> 00:14:12,292
Eight-hour flight with a baby.
Good luck, Mom.

201
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:17,059
You kidding? Eight hours with my mom
talking about Atkins. Good luck, Emma.

202
00:14:19,137 --> 00:14:23,301
All right. You know what? You're right.
I should at least tell her how I feel.

203
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:25,704
- Ross. Wait, wait.
- What? What?

204
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,502
Could you get me a muffin?

205
00:14:31,082 --> 00:14:33,482
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

206
00:14:33,651 --> 00:14:40,284
I know you're leaving tonight,
but I just have to tell you.

207
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:43,155
I love you.

208
00:14:44,896 --> 00:14:48,229
Now, I don't know
if that changes your plans at all.

209
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,859
But I thought you should know.

210
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:56,166
Gunther.

211
00:14:58,075 --> 00:15:02,739
I love you too.
Probably not in the same way.

212
00:15:02,914 --> 00:15:08,181
But I do. And when I'm
in a café having coffee...

213
00:15:08,352 --> 00:15:11,844
...or I see a man with hair
brighter than the sun...

214
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:15,421
...I'll think of you.

215
00:15:21,766 --> 00:15:24,200
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye.

216
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:29,833
Oh, my God!

217
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,407
Unbelievable.

218
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:36,240
- Hey, you know what might help?
- I'm not getting you a muffin!

219
00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:47,891
Do you think they recognize
each other from in there?

220
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:51,085
Maybe. Unless they're like people
who've lived in apartments...

221
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:55,096
...next to each other for years, then one
day they're pushed through a vagina...

222
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:57,632
...and they meet.

223
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:00,167
We're going to take Erica
to Recovery now.

224
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:02,498
There's something
that we wanted to tell you.

225
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:08,002
We decided to name the girl baby Erica.

226
00:16:09,113 --> 00:16:11,479
Oh, my God, that's just like my name!

227
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:15,882
Son of a gun, it is.

228
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:20,420
Anyway, I'm gonna go get some rest.

229
00:16:21,025 --> 00:16:26,258
I'm really glad I picked you guys.
You're gonna make great parents.

230
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,455
Even Chandler.

231
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:32,492
- Okay, well, bye.
- Bye.

232
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,103
- We'll call you.
- Okay.

233
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:36,706
Have fun at church camp.

234
00:16:42,513 --> 00:16:46,210
- Look at these little bunnies.
- I know.

235
00:16:46,684 --> 00:16:48,618
You ready to trade?

236
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:51,549
- Okay.
- Okay.

237
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:53,780
Okay. Let's see.

238
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,325
- We could trade later.
- Yeah, I'm good.

239
00:17:08,739 --> 00:17:13,005
- Hey, what are you working on?
- A "welcome home" sign for the baby.

240
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:16,044
How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?

241
00:17:17,748 --> 00:17:19,238
No, I sat in the paint.

242
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:23,342
- Hey.
- So did you talk to Rachel?

243
00:17:23,521 --> 00:17:26,513
- No. And I'm not going to.
- What?

244
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:29,057
- Why not?
- She's just gonna shoot me down.

245
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:32,252
You saw what happened with Gunther.
That did not look like fun.

246
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:34,828
How can you compare
yourself to Gunther?

247
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:39,902
I mean, sure, he's sexy
in a more obvious way.

248
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:43,596
You have a relationship with her.
You slept together last night.

249
00:17:43,841 --> 00:17:47,675
Yeah, and she still wants to go.
It's pretty clear where she is.

250
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:50,038
I know what you mean.
I mean, sometimes--

251
00:17:50,247 --> 00:17:53,045
- Joe.
- Damn it!

252
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,878
If I were gonna tell her,
I don't have to do it now.

253
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:58,453
Okay? I'll be seeing her again.
We've got time.

254
00:17:58,623 --> 00:18:02,855
No, you don't. She's going to Paris!
She is going to meet somebody.

255
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:08,294
Do you know how many hot guys there
are in Paris? It's a city of Gunthers.

256
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:12,802
- Hey.
- Hey.

257
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:15,666
- What do you have there?
- Oh, I made a little something.

258
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,570
If I had more time to work on it,
it'd be better, but....

259
00:18:20,711 --> 00:18:24,511
- Oh, my God, you did that yourself?
- Honey, that's gorgeous.

260
00:18:24,715 --> 00:18:28,151
You know, the baby can't read, Mike.

261
00:18:29,353 --> 00:18:33,346
Hi. The car service just got here.
I can't believe they're not home yet!

262
00:18:33,524 --> 00:18:36,186
I have to catch my stupid plane.
I want to see the baby.

263
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,887
Monica just called from the cab.
She said they should be here any minute.

264
00:18:40,064 --> 00:18:43,727
- Apparently, there's some big surprise.
- Yeah, did she sound happy about it?

265
00:18:43,901 --> 00:18:47,928
Because my friend Ethel's baby
was born with a teeny-tiny beard.

266
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:56,504
- Welcome home.
- Oh, my God.

267
00:18:57,581 --> 00:19:00,379
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hey.

268
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:02,609
Hey.

269
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:07,889
Hey, so, what is the big surprise?

270
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,723
- Oh, my God!
- How did this--?

271
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:17,925
Okay, awkward question.
The hospital knows you took two, right?

272
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:21,972
- Yes. It's twins.
- Oh, my-- They are so cute.

273
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:27,634
- Now, what kinds are they?
- This is a boy. And that's a girl.

274
00:19:27,845 --> 00:19:29,437
Her name is Erica.

275
00:19:30,414 --> 00:19:33,247
Hey, that pregnant girl's name
was Erica.

276
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:37,581
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't
get to spend more time together.

277
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:40,922
Yeah, and we named the boy Jack,
after Dad.

278
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:45,425
- He's gonna be so happy.
- Jack Bing. I love that.

279
00:19:45,596 --> 00:19:49,726
It sounds like a '40s newspaper guy.
You know, "Jack Bing, <i>Morning Gazette.</i>

280
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,098
I'm gonna blow this story wide open."

281
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:59,099
Oh, my gosh.

282
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,177
- So beautiful.
- I want one.

283
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:07,749
Oh, yeah? Well, tell me which one.
I'll try to slip it in my coat.

284
00:20:08,452 --> 00:20:10,977
Seriously. I mean,
you want to make one of those?

285
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:13,349
- One? How about a whole bunch?
- Really?

286
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:18,791
Yeah. We can teach them to sing, and
we could be like the von Trapp family.

287
00:20:18,963 --> 00:20:22,126
Only without the Nazis.
Although that sounds kind of dull.

288
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:27,198
I can't believe this. If I don't leave now,
I'm gonna miss my plane.

289
00:20:27,438 --> 00:20:31,340
- I'm so glad you got to see the babies.
- Me too.

290
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:36,104
I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to
watch you two attempt to handle this.

291
00:20:37,648 --> 00:20:41,516
All right. Oh, I can't say goodbye
to you guys again.

292
00:20:41,685 --> 00:20:43,983
- I love you all so much.
- Love you.

293
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:46,349
- We love you.
- Call us when you get there.

294
00:20:46,557 --> 00:20:50,118
I will. Ross, come here.

295
00:20:52,997 --> 00:20:54,828
I just want you to know...

296
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:58,426
...last night...

297
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,134
...I'll never forget it.

298
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:04,964
Neither will l.

299
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,041
All right. Now I really have to go.

300
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:18,711
Okay, <i>au revoir</i>.

301
00:21:19,957 --> 00:21:22,551
They're gonna really hate me
over there.

302
00:21:24,895 --> 00:21:27,728
So you just let her go?

303
00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:29,725
Yeah.

304
00:21:30,768 --> 00:21:33,532
- Hey, maybe that's for the best.
- Yeah?

305
00:21:33,704 --> 00:21:36,764
Yeah. You know, you just--
Look, you gotta--

306
00:21:36,974 --> 00:21:39,534
You gotta think about last night
the way she does.

307
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,974
Okay? You know, maybe....

308
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,677
Maybe sleeping together was
the perfect way to say goodbye.

309
00:21:48,752 --> 00:21:50,583
They slept together?

310
00:21:50,754 --> 00:21:52,619
I was with you.

311
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:58,690
- Now she'll never know how he feels.
- Maybe that's okay, you know?

312
00:21:58,863 --> 00:22:01,024
Maybe it is better this way.

313
00:22:01,198 --> 00:22:05,328
I mean, now.... Now you can move on.

314
00:22:05,536 --> 00:22:08,164
I mean, you've been trying to
for so long.

315
00:22:08,372 --> 00:22:11,205
Maybe now that you're
on different continents....

316
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,002
Right?

317
00:22:17,047 --> 00:22:20,483
Maybe now you can actually do it,
you know.

318
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:23,885
You can finally get over her.

319
00:22:27,892 --> 00:22:30,156
Yeah, that's true.

320
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:32,919
Except....

321
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:37,866
- I don't want to get over her.
- What?

322
00:22:38,035 --> 00:22:41,027
- I don't. I want to be with her.
- Really?

323
00:22:41,238 --> 00:22:43,706
- Yeah. I'm going to go after her.
- Yeah, you are!

324
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:48,373
Wait! Wait!
Get your coat! Get your coat!

325
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:50,547
- My coat.
- This is so cool!

326
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:53,842
I have no idea what's going on,
but I am excited!

327
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:56,542
- What do you think she's gonna say?
- I don't know.

328
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,282
Even if she shoots me down, at least
I won't spend my life wondering...

329
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:04,052
...what would have happened.
Where is my coat?

330
00:23:04,261 --> 00:23:08,561
You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs.
I'll drive you to the airport.

331
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:10,097
- Wish me luck.
- Hurry!

332
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:11,825
Good luck!

333
00:23:16,206 --> 00:23:17,639
Oh, my God.

334
00:23:17,808 --> 00:23:20,777
Ross is going after Rachel.
And you guys have babies.

335
00:23:20,945 --> 00:23:23,072
This is, like, the best day ever!

336
00:23:23,714 --> 00:23:27,707
Why is there an ass-shaped paint stain
on my couch?

337
00:23:30,854 --> 00:23:32,879
She asked you a question, Mike.

338
00:23:41,465 --> 00:23:43,262
You really think we'll make it in time?

339
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:46,562
Hey, I didn't have my license taken away
because I drive carefully.

340
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:54,233
- There's no seat belts!
- That's okay. If we hit anything...

341
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:59,508
...the engine will explode, so it's better
if you're thrown from the car.

342
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,742
- All right, all right. Let's do this.
- Okay!

343
00:24:04,154 --> 00:24:05,781
- Hey!
- 80th and East End.

344
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,289
- No. I don't take passengers.
- The law makes you accept any fare.

345
00:24:09,493 --> 00:24:11,518
You don't understand.
This cab isn't real.

346
00:24:11,762 --> 00:24:13,627
What's your medallion number?

347
00:24:13,831 --> 00:24:16,163
My medallion number is,
get out of the cab!

348
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,659
- What?
- Get out of the cab!

349
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:32,008
Hey, you guys. Check this out.

350
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:38,885
- No!
- Okay.

351
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:45,351
Oh, hey, can I give you guys
my housewarming gift now?

352
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:48,622
- Now, that you can do.
- All right.

353
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:50,931
I have a question.

354
00:24:51,101 --> 00:24:54,434
Without looking under their diapers,
can you tell them apart?

355
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,065
Of course I can, I'm their mother.

356
00:24:58,242 --> 00:25:01,734
Oh, yeah? Okay. Which one is that one?

357
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:03,241
That's Jack.

358
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:12,182
Jack's gonna have a tough time
in high school with that vagina.

359
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:26,468
Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.?

360
00:25:27,938 --> 00:25:30,805
Don't hide from Mama!

361
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,414
You can open your eyes now.

362
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:43,018
- Are we off the bridge?
- Yes!

363
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:48,749
- Is the woman on the bicycle still alive?
- Yeah, she jumped right back up.

364
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:53,161
- Oh, my God. Phoebe, slow down!
- Do you want to get to Rachel in time?

365
00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:55,524
Yes, but I don't want
to die in your cab.

366
00:25:55,732 --> 00:25:59,259
You should have thought of that
before you got in!

367
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,297
- Tollbooth.
- What?

368
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:03,768
Tollbooth!

369
00:26:03,974 --> 00:26:06,670
Four bucks. There are quarters
in the glove compartment.

370
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:10,674
Hurry!

371
00:26:11,615 --> 00:26:14,641
Okay.

372
00:26:14,852 --> 00:26:17,116
Damn, that window's clean.

373
00:26:34,004 --> 00:26:36,564
We were wondering
what was taking so long...

374
00:26:36,773 --> 00:26:39,970
...but now we understand.
You were doing this.

375
00:26:42,112 --> 00:26:45,275
Okay. I wanted to surprise you, but....

376
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:49,715
For your housewarming gift,
I got you a baby chick and a baby duck.

377
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,518
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?

378
00:26:52,689 --> 00:26:58,218
Oh, great. Just what you want for
a new house with infants. Bird feces!

379
00:26:58,395 --> 00:27:01,057
But they must've jumped off the table.
Now they're gone!

380
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:02,698
Don't worry, we'll find them.

381
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,334
Actually, I'm gonna go check
on the twins.

382
00:27:05,502 --> 00:27:08,630
Oh, God! What did I just step on?

383
00:27:09,106 --> 00:27:11,734
It's okay. It's just an egg roll.

384
00:27:11,975 --> 00:27:15,172
You stepped on my egg roll?!

385
00:27:15,379 --> 00:27:18,542
I'm sorry. I didn't know to look
for Chinese food on the floor.

386
00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:20,341
Just put it on a plate and leave.

387
00:27:24,521 --> 00:27:28,048
- Okay. Let's find these birds.
- All right.

388
00:27:30,861 --> 00:27:33,853
Wait, wait. You hear that?

389
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:40,667
- They're in the table!
- Well, that can't be good.

390
00:27:40,837 --> 00:27:42,828
- We gotta get them out of there!
- How?

391
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,702
Maybe we can lure them out.
You know any birdcalls?

392
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:48,571
Oh, tons. I'm quite the woodsman.

393
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,045
Well, maybe we can just
tip the table a little.

394
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,048
Joey, wait! The ball!

395
00:28:12,102 --> 00:28:13,433
So, what do we do?

396
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:15,572
Maybe we can open this up somehow.

397
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:17,366
Okay.

398
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:22,205
No. It's all glued together.

399
00:28:22,412 --> 00:28:25,404
Does that mean
we have to bust it open?

400
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:29,382
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Oh, my God.

401
00:28:29,553 --> 00:28:35,048
I know. It's-- It's the foosball table.

402
00:28:36,226 --> 00:28:38,558
All right, you know what?
We don't have a choice.

403
00:28:38,729 --> 00:28:43,666
It's like I would have said in that
sci-fi movie if I'd have gotten the part.

404
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:46,997
Those are our men in there,
and we have to get them out...

405
00:28:47,738 --> 00:28:51,174
...even if I have to sacrifice
the most important thing in my life...

406
00:28:51,341 --> 00:28:54,742
...my time machine.

407
00:28:54,911 --> 00:28:57,778
- Did that movie ever get made?
- It did not.

408
00:29:01,985 --> 00:29:04,783
<i>Jack Weinberg, white courtesy phone.</i>
<i>Jack Weinberg.</i>

409
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:07,287
- Ross, where are you going?
- To talk to Rachel.

410
00:29:07,457 --> 00:29:10,119
Isn't that why we took a ride
in the death cab?

411
00:29:10,327 --> 00:29:12,124
You're walking up to her at the gate?

412
00:29:12,296 --> 00:29:14,958
Have you never chased anyone
through the airport before?

413
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:17,463
Not since my cop show got canceled.

414
00:29:18,535 --> 00:29:20,969
You have to get a ticket
to get past security.

415
00:29:21,171 --> 00:29:25,130
- What? We're never gonna make it.
- Not with that attitude. Now, haul ass!

416
00:29:27,544 --> 00:29:31,844
Okay, if you could all walk slower,
that'd be great.

417
00:29:38,522 --> 00:29:41,889
- Madame, your passport, please.
- Oh, my God.

418
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:44,789
I was afraid I wouldn't remember
my high school French.

419
00:29:44,961 --> 00:29:47,794
But I understood every word
you just said.

420
00:29:48,465 --> 00:29:51,798
- Your boarding pass, please.
- Oh, sure.

421
00:29:54,037 --> 00:29:57,564
Shoot, I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.

422
00:29:57,974 --> 00:30:00,704
- Madame, if you don't have your--
- I have it, I have it!

423
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,245
Okay, I can't find it, but I remember
that I was in seat 32C...

424
00:30:08,418 --> 00:30:11,046
...because that's my bra size.

425
00:30:11,922 --> 00:30:13,651
You must have your boarding pass--

426
00:30:13,857 --> 00:30:17,224
You know what? If I was in 36D,
we would not be having this problem.

427
00:30:25,068 --> 00:30:27,536
- Hi. I need a ticket.
- Just one?

428
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:30,536
I drive you here, and I don't get
to see how it works out?

429
00:30:30,741 --> 00:30:36,043
- Fine. Two tickets. I need two tickets.
- We're on our honeymoon.

430
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,911
- And the destination?
- I don't care. Whatever's the cheapest.

431
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,418
I'm so lucky I married you.

432
00:30:44,688 --> 00:30:48,749
Oh, shoot. Damn it. Where is it?

433
00:30:49,693 --> 00:30:53,026
I found it. I found it.
I told you I would find it.

434
00:30:53,196 --> 00:30:56,757
In your face. You're a different person.

435
00:30:56,967 --> 00:30:58,832
Sorry.

436
00:30:59,236 --> 00:31:03,195
Okay. Flight 421, Paris.

437
00:31:03,907 --> 00:31:06,398
- I don't see it. Do you see it?
- No. Did we miss it?

438
00:31:06,576 --> 00:31:09,909
No, no, it's impossible.
It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.

439
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,640
Maybe we have
the flight number wrong.

440
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:14,783
God.

441
00:31:17,053 --> 00:31:18,748
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.

442
00:31:18,922 --> 00:31:21,220
What?

443
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:22,722
Hey. Hey, listen--

444
00:31:22,926 --> 00:31:27,090
You wouldn't believe the cute noises
the twins are making. Wait, listen.

445
00:31:27,297 --> 00:31:29,492
But Monica--

446
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:34,069
Monica. Monica. Monica.

447
00:31:35,005 --> 00:31:36,802
I'm sorry. They were doing it before.

448
00:31:37,007 --> 00:31:40,443
- That's all right. Listen, listen.
- Oh, wait, wait. Here they go again.

449
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:44,569
Monica. Monica. Monica.

450
00:31:44,915 --> 00:31:46,473
- <i>Monica?</i>
- Isn't that cute?

451
00:31:46,683 --> 00:31:49,618
That is precious! Listen....

452
00:31:49,786 --> 00:31:53,085
- I need Rachel's flight information.
- <i>Oh, okay.</i>

453
00:31:53,523 --> 00:31:59,018
- All right, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
- I have that. It's not on the board.

454
00:31:59,196 --> 00:32:03,394
That's what it says here. Flight 421.
Leaves at 8:40. Newark Airport.

455
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,898
- What?
- <i>Newark Airport.</i>

456
00:32:06,102 --> 00:32:10,539
- Why? Where are you?
- JFK.

457
00:32:39,135 --> 00:32:42,696
Don't worry, you guys!
We're gonna get you out of there!

458
00:32:43,707 --> 00:32:47,404
And we're also gonna buy you
tiny bird hearing aids.

459
00:32:53,149 --> 00:32:56,482
Okay. Here goes.

460
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:02,852
What's the matter?

461
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,996
I need to say goodbye
to the table first.

462
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:10,363
I understand.

463
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:12,695
Okay.

464
00:33:16,306 --> 00:33:18,740
Table...

465
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,037
...you have given us
so many great times.

466
00:33:25,315 --> 00:33:31,948
And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel....

467
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:35,825
All of you guys. What can I say?

468
00:33:35,992 --> 00:33:41,521
You guys make us look good.

469
00:33:44,768 --> 00:33:47,828
- You want to say anything?
- I don't know.

470
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:53,733
Except that, for one last time....

471
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:58,237
Good game. Good game. Good game.

472
00:34:00,884 --> 00:34:02,511
Good game.

473
00:34:05,989 --> 00:34:07,980
Okay. Here we go.

474
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:18,090
I can't do it.

475
00:34:18,902 --> 00:34:20,563
Well, I can't do it either.

476
00:34:21,738 --> 00:34:24,730
- Hey. Did you find them?
- Yeah. They're stuck inside the table.

477
00:34:24,908 --> 00:34:27,604
And we have to bust it open,
but neither of us can do it.

478
00:34:27,777 --> 00:34:33,010
Oh, well, sure. It's got to be so hard.

479
00:34:33,216 --> 00:34:35,912
I'll do it. Give me.

480
00:34:40,123 --> 00:34:41,954
Phoebe!

481
00:34:42,158 --> 00:34:44,217
No, no, no!

482
00:34:45,428 --> 00:34:48,124
Wow, I've never gone this fast before.

483
00:34:48,331 --> 00:34:51,596
Phoebe, forget it, okay?
Newark is, like, an hour away.

484
00:34:51,768 --> 00:34:53,633
There's no way we'll make it in time.

485
00:34:53,837 --> 00:34:57,637
- She's got her cell. You could call her.
- I am not doing this over the phone.

486
00:34:57,841 --> 00:35:00,742
You don't have any other choice.

487
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,850
- Hello?
- Rachel. Oh, good.

488
00:35:09,052 --> 00:35:11,145
By the way,
did you just get on the plane?

489
00:35:11,354 --> 00:35:13,117
- Yeah.
- We would have caught her...

490
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:15,814
...if we were at the right airport.

491
00:35:17,827 --> 00:35:21,786
- Rachel, hang on.
- <i>No. No. No.</i>

492
00:35:21,998 --> 00:35:23,761
Phoebe, is everything okay?

493
00:35:26,136 --> 00:35:30,835
Actually, no. No.
You have to get off the plane.

494
00:35:31,074 --> 00:35:32,939
- What? Why?
- I have this feeling that...

495
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:38,809
...something's wrong with it. Something
is wrong with the left phalange.

496
00:35:40,784 --> 00:35:43,685
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's
nothing wrong with the plane.

497
00:35:43,853 --> 00:35:49,120
Look, I have to go. I love you, and l
will call you the minute I get to Paris.

498
00:35:51,795 --> 00:35:54,855
- What was that?
- Oh, that was just my crazy friend.

499
00:35:55,031 --> 00:35:58,558
She told me to get off the plane
because she had a "feeling" that there...

500
00:35:58,735 --> 00:36:02,466
...was something wrong
with the left phalange.

501
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:06,835
- Okay. That doesn't sound good.
- Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.

502
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,843
She comes up with this stuff,
and she's almost never right.

503
00:36:10,046 --> 00:36:12,674
- But she is sometimes.
- Well....

504
00:36:14,751 --> 00:36:17,083
- What are you doing?
- I can't take this plane now.

505
00:36:17,253 --> 00:36:20,586
- Excuse me, sir. Where are you going?
- I have to get off this plane.

506
00:36:20,757 --> 00:36:24,989
Her friend has a feeling something's
wrong with the left phalange.

507
00:36:29,365 --> 00:36:31,026
Could I get some peanuts?

508
00:36:32,669 --> 00:36:35,433
- What's wrong with the plane?
- There's nothing wrong.

509
00:36:35,638 --> 00:36:38,539
- The left phalange.
- There's no "phalange."

510
00:36:38,742 --> 00:36:41,506
Oh, my God. This plane
doesn't even have a phalange.

511
00:36:43,046 --> 00:36:45,071
- I'm not flying on it.
- Please sit down.

512
00:36:45,281 --> 00:36:49,718
- What's going on?
- We're getting off. There is no phalange!

513
00:36:53,256 --> 00:36:55,781
This is ridiculous. I--

514
00:36:58,027 --> 00:37:00,552
Yeah, okay.

515
00:37:08,438 --> 00:37:11,601
All right. My job here is done.

516
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:15,200
That was impressive.

517
00:37:15,411 --> 00:37:18,938
Yeah. You didn't even use the tools
for most of it.

518
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:21,780
Yeah, they were just slowing me down.

519
00:37:22,118 --> 00:37:26,953
All right. I gotta get back to the babies.
See you girls later.

520
00:37:30,426 --> 00:37:33,725
- Sorry about the table, man.
- Yeah.

521
00:37:34,297 --> 00:37:36,094
You gonna buy a new one?

522
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:39,626
Probably not. No.

523
00:37:39,803 --> 00:37:42,931
I don't know how much I'm gonna
want to play after you go.

524
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:49,340
- At least we got these little guys out.
- Yeah.

525
00:37:49,512 --> 00:37:52,072
We were worried about you.

526
00:37:56,486 --> 00:38:00,820
I guess I better get used to things
crapping in my hand, huh?

527
00:38:09,465 --> 00:38:11,763
I'm gonna miss these little guys.

528
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:13,835
It was nice having birds around again.

529
00:38:15,605 --> 00:38:19,439
Hey, you know what? Maybe we
should keep them here with you.

530
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:22,471
- What?
- Yeah. We got a lot going on right now.

531
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:25,876
And plus, here,
they'd have their own room.

532
00:38:27,016 --> 00:38:29,382
I could get a goose!

533
00:38:30,887 --> 00:38:34,653
You know, I think you're set
with the poultry.

534
00:38:36,826 --> 00:38:39,021
Thanks, man. You hear that, you guys?

535
00:38:39,195 --> 00:38:43,222
You're gonna get to stay here.
And it's good...

536
00:38:43,399 --> 00:38:45,799
...you know, because....

537
00:38:46,502 --> 00:38:49,198
Because now you have
a reason to come visit.

538
00:38:52,008 --> 00:38:55,205
I think there may be another reason.

539
00:39:03,052 --> 00:39:04,849
So....

540
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:11,424
Awkward hug
or lame cool-guy handshake?

541
00:39:12,996 --> 00:39:15,396
Yeah, well, you know,
lame cool-guy handshake.

542
00:39:34,183 --> 00:39:39,587
- Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
- And you fixed the phalange?

543
00:39:40,456 --> 00:39:42,583
Yes. The phalange's fixed.

544
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:47,560
In fact, we've put a whole lot of extra
phalanges onboard, just in case.

545
00:39:49,232 --> 00:39:52,258
<i>Paging Mr. Anderson.</i>
<i>Mr. Josh Anderson.</i>

546
00:39:52,435 --> 00:39:53,925
- Where is she?
- I don't see her.

547
00:39:54,103 --> 00:39:56,435
- Rachel! Rachel Green!
- There she is!

548
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:59,938
Rachel! Rachel!

549
00:40:00,243 --> 00:40:03,701
- Whoa, do you have a boarding pass?
- No. I just have to talk to someone.

550
00:40:03,913 --> 00:40:05,642
I'm sorry. You need a boarding pass.

551
00:40:05,882 --> 00:40:10,478
- No, no. But you don't--
- Rachel!

552
00:40:11,154 --> 00:40:14,590
What? Oh, my God.
What are you guys doing here?

553
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:17,451
Okay. You're on.

554
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,891
What? What, Ross? Okay, you're
scaring me. What's going on?

555
00:40:21,064 --> 00:40:23,999
- Okay. Thing is....
- Yeah.

556
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:26,996
- Don't go.
- What?

557
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:32,233
Please, please stay with me. I am
so in love with you. Please don't go.

558
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:35,504
- Oh, my God.
- I know. I know.

559
00:40:35,678 --> 00:40:40,445
I shouldn't have waited till now to say it,
but-- That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry.

560
00:40:40,616 --> 00:40:43,517
But I'm telling you now. I love you.

561
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:49,887
- Do not get on this plane.
- Miss, are you boarding the plane?

562
00:40:50,259 --> 00:40:51,954
Hey, hey.

563
00:40:52,395 --> 00:40:56,798
I know you love me. I know you do.

564
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:58,994
- Miss.
- I....

565
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:01,500
l.... I have to get on the plane.

566
00:41:01,971 --> 00:41:03,302
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

567
00:41:03,473 --> 00:41:06,101
- No, you don't.
- I do. They're waiting for me, Ross.

568
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:09,836
I can't do this right now, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

569
00:41:10,046 --> 00:41:11,946
Rachel.

570
00:41:12,148 --> 00:41:14,480
I'm so sorry.

571
00:41:29,432 --> 00:41:30,956
I really thought she'd stay.

572
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:33,135
I know.

573
00:41:33,302 --> 00:41:35,429
I'm sorry.

574
00:41:48,518 --> 00:41:51,749
Well, that's it.

575
00:41:51,954 --> 00:41:53,444
Everything's packed.

576
00:41:57,326 --> 00:41:59,658
- This is weird.
- I know.

577
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:01,160
Yeah.

578
00:42:02,532 --> 00:42:04,727
Does this mean there's nothing to eat?

579
00:42:06,335 --> 00:42:08,394
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.

580
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:12,337
I love you.

581
00:42:15,178 --> 00:42:17,840
- Hey.
- Hey. Did you guys make it in time?

582
00:42:18,014 --> 00:42:22,212
Yeah, yeah. He talked to her,
but she got on the plane anyway.

583
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,078
Where's Ross?

584
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:28,484
He went home.
He didn't want to see anybody.

585
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:50,268
<i>Ross. Hi, it's me.</i>

586
00:42:50,513 --> 00:42:55,246
<i>I just got back on the plane,</i>
<i>and I just feel awful.</i>

587
00:42:55,585 --> 00:42:59,885
<i>That is so not how I wanted</i>
<i>things to end with us.</i>

588
00:43:01,057 --> 00:43:04,049
<i>It's just that I wasn't expecting</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

589
00:43:04,227 --> 00:43:07,788
<i>And all of a sudden you're there</i>
<i>and saying these things.</i>

590
00:43:09,165 --> 00:43:12,157
<i>Now I'm just sitting here</i>
<i>and thinking...</i>

591
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:16,101
<i>...of all the stuff I should have said</i>
<i>and I didn't.</i>

592
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:20,139
<i>I mean, I didn't even get to tell you</i>
<i>that I love you too.</i>

593
00:43:21,043 --> 00:43:24,308
<i>Because of course I do. I love you.</i>

594
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:28,283
<i>I love you.</i>

595
00:43:28,985 --> 00:43:30,919
<i>I love you.</i>

596
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,789
<i>What am I doing? I love you.</i>

597
00:43:37,927 --> 00:43:40,953
<i>I've got to see you.</i>
<i>I've got to get off this plane.</i>

598
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:42,859
Oh, my God.

599
00:43:43,065 --> 00:43:46,091
- <i>Okay, excuse me.</i>
- <i>Miss, please sit down.</i>

600
00:43:46,269 --> 00:43:49,432
<i>No, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry,</i>
<i>but I need to get off the plane.</i>

601
00:43:49,605 --> 00:43:52,665
- <i>I need to tell someone that I love them.</i>
- <i>I can't let you off.</i>

602
00:43:52,842 --> 00:43:55,777
Let her off the plane!

603
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:58,274
<i>You have to take your seat.</i>

604
00:43:58,447 --> 00:44:00,938
<i>Oh, please, miss.</i>
<i>You don't understand.</i>

605
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:03,675
Try to understand!

606
00:44:03,886 --> 00:44:07,982
<i>Come on, miss, isn't there any way</i>
<i>that you can just let me off the</i>--<i>?</i>

607
00:44:08,191 --> 00:44:10,022
No! No!

608
00:44:10,526 --> 00:44:15,225
Oh, my God. Did she get off the plane?
Did she get off the plane?

609
00:44:16,632 --> 00:44:19,328
I got off the plane.

610
00:44:29,412 --> 00:44:31,243
You got off the plane.

611
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:46,153
I do love you.

612
00:44:46,362 --> 00:44:48,922
I love you too, and I am never
letting you go again.

613
00:44:49,131 --> 00:44:52,430
Okay. Because this is where I want
to be. No more messing around.

614
00:44:52,635 --> 00:44:56,765
- I don't want to mess this up again.
- Me neither. We're done being stupid.

615
00:44:56,939 --> 00:44:59,567
Okay. It's you and me, all right?
This is it.

616
00:44:59,742 --> 00:45:03,405
This is it. Unless we're on a break.

617
00:45:13,189 --> 00:45:14,884
Don't make jokes now.

618
00:45:35,378 --> 00:45:38,973
Okay, please be careful with that.
It was my grandmother's. Be careful.

619
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:40,739
Thank you.

620
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:44,317
If that falls off the truck,
it wouldn't be the worst thing.

621
00:45:56,232 --> 00:45:57,927
I know.

622
00:45:58,134 --> 00:46:00,830
Seems smaller somehow.

623
00:46:02,271 --> 00:46:05,729
Has it always been purple?

624
00:46:08,277 --> 00:46:12,441
Look around, you guys.
This was your first home.

625
00:46:13,716 --> 00:46:19,746
And it was a happy place,
filled with love and laughter.

626
00:46:19,922 --> 00:46:24,723
But more important, because
of rent control, it was a frigging steal.

627
00:46:28,464 --> 00:46:33,595
Hey, do you realize that, at one time or
another, we all lived in this apartment?

628
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:35,933
Oh, yeah. That's true.

629
00:46:36,672 --> 00:46:38,503
I haven't.

630
00:46:39,608 --> 00:46:42,873
What about that summer during college
that you lived with Grandma...

631
00:46:43,045 --> 00:46:45,809
...and you tried to make it as a dancer?

632
00:46:50,553 --> 00:46:54,512
Do you realize we almost made it
10 years without that coming up?

633
00:46:58,461 --> 00:47:01,897
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised
Treeger that we'd leave our keys.

634
00:47:02,064 --> 00:47:04,294
Oh, okay.

635
00:47:38,334 --> 00:47:41,701
- So I guess this is it.
- Yeah.

636
00:47:43,205 --> 00:47:44,672
I guess so.

637
00:47:46,809 --> 00:47:49,209
This is harder than I thought
it would be.

638
00:47:49,378 --> 00:47:51,903
Oh, it's gonna be okay.

639
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,177
Come on.

640
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:07,624
Do you guys have to go to the new
house now, or do you have some time?

641
00:48:10,332 --> 00:48:11,697
We got some time.

642
00:48:12,334 --> 00:48:16,270
- Okay. Should we get some coffee?
- Sure.

643
00:48:17,373 --> 00:48:19,034
Where?
