1
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:07,142
Hey, how much you give me
to eat this whole jar of olives?

2
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:10,683
l won't give you anything,
but you'll owe me $2.95.

3
00:00:11,557 --> 00:00:13,252
Done.

4
00:00:14,493 --> 00:00:16,586
l need an atlas!
l need an atlas!

5
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:18,821
Why? Do you have a report due?

6
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:23,192
l have a date with this diplomat
l met while giving free massages...

7
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:27,964
...outside the U.N. and....
l don't know where his country is.

8
00:00:28,307 --> 00:00:30,741
Okay, let's start with
the free massages at the U.N.

9
00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:34,743
lt's my new thing. l figure,
bodies at peace make peace.

10
00:00:36,648 --> 00:00:39,640
You might just get
the first Nobel Prize in rubbing.

11
00:00:40,285 --> 00:00:41,946
So, what country is this guy from?

12
00:00:46,758 --> 00:00:47,782
There's a G in there.

13
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:52,024
-Well, where's that?
-ln your atlas.

14
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:54,060
l don't have an atlas.

15
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:56,996
But, wait, l do have a globe.
Hold on.

16
00:00:57,302 --> 00:00:58,667
So what's this guy like?

17
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:01,705
Well, he's very...

18
00:01:01,873 --> 00:01:03,238
...dashing, you know?

19
00:01:03,475 --> 00:01:05,204
And very, very sophisticated.

20
00:01:05,377 --> 00:01:07,038
And he doesn't speak any English...

21
00:01:07,245 --> 00:01:10,442
...but according to his translator
he totally gets me.

22
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:12,445
Okay, here you go.

23
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:14,716
What is this?

24
00:01:15,854 --> 00:01:17,947
lt's a globe.

25
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,157
And a pencil sharpener.

26
00:01:21,727 --> 00:01:24,924
People of Earth, surrender.

27
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,658
Giant alien.

28
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:32,928
Five tiny heads.

29
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:37,273
Anybody need anything copied?
l'm going to the Xerox place.

30
00:01:37,442 --> 00:01:38,431
No, thanks.

31
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,943
Okay, listen, just give me
anything l can make two of.

32
00:01:42,414 --> 00:01:44,575
lf you don't have anything to copy,
why go there?

33
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:49,149
Are you going down there to gawk at that
hot girl with the bellybutton ring again?

34
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:50,887
Yeah. You wanna come?

35
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:54,018
Yeah.

36
00:01:55,927 --> 00:01:57,087
The One Where
Ross and Rachel Take a Break

37
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:47,306
Come on, Chloe.
Finish up with your customer first.

38
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:50,346
Come on, Chloe.
Come on, Chloe!

39
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:51,709
Can l help you?

40
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:55,241
You know what?

41
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,287
We're having second thoughts
about our copying needs...

42
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,789
...and we'll need a little
more time to think about it.

43
00:03:02,194 --> 00:03:05,630
Chloe, switch with me. There are
some guys here who got a crush on you.

44
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:09,358
Okay, that hurt us.

45
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:13,167
Hi, guys. l haven't seen
you since this morning.

46
00:03:13,638 --> 00:03:15,469
Well....

47
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,399
You know.

48
00:03:20,078 --> 00:03:22,546
Hey, what are you guys
doing tomorrow night?

49
00:03:22,714 --> 00:03:23,976
Both of us?

50
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,881
Maybe. Does that scare you?

51
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:34,556
Relax.
Just lsaac's deejaying at The Philly.

52
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,557
-You should come.
-We'll be there.

53
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:39,288
Great. l'll see you then.

54
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:41,193
All right. Rock on.

55
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:59,608
He says that walking with you makes
this strange city feel like home.

56
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:03,182
Me too. Although
this city is my home, so....

57
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:06,347
So that's dumb, what l said.
Don't tell him l said that.

58
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:09,551
Just you make something up.

59
00:04:18,937 --> 00:04:21,235
Nice. Thank you.

60
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:24,072
This is me, here.

61
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:36,013
Your eyes are very pretty.

62
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:39,254
Thank you very much.

63
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:40,413
Oh, thank you.

64
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:51,731
He would like to kiss you.

65
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:58,103
Okay. You know what,
you don't have to do that now.

66
00:04:58,276 --> 00:05:00,267
No, no, not him!
No, you don't.

67
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,575
The moment's over.

68
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:23,900
See, there it is, right there.

69
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:26,162
Wow, it's small.

70
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:29,405
Yeah, but Sergei said
it took the Germans six weeks...

71
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:32,042
...to get all the way across it.

72
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,569
-So you had fun?
-Yeah.

73
00:05:34,746 --> 00:05:37,146
Except for-- You know
when you're on a date...

74
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:39,112
...and you're getting along great...

75
00:05:39,317 --> 00:05:42,047
...but the guy's translator
keeps getting in the way?

76
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,120
No.

77
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:46,783
-Hey.
-Hey.

78
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,482
What, is Rach in her room?

79
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,151
No, she's still at work,
but she said to call her.

80
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:54,594
What? ls she gonna cancel
on me again? How could she do this?

81
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:56,529
Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?

82
00:05:56,701 --> 00:06:00,501
All right, Ross. This is the extent
of my knowledge on the subject.

83
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:01,798
''Call Rachel.''

84
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:04,305
What's that on the bottom?

85
00:06:04,476 --> 00:06:08,378
That's my doodle of
a ladybug with a top hat.

86
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:10,781
She's fancy.

87
00:06:14,185 --> 00:06:15,277
-Hello.
-Hey, honey.

88
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:17,683
-Hi.
-Hey, how's it going?

89
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:20,154
Well, kind of having
an underwear emergency.

90
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:24,421
Oh, yeah? What happened? Someone
scare you? Make you laugh too hard?

91
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:27,224
There was a disaster in shipping.
l have to get this order in.

92
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:30,835
Honey, l'm so sorry, but it looks like
l'm gonna be here all night.

93
00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:33,804
What? Well, how about
l come up there?

94
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:37,840
No. No. No, honey, please. l've got....
l just have too much to deal with.

95
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:41,410
Anyway, l'm going out
with Sergei again tonight, and....

96
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:43,410
Could you be the translator's date...

97
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:47,950
...so that when it's time for our
alone time you two can split off?

98
00:06:49,054 --> 00:06:50,919
You know, he's kind of cute.

99
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:54,422
Kind of cute like really kind of cute?
Or kind of cute like your friend...

100
00:06:54,592 --> 00:06:55,650
...Spackle-Back Larry?

101
00:06:56,528 --> 00:06:58,120
Hey, don't call him that.

102
00:06:58,396 --> 00:07:01,456
His name is Spackle-Back Harry.

103
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,762
You know, maybe we should get going.
What time did Chloe say to get there?

104
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,033
-1 0:30.
-What time is it now?

105
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:13,042
4:30.

106
00:07:13,878 --> 00:07:15,140
Yeah, so we'll hang out.

107
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:23,948
Hey, remember when she brought
up that thing about the three of us?

108
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:26,180
Yes, vividly.

109
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:30,859
-She was kidding about that, right?
-Yeah, l think so.

110
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:36,995
Yeah, l think so.

111
00:07:37,736 --> 00:07:41,866
God, it'd be weird if that situation
presented itself tonight.

112
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:44,974
Yeah, l mean...

113
00:07:45,577 --> 00:07:48,375
...what would we do?

114
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:52,411
Dude, l don't know.

115
00:07:53,351 --> 00:07:54,511
-She was kidding.
-Yeah.

116
00:07:54,686 --> 00:07:56,415
She was....

117
00:07:56,588 --> 00:07:59,318
You know, just in case,
we should come up with ground rules.

118
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:01,425
Yeah. For sure. Okay.

119
00:08:01,593 --> 00:08:04,426
Probably want the first one to be,
''Never open your eyes.''

120
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:10,261
You know? Because you don't
want to be doing something...

121
00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:13,404
...and then look up, right?

122
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:16,333
And see something that
you don't want to be seeing.

123
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:17,770
-You know?
-Yeah.

124
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:20,775
Good call. Nice.
Hold it! Hold it!

125
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,942
What if my eyes are closed, and...?

126
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:28,151
And my hand is out there...?

127
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:31,388
Okay, eyes open at all times.

128
00:08:36,394 --> 00:08:40,023
How do we decide where we...

129
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:41,563
...you know, each would...

130
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,892
...you know...

131
00:08:44,402 --> 00:08:45,801
-...be?
-Right.

132
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,302
Right. Well, you know,
we could flip for it.

133
00:08:48,473 --> 00:08:51,533
Yeah, l guess. But, like,
what's heads and what's tails?

134
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:57,641
Well, if you don't know that,
then l don't want to do this with you.

135
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:01,441
No, no, no.

136
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:05,578
l am looking at a purchase order right here,
and it clearly states that we ordered...

137
00:09:05,757 --> 00:09:10,353
...the Riviera bikini in a variety
of sizes and colors and--

138
00:09:11,563 --> 00:09:14,259
What does it matter what l'm wearing?

139
00:09:14,532 --> 00:09:17,899
Could l please speak to your supervisor?
Thank you. We're holding.

140
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:20,003
-Hi.
-Oh, my God!

141
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:23,937
-What are you doing here?
-Well, you said you couldn't go out, so....

142
00:09:24,142 --> 00:09:27,339
You brought a picnic.
What a boyfriend.

143
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:30,743
That's it. On Monday,
l start wearing makeup.

144
00:09:30,982 --> 00:09:34,611
Ross, honey, this is very nice,
but l've got a crisis.

145
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:36,276
Yeah, but l've got couscous!

146
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:40,413
Honey, l'm sorry,
l know it's our anniversary...

147
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:43,959
...but l told you on the phone,
l don't have time to stop.

148
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:47,690
Okay, you don't have to stop.
l'm invisible. l'm not here.

149
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:49,493
Yeah, but l don't--

150
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:52,135
Who approved that order?

151
00:09:52,303 --> 00:09:55,466
Well, there is no Mark Robinson
in this office.

152
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:58,970
-Get me Mark on the phone!
-l love Mark. Do you know Mark?

153
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:00,635
Yeah.

154
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:03,042
Let me just check that
with what l've got here.

155
00:10:03,214 --> 00:10:06,741
All right. See, 038 is not the number
for this store. 038 is Atlanta.

156
00:10:12,257 --> 00:10:14,054
Pepper?

157
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:17,619
-None for me.
-Okay, sorry....

158
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,622
l'm sorry. As l was saying,
the store number is wrong.

159
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,030
And l'm sorry, but that is--
Oh, my God!

160
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,273
Excuse me, l'm sorry. l'll have to call
you back. l've got Shemp in my office.

161
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,577
-What are you doing?
-l'm sorry.

162
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:45,348
But, hey, somebody's off the phone.
How about a glass of wine...

163
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:48,424
...by the fire?
l can get it going again.

164
00:10:48,593 --> 00:10:52,085
Ross, you're not listening to me.
l don't have time to stop.

165
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:55,198
-Come on, you don't have 1 0 minutes?
-l don't have 1 0 minutes!

166
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:59,063
-Sophie, does she have 1 0 minutes?
-Hey, Ross, l told you l don't!

167
00:10:59,237 --> 00:11:01,967
Don't yell at me, okay? This is
the most l've seen you all week.

168
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:05,637
Look, l cannot do this right now, okay?

169
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,109
l've got a deadline. Would you
just go home. l'll talk to you later.

170
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,575
-Yeah, but wait--
-Goodbye!

171
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,318
Actually, that's our three-hole punch.

172
00:11:27,065 --> 00:11:29,898
-Hey.
-Hi.

173
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:32,332
Look, about what happened earlier--

174
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,028
l completely understand.
You were stressed.

175
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:42,536
l was gonna give you a chance
to apologize to me.

176
00:11:43,248 --> 00:11:45,739
For what? For letting you
throw me out of your office?

177
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:48,977
You had no right
coming down to my office, Ross.

178
00:11:49,153 --> 00:11:52,953
You do not bring a picnic basket
to somebody's work...

179
00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:55,115
...unless maybe they were
a park ranger.

180
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:01,190
Well, excuse me for wanting to be
with my girlfriend on our anniversary.

181
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:02,865
Boy, what an ass am l.

182
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:07,069
But l told you
l didn't have the time.

183
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:08,899
Yeah, well, you never have the time.

184
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:11,667
l don't feel like l even
have a girlfriend anymore.

185
00:12:11,843 --> 00:12:13,003
What do you want from me?

186
00:12:13,177 --> 00:12:16,374
You want me to quit my job so
you can feel like you have a girlfriend?

187
00:12:16,547 --> 00:12:20,313
No, but it would be nice
if you'd realize that it's just a job.

188
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:24,812
-Just a job?
-Yes.

189
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:29,016
Do you realize this is the first time in my
life l'm doing something l care about?

190
00:12:29,193 --> 00:12:32,287
This is the first time l'm doing
something l'm actually good at?

191
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:34,053
l mean, if you don't get that--

192
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:36,700
l get that. l get that big-time,
and l'm happy for you.

193
00:12:36,868 --> 00:12:39,666
l'm tired of having a relationship
with your answering machine.

194
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:42,829
-l don't know what to do anymore.
-Well, neither do l!

195
00:12:44,642 --> 00:12:46,041
ls this about Mark?

196
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:49,809
-Oh, my God!
-Okay, it's not.

197
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:55,886
Oh, my God! l cannot keep having this
same fight over and over again, Ross.

198
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:58,648
-You're making this too hard.
-l'm making this too hard?

199
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:02,554
-Okay, what do you want me to do?
-l don't know. l don't know. Look...

200
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:04,217
...maybe we should take a break.

201
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:08,832
Okay. Okay, fine. You're right.
Let's take a break. Let's cool off. Okay.

202
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,163
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.

203
00:13:13,604 --> 00:13:14,593
No.

204
00:13:17,775 --> 00:13:19,800
A break from us.

205
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:35,486
And the advances in collating
in the past five years....

206
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,753
l mean, we just got
in an X-5000, you know?

207
00:13:37,962 --> 00:13:41,261
The X-5000 makes an X-50
look like a T-7 1 .

208
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:46,728
Hey, it's the dinosaur guy!

209
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:49,903
-Hi, Ross!
-Hi, Chloe.

210
00:13:50,074 --> 00:13:52,804
l want you to meet
some friends of mine.

211
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:55,944
This guy's my hero.

212
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:58,344
He comes in with stuff,
he wants it blown up 400% .

213
00:13:58,516 --> 00:14:00,677
We say, ''We don't do that.''
He says, ''You gotta.''

214
00:14:00,852 --> 00:14:03,082
And you know what?
We did it.

215
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:07,088
And now anytime anybody wants
400, we just say, ''Let's Ross it!''

216
00:14:07,258 --> 00:14:10,056
And that's the only color
that comes in.

217
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:14,721
Yo, Chloe. Do you have a quarter
for the condom machine?

218
00:14:18,336 --> 00:14:21,772
What are you doing here? l thought
tonight was your big anniversary dinner.

219
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:26,569
Yeah, a little change of plans.
We're gonna break up instead.

220
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,005
And l can also speak a little French.

221
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:34,045
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?

222
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,510
Why? What did l say?

223
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:41,485
Well, you just asked if l wanted
to go to bed with you tonight.

224
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:44,856
Oh, my God.

225
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:48,829
No wonder l get such
great service at Cafê Maurice.

226
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:50,498
Knock, knock, knock, knock.

227
00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:55,638
Hi. Could you please tell Sergei
that l was fascinated...

228
00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:58,674
...by what Boutros Boutros-Ghali
said in the New York Times.

229
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,441
You didn't say
''Boutros Boutros-Ghali.''

230
00:15:05,183 --> 00:15:07,413
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

231
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:10,911
He says he was too.

232
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:13,113
lnteresting.

233
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:16,453
So l was wondering--

234
00:15:16,627 --> 00:15:19,391
Before you get all talky again...

235
00:15:19,564 --> 00:15:22,055
...could you also please
tell Sergei...

236
00:15:23,534 --> 00:15:26,002
...that l really like his suit.

237
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,246
He said, ''Thank you.''
He thinks you look pretty tonight.

238
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,048
''Your hair, golden like the sun.''
So you're a chef?

239
00:15:46,757 --> 00:15:49,021
l'm also thinking of opening up
my own restaurant.

240
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,718
-Really?
-Could l talk to you behind my menu?

241
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:59,100
-What are you doing?
-Well, l was having a conversation.

242
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,602
Mischa is so interested in you
that Sergei and l...

243
00:16:01,772 --> 00:16:03,933
...haven't been able to say two words
to each other.

244
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:07,710
Do you want me to sit here silently
while you three converse?

245
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,574
That would be great.
Thank you.

246
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:20,016
-Hello?
-Hi. lt's Mark.

247
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:24,060
-What? ls it my breath?
-No.

248
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:27,364
Sorry. l just thought
you were somebody else. Hi.

249
00:16:27,532 --> 00:16:30,228
Hi. Look, l was just
gonna leave a message.

250
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:32,232
lsn't tonight your anniversary dinner?

251
00:16:32,403 --> 00:16:34,268
Well....

252
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:39,800
-Rach? Are you okay?
-Yeah, l'm fine.

253
00:16:40,111 --> 00:16:41,942
You wanna talk?
I can come over.

254
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:44,707
No. Really, no. Please. That's okay.

255
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:47,349
All right. l'm coming,
and l'll bring Chinese food.

256
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:49,042
Oh, yeah, l'm not hungry.

257
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,711
It's for me.

258
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,315
Okay, bye.

259
00:16:57,728 --> 00:16:59,696
-So, what are you gonna do?
-What can l do?

260
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:01,991
One person wants to break up,
you break up.

261
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:05,600
No way. Come on. This is you guys.
Call her and work it out.

262
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:09,363
Come on. We just had this huge fight.
Don't l have to wait a while?

263
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,670
Hey, this isn't like swimming
after you eat. Pick up the phone!

264
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,783
You know that whole
swimming thing is a myth.

265
00:17:20,985 --> 00:17:23,249
Yeah. Tell that to my uncle Lenny.

266
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:25,651
Why? What happened to him?

267
00:17:25,823 --> 00:17:28,883
Nothing. He just really
believes in that.

268
00:17:30,661 --> 00:17:33,687
And then we got into this
big, stupid fight.... lt was awful.

269
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:38,994
l told him he treats me like
a park ranger, something....

270
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:40,765
And then...

271
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:44,339
...l told him
l wanted to take a break.

272
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:47,442
l don't want to take a break.

273
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:49,136
l'm sorry.

274
00:17:50,181 --> 00:17:53,446
-Egg roll?
-No.

275
00:17:54,018 --> 00:17:57,146
And then l called him,
and he wasn't there.

276
00:17:57,321 --> 00:17:58,948
Well, he's probably just out.

277
00:17:59,123 --> 00:18:02,388
Well, thank you, that's very helpful.
l'm glad you came over.

278
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:09,325
Hi, it's me.

279
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:13,192
-Hi. l'm so glad you called.
-Really?

280
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:16,704
l've been thinking this is crazy.
Don't you think we can work on this?

281
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:19,400
Hey, what do you wanna drink?

282
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:20,733
Who's that?

283
00:18:22,246 --> 00:18:23,975
Nobody?

284
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:27,042
ls it okay if l finish
the apple juice?

285
00:18:27,585 --> 00:18:28,779
ls that Mark?

286
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:33,987
-Honey, look, he just came over--
-Yeah, got it!

287
00:18:38,562 --> 00:18:41,622
Hey, dinosaur guy.
Look at you, so sad.

288
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:44,893
-Come dance.
-That's okay. Thanks.

289
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,237
You don't have to smile.
You just have to dance.

290
00:18:49,407 --> 00:18:52,205
l don't feel like dancing.
l feel like having a drink, okay?

291
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:55,277
Okay. Hey, two beers.

292
00:18:57,181 --> 00:19:00,082
Okay, now we're
just dancing with each other.

293
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:09,886
And the vet said it was time.

294
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:12,118
And so from half a world away...

295
00:19:12,396 --> 00:19:15,058
...while my mother
held the phone to his ear...

296
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:18,393
...l said goodbye to my dog...

297
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:20,928
...in seven languages.

298
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,170
-Could l have a tissue?
-Yeah, sure.

299
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:27,242
l just hope you don't accidentally...

300
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:30,312
...suck it up through your nose
and choke on it.

301
00:19:35,953 --> 00:19:39,980
Sergei would like to apologize
for my behavior tonight.

302
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:43,720
Well, tell him, ''Apology accepted.''

303
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,658
He's unbelievable.

304
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:50,960
For the first time in three years,
someone wants to talk to me.

305
00:19:51,135 --> 00:19:54,935
But do you think he would
let me enjoy that? No!

306
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:58,834
You silly diplomat. Why don't you
learn some English, Sergei.

307
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:04,508
Excuse me, but isn't he paying
for your dinner?

308
00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:06,673
Hey, the man's dog just died.

309
00:20:24,602 --> 00:20:26,627
l have just resigned my post.

310
00:20:26,837 --> 00:20:29,465
Would you care to accompany
me to the Rainbow Room?

311
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,403
l have diplomatic coupons.

312
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:36,042
lt would be my pleasure.

313
00:20:36,714 --> 00:20:39,046
My guy has coupons.

314
00:20:40,684 --> 00:20:43,346
Your guy can't even say ''coupons.''

315
00:20:50,694 --> 00:20:54,357
-Plate.
-Plate! Yes! Plate!

316
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:56,663
Plate.

317
00:20:57,835 --> 00:21:00,133
See, we don't need them.

318
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:05,706
-Plate?
-Yeah.

319
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:16,751
l like this song.

320
00:21:17,188 --> 00:21:19,748
Well, you're practically
dancing already.

321
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:23,952
-Why don't you just do it over here?
-No.

322
00:21:24,128 --> 00:21:26,323
What, are you married?

323
00:21:26,497 --> 00:21:28,692
Because that's okay.

324
00:21:43,247 --> 00:21:46,080
Be home, be home, be home,
be home, be home, be home.

325
00:21:47,952 --> 00:21:49,977
Be home, be home, be home.

326
00:21:52,556 --> 00:21:54,683
You're not home.

327
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:06,432
Still no smile?

328
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:45,270
American.

329
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:50,436
You know, it's a very hard language.

330
00:22:51,348 --> 00:22:52,610
Let's do it again.

331
00:23:00,257 --> 00:23:01,246
[ENGLlSH]
