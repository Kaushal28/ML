1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:05,901
I can't believe
my little brother's married!

2
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:11,267
Why didn't you tell me
you were eloping?

3
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:14,208
Well, we were at court,
eating lunch

4
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,075
Why were you at the courthouse?

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,843
We were having lunch.

6
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:20,780
We were like...

7
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:25,218
...we're here, we're having lunch.
Let's get married! Right?

8
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:29,759
A year ago, I didn't know I had
a brother. Now I have a sister!

9
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,863
Oh, it's so great.

10
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,528
Okay.

11
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,697
Okay.

12
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,306
Stop it! Don't!

13
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,939
I'll get you a gift now.

14
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,206
Is there anything you need?

15
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:57,712
We've been trying to get pregnant since
we got engaged, to get a jump on things.

16
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,717
No one's getting any younger.

17
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:06,724
Because the thing is, we're not
able to, you know, conceive.

18
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,163
We've seen a bunch of doctors.

19
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,496
They say that our only chance
to have a baby...

20
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:17,836
...is that if they take my sperm,
her egg, put it together in a dish...

21
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,079
...and put it into another girl.

22
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:24,010
We were wondering
if you could be that girl.

23
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,981
That's a really nice gift.

24
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,492
I was thinking of a gravy boat.

25
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,926
We know it's a lot to ask.

26
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,159
We don't have anyone else to go to.
We could pay someone...

27
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,099
...but we don't have
that kind of money.

28
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:47,001
Plus, you know, you're
family and, you know...

29
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,476
...I just don't want my baby to grow into
some chick I don't know, you know?

30
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,612
Don't give us an answer yet,
think about it.

31
00:01:55,748 --> 00:02:01,084
And if you say no,
we'll totally understand.

32
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:05,050
Okay. Okay.

33
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:11,196
And we were wondering if you could
give us a ride down to the train station.

34
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:17,292
Well, actually, we kind of need
an answer to that one right now.

35
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,369
The One with Phoebe's Uterus

36
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,584
Check it out!
Guess what job I just got.

37
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,322
I don't know, but Donald Trump
wants his blue blazer black.

38
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:18,586
What?

39
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,532
Blue blazer back.
He wants it back.

40
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:27,369
You said "black." Why would he
want his blue blazer black?

41
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,871
Well, you know what I meant.

42
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,542
You messed it up.

43
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,012
You're stupid.

44
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,614
So, what job did you get?

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,884
Tour guide at the museum.
Ross got it for me.

46
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:47,320
Don't you have to be
a dinosaur expert?

47
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,859
They give you
all the information.

48
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,495
It's like memorizing a script.

49
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:57,102
On your left you have a tyrannosaurus rex,
from the Jurassic Period.

50
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,064
Very nice.

51
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:02,866
Yeah, actually, Joey,
it's the Cretaceous Period.

52
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,809
But I can pronounce Jurassic.

53
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,881
Frank Jr. and Alice got married!

54
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:13,918
Oh, my God!

55
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,586
They're having a baby!

56
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,754
They want me to grow it
for them in my uterus!

57
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,556
-My God!
-Are you serious?

58
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,392
You're thinking of
having sex with your brother?

59
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,032
Ew! And, oh, no!

60
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,570
They want me to be the surrogate.

61
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,875
It's her egg and his sperm.
I'm the oven. It's their bun.

62
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:46,882
What did you say?

63
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:51,045
I had to think about it first,
but what is there to think of?

64
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:54,590
I'll be giving someone
the greatest gift.

65
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:59,025
You'll carry their child
and get them a Sony PlayStation?

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,034
This is an incredible thing to do.

67
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,931
But there are things to think about.

68
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:09,505
Yeah, you'd be pregnant.
I mean, pregnant.

69
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,701
I know.

70
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:15,871
You'll put your body
through an awful lot.

71
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,380
I mean, morning sickness, labor.

72
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,244
It's all for somebody else.

73
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,319
Yeah. What's your point?

74
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,956
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.

75
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,458
I couldn't do that.

76
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,462
I always figured the first time I had a baby,
it'd be with someone I love.

77
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,362
And that baby was, you know...

78
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,126
...a keeper.

79
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:43,365
You were more supportive when
I wanted to make denim furniture.

80
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:47,410
If you decide to do this,
we'll be supportive like crazy.

81
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,080
Just think it through.

82
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:52,478
Talk to somebody who's had a baby.
Like your mom.

83
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:57,588
My mom never gave birth.
Oh! But my birth mom did!

84
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,923
I love this tushy!
Can I take it to work with me?

85
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:12,327
Yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway.
It came with the pants.

86
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,943
I am so jealous.

87
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,705
You guys are just right there.

88
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,748
Yes.

89
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,510
Right where?

90
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:30,588
The beginning, where
it's all sex and talking...

91
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,417
...and sex and talking.

92
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,754
You got to love the talking.

93
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,864
-And the sex?
-We haven't had sex.

94
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,365
What's the big deal?
This is special.

95
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:47,369
I want our love to grow
before moving to the next level.

96
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,035
Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.

97
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,040
That is really nice...

98
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,712
...Iying!

99
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,877
-No way is that the reason.
-Why?

100
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,076
Because you're not mature enough
to understand that?

101
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,380
He's right. I'm totally lying.

102
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,689
Then what is it?

103
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,955
Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.

104
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:17,529
And you're afraid you won't
be able to fill his shoes?

105
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,769
I'm afraid I won't
make love as well as him.

106
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:27,603
-I was going for the metaphor.
-I was saying the actual words.

107
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,783
He's had a lot of girlfriends.
Doesn't mean he's great in bed.

108
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,819
We share a wall.

109
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:41,425
Either he's great, or she liked
to agree with him a lot.

110
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,830
Loudly and a lot.

111
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,935
All night long she'd agree.

112
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,334
It'll be different. The sex will be
great because you're in love.

113
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,670
-Just go for it.
-Yeah, you should.

114
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,847
All right. I'll sleep
with my girlfriend.

115
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,383
But I'm just doing it for you guys.

116
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,257
Now, the mastodon is from
the semi-late Jurassic Period.

117
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,254
Isn't the mastodon
from the Pliocene Epoch?

118
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,362
This is a museum. No talking.

119
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,895
Right down here we have...

120
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,163
...a large foot.

121
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,672
And over here we have Ross Geller.

122
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,007
Everyone wave "hi" to Ross.

123
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,447
Ross is one of our scientists.
Look at him hard at work.

124
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,488
Okay, moving right along.

125
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,059
Come on.

126
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,693
It's open. Come in.

127
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,827
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-That's okay.

128
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,629
I had time to finish
glazing my nipples.

129
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,901
You go all out
when you're expecting company.

130
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,606
I was working on my pottery.

131
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,851
Oh! I didn't know
that you did pot.

132
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:21,155
Mostly nudes. It combines
my two passions: pottery and erotica.

133
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,294
Erottery!

134
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,666
Thanks for coming out to see me.

135
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:32,894
I thought it'd be a good idea to
talk about this baby stuff in person.

136
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,365
I don't think it's a good idea.

137
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,075
Why not?

138
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,579
You'd be giving up a baby.

139
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,576
And I really don't

140
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,840
I don't know if anything I said...

141
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,953
...would make you understand the pain
of giving up a baby.

142
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,694
No, no, I understand the pain.
Don't hurt the puppy!

143
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,095
No, no. The puppy is yours.

144
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:05,561
-I get a puppy?
-But for only three days.

145
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,200
Why?

146
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:14,706
I realize I don't have any right
to start getting parent-y on you now.

147
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:24,152
Look at me and not the puppy.
It's very important.

148
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,321
I know what I'm talking about.

149
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,385
I gave up two babies.

150
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:35,396
I only wish I had someone
who'd given up babies that told me...

151
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,533
...how terrible it is.

152
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,672
I really shouldn't have
given you the puppy first.

153
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,038
That's okay.
No, we're listening.

154
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:53,042
It'd be something you'd regret
every day for the rest of your life.

155
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,515
So however hard it is for you
to give up this puppy...

156
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:04,190
...it'd be a million times harder
to give up a child.

157
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,832
Okay, fair enough. Three days.

158
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:14,333
Oh, it's time to take
my ass out of the kiln.

159
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:23,140
Could you sit there? I'm saving
this seat for my friend Ross.

160
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:24,646
You mean Dr. Geller?

161
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:28,044
Doctor? I didn't know
he had a nickname.

162
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,151
Oh, he won't sit here.

163
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,516
Only people in white coats
sit there.

164
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:36,693
Only people in blue blazers
sit here.

165
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,090
-How come?
-That's just the way it is.

166
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,163
That's crazy.

167
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:47,701
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world:
a world without lab coats and blazers.

168
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,272
But you not in a perfect world.
You in a museum now.

169
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,078
See that scientist?

170
00:11:55,715 --> 00:12:00,243
He and I used to play together
in grade school, but now....

171
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,749
Peter! Hey, Peter!

172
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,993
It's me! Rhonda, from P.S. 129?

173
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,456
I shared my pudding with you, man!

174
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,662
I gave you my Snack Pack!

175
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,836
See? He pretend
he don't even hear me!

176
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,937
Everyone's pretending
they don't hear you.

177
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:30,312
I don't know about your jackets
and separate tables...

178
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,006
...but Ross is my friend.

179
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:36,448
And if I save him a seat,
he will sit in it.

180
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,787
Here! I saved you a seat!

181
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,491
I'm cool here.
I'll catch up with you later.

182
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,536
This is saved.

183
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,937
Gift shop.

184
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:10,616
I'm really, really sorry about what
happened in the cafeteria today.

185
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,118
You do what you got to do.

186
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:18,695
The scientists and the tour guides
never sit together.

187
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,588
Whatever.

188
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,600
It's like that everywhere.
Mon, back me up.

189
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,967
Where you work, the waiters
eat with the waiters.

190
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,699
And the chefs eat
with the other chefs?

191
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:35,343
I eat by myself in the alley,
because everybody hates me.

192
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:40,608
Okay, Rach, when was the last time
you had lunch with the shipping clerks?

193
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:43,277
I've never had lunch
with the shipping clerks...

194
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:48,052
...but it's totally different. They're not
allowed in the executive cafeteria.

195
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,822
Oh, I see what you're saying.

196
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,893
Look, Ross.

197
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,694
It's no big deal.

198
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,201
You wear a white coat.
I wear a blue blazer.

199
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,896
If that means we can't be
friends at work, so be it.

200
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,904
I understand, you know?

201
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:08,975
When I'm in a play and you're in
the audience, I don't talk to you.

202
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,247
So it's, you know, it's cool.

203
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:13,951
I'll see you tomorrow.

204
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:21,024
When we're in the audience,
he doesn't talk but he does wave.

205
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:31,197
Who's my puppy? Who's my puppy?
Who's my puppy?

206
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:35,398
-Have you named him yet?
-No, I don't want to get attached.

207
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,601
-Can I hold him?
-Sure. Here.

208
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:42,474
-Come here, squirmy. Hello
-Not like that. No.

209
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,781
Why's Phoebe singing
to Karl Malden?

210
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,621
I think it's time for puppy
to go out again.

211
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,092
Come on, let's go to the balcony.

212
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,758
The street.
Come on, let's go to the street.

213
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,406
Don't go on the balcony
until after I get back.

214
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,368
So did you do it?

215
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,077
Yes, yes, we had the sex.

216
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,305
It was bad?

217
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:22,453
It was fine, but she didn't agree
with me as strongly as with Joey.

218
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,953
She was like, "l see your point.
I'm all right with it."

219
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:33,425
There's not always a lot of agreement
the first time.

220
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:37,566
Yeah. Not for girls, anyway.
Guys agree like that.

221
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,597
Look, you have to help me.

222
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:41,999
I mean....

223
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:46,735
I know what to do with a woman.
It's always nice.

224
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,274
I need to know...

225
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,471
...what makes it go from nice to:

226
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,582
"My God! Somebody's killing her
in there!"

227
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,751
I'll show you something
a lot of guys don't know.

228
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,753
All right.

229
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,255
Now.

230
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:06,328
You don't have to draw an actual
Whoa, she's hot!

231
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,130
Everyone knows the erogenous zones.

232
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,859
You got one, two, three...

233
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:13,933
...four...

234
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,302
...five, six and seven.

235
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,266
There are seven?

236
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,771
Let me see that.

237
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,475
Oh, yeah.

238
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,675
That's one?

239
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,716
Kind of an important one.

240
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,780
I was looking at it upside down.

241
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,228
Well, you know, sometimes that helps.

242
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:48,204
Most guys will hit one, two, three
and then go to seven and set up camp.

243
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,567
That's bad?

244
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:55,813
At Disneyland, you don't spend
the whole day on the Matterhorn.

245
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,479
You might if it were like seven.

246
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:04,555
All right, the important thing
is to take your time.

247
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,484
You want to hit them all...

248
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,024
...mix them up.
Keep them on their toes.

249
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,492
Oh, toes!

250
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,260
For some people.

251
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,561
All right.

252
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:24,231
You could start out
with a little one.

253
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,772
A two.

254
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,342
A one, two, three.

255
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,204
A three.

256
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,713
A five.

257
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:33,673
A four.

258
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,584
A three, two.

259
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,845
Two. A two, four, six.

260
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,552
Two, four, six.

261
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,420
Four. Two.

262
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:46,397
Two. Four, seven!

263
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,023
Five, seven! Six, seven!

264
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,634
Seven! Seven!

265
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,362
Seven! Seven! Seven! Seven!
Seven! Seven!

266
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,407
Seven!

267
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,841
And there you are.

268
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,052
Yeah, that'll work.

269
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,469
Dr. Geller?
There's a seat here.

270
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,901
Thank you, Dr. Phillips.

271
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,701
But I'm having my lunch...

272
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:37,175
...at this table.
Here in the middle.

273
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,349
I'm having my lunch...

274
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:43,386
...right here
with my good friend, Joey.

275
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,556
If he'll sit with me.

276
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,198
I will sit with you, Dr. Geller.

277
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,429
You know...

278
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:03,141
...we work in a museum
of natural history.

279
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,935
And yet, there is something...

280
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,669
...unnatural...

281
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,610
...about the way we eat lunch.

282
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,180
Now, I want you to know...

283
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:19,416
...it took a tour guide to show
this scientist the error of his ways.

284
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:23,422
You might even say he took
me on a tour...

285
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,025
...of myself.

286
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,027
Yeah, that was me.

287
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,901
I look around, and you know what I see?
I see division.

288
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:40,101
Division between people in white coats
and people in blue blazers.

289
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,574
I ask myself, "My God, why?"

290
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,852
Now, I say we shed these coats...

291
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,747
...that separate us.

292
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,952
And we get to know
the people underneath.

293
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,254
I'm Ross!

294
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,798
I'm divorced and I have a kid!

295
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,373
I'm Joey! I'm an actor!

296
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,873
I don't know squat about dinosaurs!

297
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:21,546
I'm Ted, and I just moved here,
and New York really scares me.

298
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,722
-There you go!
-Hang in there, Teddy!

299
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,424
I'm Andrew.

300
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,393
And I didn't pay for this pear.

301
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,328
Okay. Good for you.

302
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:39,399
I'm Rhonda!
And these aren't real!

303
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,538
Wow, Rhonda.

304
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,241
-I'm Scott.
-Yeah, okay, Scott!

305
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:54,747
I flip the light switch on and off
17 times when I leave a room...

306
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,184
...or my family will die.

307
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,053
My mom's gonna be here any minute.

308
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,627
I can't. I can't give him up.

309
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,460
Yes, no. I can.

310
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,295
I don't want to.

311
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,401
But I can.

312
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,865
No.

313
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,474
I can't watch this.
It's like Sophie's Choice.

314
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,769
You know, I never saw that.

315
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,107
Oh, it was only okay.

316
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,247
I can't do this.

317
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:31,615
My mom was right.
If I can't give him up...

318
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,120
...there's no way
I can give up a baby.

319
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:38,390
Frank and Alice
are going to be so crushed.

320
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:42,226
What else can I give them?
A kidney!

321
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,303
We were in the neighborhood.

322
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:52,668
We want to let you know that
there's still no pressure.

323
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:58,583
If there was something you wanted
to say, we'll be right there.

324
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,343
Who's this little guy?

325
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,760
He's so cute! He reminds me
of my old dog, Tumor.

326
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:16,260
You are so precious,
I could take you home.

327
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:17,892
Why don't you?

328
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,969
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

329
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,108
Thanks.

330
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,045
-What are you doing?
-I'm okay with this.

331
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,712
You know why?
Because look at them.

332
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,713
Look how happy they are.

333
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,886
And I made that, so you know....

334
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:43,351
It'll be a million times harder
to give up a baby, but oh, my God!

335
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:46,358
It'll feel a million times
better, right?

336
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,729
I'll do this.
I want to carry your baby.

337
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,402
Thank you so much!

338
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,410
You don't know what this means to us.

339
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,307
I think I'm going to cry!

340
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,689
It's going to be so great.

341
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,422
-What's going on?
-I gave them the puppy.

342
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:21,564
It made them so happy,
I decided to carry their baby.

343
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,100
-Phoebe
-No, I know.

344
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,997
We're different, though.

345
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,502
This is a different situation.

346
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,174
I am not going to regret this.

347
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,235
I understand all that.

348
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:38,208
It's just, that was my puppy.

349
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,250
Would you ever be a surrogate?

350
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,053
Depends who asked.

351
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,986
What if I asked?

352
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,721
Oh, Mon, sure!

353
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,260
-Really?
-Yes.

354
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,902
You're not asking me, are you?

355
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,528
-No.
-Yes. Totally.

356
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,372
Thank you! Thank you!

357
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,006
Thank you!
Yes, thank you!
