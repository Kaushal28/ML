1
00:00:05,284 --> 00:00:06,546
-Hey.
-Hi.

2
00:00:06,785 --> 00:00:10,915
-What are you doing?
-I was thinking of moving the couch.

3
00:00:11,156 --> 00:00:12,521
Why wouId you want to do that?

4
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:15,158
So there'd be a decent pIace
for me to sit?

5
00:00:16,562 --> 00:00:20,692
-Rach, there is a decent pIace.
-And your Iap does not count.

6
00:00:22,568 --> 00:00:25,230
-Come on, heIp me move this.
-No, no, no.

7
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:26,797
-No?
-No.

8
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:28,700
Rosita does not move.

9
00:00:31,577 --> 00:00:34,205
I'm sorry. Rosita? As in--?

10
00:00:34,413 --> 00:00:36,745
As in ''Rosita does not move.''

11
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:39,108
It's just a chair.
What's the big deaI?

12
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:42,809
It's the e<i>x</i>act e<i>q</i>uaI distance
from the bathroom to the kitchen...

13
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:48,118
...and it's at an angIe where you
don't get any gIare coming off Stevie.

14
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:50,590
Stevie the TV?

15
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:54,865
-Is there a probIem?
-No.

16
00:00:58,203 --> 00:00:59,431
What does he know?

17
00:00:59,705 --> 00:01:02,868
Come on, Rosita.
Us <i>chicas</i> gotta stick together.

18
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:14,051
You bitch!

19
00:01:15,954 --> 00:01:18,115
The One Where Rosita Dies

20
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,886
Hey, you know what's weird?

21
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:58,894
After you guys get married,
when you introduce me to peopIe...

22
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:02,556
...you're gonna have to say,
''This is my brother-in-Iaw, Ross.''

23
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:06,135
Not ''my friend, Ross,''
''brother-in-Iaw, Ross.''

24
00:02:06,304 --> 00:02:07,498
That's weird, isn't it?

25
00:02:07,773 --> 00:02:09,968
CouIdn't I just say,
''This is Ross''?

26
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:12,270
Sure, do whatever you want.

27
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,669
Hey, Ross?

28
00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:18,348
I checked the reaI estate section.

29
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:20,311
Look at this.

30
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:22,248
Looks Iike Mom and Dad's house.

31
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:25,888
Even has a tree
with a broken Iimb out front.

32
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:29,958
And the window in the attic....

33
00:02:30,228 --> 00:02:32,423
Oh, my God!

34
00:02:32,898 --> 00:02:35,890
What happened
to the window in the attic?

35
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:40,560
-I can't beIieve they're seIIing it.
-And they didn't teII us.

36
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:43,366
What happened
to the window in the attic?

37
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,004
HeIIo, Dad? Monica and I just saw
the house in the paper.

38
00:02:50,716 --> 00:02:53,184
Yes, we're surprised.

39
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:56,520
Who did you Ieave a message with?

40
00:02:56,955 --> 00:02:58,855
Sorry!

41
00:03:02,194 --> 00:03:04,025
Joey, Joey, I'm so sorry.

42
00:03:04,196 --> 00:03:07,563
I toId you not to move it!
How wouId you feeI if, say...

43
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:10,167
...I wanted to move your mom, okay...

44
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:12,496
...and you said, ''Don't,''
and I did it anyway...

45
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:14,639
...and her head feII off?

46
00:03:16,074 --> 00:03:17,939
I'II buy you a new one, okay?

47
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:21,612
We'II go to the store and get you
a new chair right now.

48
00:03:25,717 --> 00:03:28,345
She's not even coId yet.

49
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:33,149
WouIdn't Rosita have
wanted you to move on?

50
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:37,851
I mean, you know, she did aIways
put your comfort first.

51
00:03:40,065 --> 00:03:41,498
That's true.

52
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:46,634
-Okay, you ready?
-Yeah.

53
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:50,338
I don't want Stevie to see her Iike this.

54
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:57,779
I can't beIieve we have to say goodbye
to the house we grew up in.

55
00:03:57,983 --> 00:04:00,884
Man, some stranger's gonna be
in my room.

56
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:03,986
For 1 5 years they kept it
as a shrine to you.

57
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:06,713
It's time the veIvet ropes came down.

58
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:09,416
They kept your room a whiIe.

59
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:14,224
PIease! Dad turned my room into
a gym 20 minutes after I moved out.

60
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:18,596
I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack
of Victoria's Secret cataIogs?

61
00:04:18,804 --> 00:04:20,169
Not a gym.

62
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:24,430
-Come on. You know they Iove you.
-As much as they Iove you?

63
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:28,739
They thought she was barren
untiI I was born. It's not my fauIt.

64
00:04:33,552 --> 00:04:35,349
I hate this year.

65
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:37,215
What's wrong with this year?

66
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:40,720
It's February and I've onIy
given two massages...

67
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,291
...and they were both horribIe tippers.

68
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:45,393
That was me and Ross.

69
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:49,627
Oh, that's right.

70
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:51,769
If you want some e<i>x</i>tra cash...

71
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:55,564
...some coIIege friends made
good money doing teIemarketing.

72
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,868
That's a great idea.
You're reaIIy good on the phone.

73
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:01,911
It'd be better than the Iast
teIephone job I had.

74
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,047
I probabIy won't have to say
''spank'' as much.

75
00:05:09,254 --> 00:05:10,619
What?

76
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:13,851
Oh, yeah, Iike you never caIIed.

77
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:23,467
This is very easy.
You read from the script...

78
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:26,330
...and try to seII as much
toner as you can.

79
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:28,199
Okay, I can do that.

80
00:05:28,473 --> 00:05:31,772
By the way, I Iove my office.

81
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,070
-Why don't we do a triaI run?
-Oh, okay.

82
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:38,646
AII right.

83
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:41,780
Hi, this is Phoebe
from Empire Office SuppIies.

84
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,013
-Can I speak to your suppIy manager?
-I'm the suppIy manager.

85
00:05:46,324 --> 00:05:48,485
I'd Iike to taIk
about your toner needs.

86
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,684
We don't need any.

87
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:51,988
Okay, sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.

88
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:54,429
Yeah, you're right. This is easy.

89
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:57,668
Okay. What was wrong with that caII?

90
00:05:57,869 --> 00:05:59,234
Oh, weII, aII right.

91
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:02,905
No offense,
but you were kind of rude.

92
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:07,310
They aIways say they
don't need toner. That's okay.

93
00:06:07,545 --> 00:06:12,073
Whatever they say, you can find the
answer to it, here in the script.

94
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:14,818
So I think you're ready to seII toner.

95
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,079
-Do you have any Iast <i>q</i>uestions?
-No.

96
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:19,619
Wait, yes, I do have one <i>q</i>uestion:

97
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:21,415
What is toner?

98
00:06:24,562 --> 00:06:26,052
Joey?

99
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:29,194
Joe?

100
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:35,435
FuII bag?

101
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:39,407
Beer's stiII coId.

102
00:06:41,146 --> 00:06:44,240
Something terribIe
must have happened here.

103
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:54,558
Oh, no, no, no!

104
00:06:57,395 --> 00:07:00,057
Stevie, I was never here.

105
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:07,496
-Dad?
-I'm here!

106
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:09,663
-Hey.
-Hi.

107
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:14,174
Seems Iike just yesterday you guys
used to come out to watch me work.

108
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:16,779
We can't beIieve
you're seIIing the house.

109
00:07:16,982 --> 00:07:18,847
Time for a new famiIy
to start here.

110
00:07:19,117 --> 00:07:22,314
I hope their check cIears before
they find the crack...

111
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,353
...in the foundation
and the asbestos in the ceiIing.

112
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:30,159
Let's grab our stuff and
get the heII out of here.

113
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:34,131
-Sorry we can't store your things.
-Oh, it's okay.

114
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,527
I can't wait to see everything again.

115
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:38,701
I don't know what's down here.

116
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:42,634
But there are si<i>x</i> or seven
Easy-Bake Ovens in the attic.

117
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:45,666
I used to Iove to pIay restaurant.

118
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:48,971
Not as much as you Ioved to pIay
''uncooked batter eater.''

119
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:54,581
You can't e<i>x</i>pect a chiId to wait
for a Iight buIb to cook brownies.

120
00:07:56,287 --> 00:07:58,812
So I think your bo<i>x</i>es are over here.

121
00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:00,423
Oh, great.

122
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:02,353
Hey...

123
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,585
...whose cigarettes are these?

124
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:08,723
I don't know.

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,366
They must be your mother's.

126
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:16,336
But pIease, pIease don't ask her.
I'II throw these away.

127
00:08:20,311 --> 00:08:23,678
CooI! Dad, my report cards!

128
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:25,314
Hey, check this out.

129
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:30,716
Math, ''A.'' Science, ''A.''
History, ''A.'' Gym....

130
00:08:36,728 --> 00:08:39,526
My rock poIisher!

131
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:42,923
Oh, Iook, there's your oId makeup kit.

132
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:48,929
It's a cIown kit. CIown kit!

133
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:52,235
But the white seems to be untouched.

134
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,475
-Uh-oh.
-What?

135
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:02,915
You know how the garage
fIoods every spring?

136
00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:06,248
How are you ever gonna seII
this pIace?

137
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,821
I think I accidentaIIy
used Monica's bo<i>x</i>es...

138
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:12,495
...to keep the water away
from the Porsche.

139
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,465
Oh, no, Dad. Dad?

140
00:09:18,636 --> 00:09:19,625
What the--

141
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:24,205
Oh, God.
Everything's ruined!

142
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:26,671
Dad, she's gonna be crushed.

143
00:09:28,546 --> 00:09:30,673
You don't secretIy smoke, do you?

144
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:33,950
No.

145
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:36,483
So it's just your mother then.

146
00:09:46,598 --> 00:09:49,999
Hi. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office SuppIies.

147
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:53,136
Can I speak to your
suppIy manager, pIease?

148
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:56,173
EarI. Thanks.

149
00:09:56,908 --> 00:10:00,901
Hi, EarI. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office SuppIies.

150
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:03,706
I'd Iike to taIk to you
about your toner needs.

151
00:10:04,115 --> 00:10:06,447
I don't need any toner.

152
00:10:07,652 --> 00:10:12,282
I hear what you're saying, but at
our prices, everyone needs toner.

153
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,118
Not me.

154
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,223
May I ask why?

155
00:10:17,462 --> 00:10:19,987
You want to know why?

156
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:22,029
You want to know why?

157
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:24,167
I sureIy do.

158
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:25,860
<i>Okay.</i>

159
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:29,200
I don't need any toner...

160
00:10:29,474 --> 00:10:31,499
...because I'm gonna kiII myseIf.

161
00:10:44,222 --> 00:10:46,884
Is that because you're out of toner?

162
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:52,225
Okay, so no toner today.
Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.

163
00:10:52,397 --> 00:10:56,891
Wait, wait! I can't Iet you hang up.
Just pIease taIk to me.

164
00:10:57,335 --> 00:10:58,563
WeII....

165
00:10:59,837 --> 00:11:01,771
I onIy had one thing to do today.

166
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:07,740
I guess I couId push it back.

167
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:10,909
Yeah. Now, why do you
want to kiII yourseIf?

168
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,542
I've been working for 1 0 years
now at this...

169
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:17,812
...meaningIess, dead-end job...

170
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,149
...and nobody here
even knows that I e<i>x</i>ist.

171
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:23,851
ChandIer?

172
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:30,491
I'm sorry?

173
00:11:32,103 --> 00:11:33,468
Look...

174
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:36,196
...I'm sure that peopIe know
you e<i>x</i>ist.

175
00:11:36,474 --> 00:11:38,567
<i>Oh, yeah? I work in a cubicle...</i>

176
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,277
...surrounded by peopIe.

177
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:44,675
I've been taIking to you for five
minutes now about kiIIing myseIf...

178
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:48,314
...and no one's even Iooked up
from their desk. Hang on.

179
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,316
Hey, everybody...

180
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:52,011
...I'm gonna kiII myseIf.

181
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,254
I'II get back to you.

182
00:11:58,696 --> 00:11:59,993
I got nothing.

183
00:12:00,265 --> 00:12:01,357
Wait.

184
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,995
Hey, Marge.

185
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:14,071
Nothing. Nothing.

186
00:12:17,815 --> 00:12:19,476
Good chair.

187
00:12:20,084 --> 00:12:21,608
Now, if anybody asks...

188
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:24,616
...your name is Rosita.

189
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:46,866
Come on, Joey. I just bought you a new
chair, the most e<i>x</i>pensive one in the store.

190
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:50,310
You know what I was thinking?
We couId name her Francette.

191
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:52,643
Francette?

192
00:12:53,017 --> 00:12:55,247
What is she, a couch?

193
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:03,926
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.

194
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,224
Joey, the new chair
wiII be here in an hour.

195
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:11,027
Maybe we shouId move
Rosita out of here.

196
00:13:11,235 --> 00:13:13,533
Start the heaIing process.

197
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:16,232
Yeah, I guess you're right.

198
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,203
Maybe I'II take her down
to the incinerator.

199
00:13:19,544 --> 00:13:21,307
It's gonna be so sad.

200
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:22,810
And kind of cooI.

201
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:46,728
She's heaIed!

202
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:54,135
-That's weird.
-No, it's not weird.

203
00:13:54,312 --> 00:13:56,177
It's a miracIe!

204
00:13:57,348 --> 00:14:00,249
It's not a miracIe. I'm sure
there's an e<i>x</i>pIanation.

205
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:04,649
There is. If your heart is pure,
wondrous things can happen.

206
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,024
-I don't--
-Can you teII me how this happened?

207
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:13,556
-WeII, no.
-MiracIe.

208
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,796
No, you know what, maybe somebody
came in here and fi<i>x</i>ed it. Or something.

209
00:14:19,971 --> 00:14:22,599
Someone Iike an angeI?

210
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:31,610
That's right, Joey. The chair angeI
came in and heaIed your chair.

211
00:14:33,151 --> 00:14:36,177
Get your non-beIiever ass
out of my chair!

212
00:14:46,731 --> 00:14:49,393
She'II understand.
I didn't do it on purpose.

213
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,158
Dad, that won't matter to her.

214
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:53,766
Look, aII my stuff is safe and dry.

215
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:55,472
And aII her stuff is...

216
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,573
...growing new stuff.

217
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:00,509
This is the kind of thing...

218
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:03,906
...that makes her think
you Iove me more than her.

219
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:06,015
My God. Does she think that?

220
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:08,412
-Can you bIame her?
-I don't know.

221
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:12,180
We may have favored you unconsciousIy.
You were a marveI.

222
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:15,723
-The doctors said your mom couIdn't--
-I don't want to hear it.

223
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:18,555
-ReaIIy?
-WeII, not right now.

224
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:23,356
Monica came here for some memories.
Damn it, we'II give her some.

225
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:25,363
Okay, grab....

226
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,698
Grab some bo<i>x</i>es. We'II take stuff
from mine...

227
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:33,172
...and whatever we can pass off
as hers, we'II put in there.

228
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,047
-Like, this. She couId have made this.
-Sure.

229
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,706
And this, she couId have won this.

230
00:15:39,884 --> 00:15:42,045
-This couId have been hers.
-Sure.

231
00:15:42,487 --> 00:15:45,320
-Here, what about this?
-Your makeup kit?

232
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,014
I'd feeI better.

233
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,091
I am so psyched
I kept this chair for myseIf.

234
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:02,164
Yeah. Me too.

235
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,808
-Hey, how's the miracIe chair?
-Fine.

236
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:15,345
You know, this thing has
speakers in the headrest?

237
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:16,917
-No, reaIIy?
-Yeah.

238
00:16:17,154 --> 00:16:19,588
You can hook it to the TV
and you get radio.

239
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:27,256
My chair heaIs itseIf.

240
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:34,933
EarI, you're not hearing me. AII I'm saying
is, you're not aIone, aII right?

241
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:37,438
Everybody hates the peopIe
they work with.

242
00:16:43,147 --> 00:16:44,375
Hey, guy.

243
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:47,109
Wait, that sounded Iike
someone being nice to you.

244
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:50,448
No, that's just the ''hey, guy'' guy.

245
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:54,523
He says that to everybody.
He's the worst.

246
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:57,422
I'd Iike to take him with me.

247
00:16:57,828 --> 00:17:00,729
AII right. Let's just forget about
the peopIe at the office, okay?

248
00:17:00,965 --> 00:17:04,731
There's gotta be someone
worth sticking around for.

249
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:08,895
<i>What about family or friends?</i>
<i>Maybe a girlfriend?</i>

250
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,902
Yeah, right.

251
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:13,166
Oh, sorry. Boyfriend?

252
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:18,010
-Oh, God.
-<i>No, whatever. Anything.</i>

253
00:17:18,182 --> 00:17:19,479
Hey, guy.

254
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:24,285
Yeah, he's gotta go.

255
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,950
Okay, I shouId...

256
00:17:27,224 --> 00:17:29,749
...be getting back to my thing now.

257
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:31,552
See you.

258
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:34,560
I'm not finished!
Don't you dare hang up on me!

259
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:37,458
The new girI's good.

260
00:17:40,204 --> 00:17:41,637
Hey, guys.

261
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,709
I just whipped us up some Easy-Bake treats.
They shouId be ready in about three days.

262
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:49,811
That's a good one!
You hear that, Ross? Three days!

263
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:54,475
-Oh, this'II make a great memory.
-Okay.

264
00:17:54,652 --> 00:17:56,449
Which bo<i>x</i>es are mine?

265
00:17:56,654 --> 00:17:59,179
-These are yours right here.
-Okay.

266
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,448
A coIoring book.

267
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:03,349
You Ioved that thing.

268
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:06,291
You never went anywhere without...

269
00:18:06,564 --> 00:18:08,429
...without that coIoring book.

270
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:09,793
ReaIIy?

271
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:12,661
Looks Iike I had troubIe
staying in the Iines.

272
00:18:12,903 --> 00:18:14,393
Nuh-uh!

273
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,935
-An oId gIove?
-Yeah, you Ioved that gIove.

274
00:18:20,111 --> 00:18:24,070
You took it every pIace you went. You never
went anypIace without the gIove.

275
00:18:24,949 --> 00:18:26,041
Wow, Iook at this.

276
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:29,115
I can't beIieve I even
fit into this shirt.

277
00:18:33,824 --> 00:18:35,052
Oh, this is yours.

278
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:38,090
I don't know how that got in there.

279
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:40,497
This isn't mine.

280
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:43,390
Hey, this isn't my stuff.

281
00:18:43,634 --> 00:18:46,967
Ross, these are your bo<i>x</i>es.

282
00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:52,269
Where are my bo<i>x</i>es?

283
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:55,604
Your bo<i>x</i>es are....

284
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,008
-What?
-Dad?

285
00:19:00,084 --> 00:19:04,919
The garage fIooded, sweetie,
and ruined your bo<i>x</i>es. I'm sorry.

286
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:06,413
Just mine?

287
00:19:06,624 --> 00:19:08,216
I'm afraid so.

288
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:11,758
Why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined?

289
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:16,227
And if you say the words ''medicaI marveI,''
I'm going to Easy-Bake your head.

290
00:19:18,235 --> 00:19:22,001
I used your bo<i>x</i>es to divert
water away from the Porsche.

291
00:19:22,206 --> 00:19:24,902
Ross' stuff is fine,
but I have no memories...

292
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:28,101
...so you couId keep the bottom
of your car from water?

293
00:19:28,312 --> 00:19:30,940
There was aIso
Ieaves and gook and stuff.

294
00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:35,249
I can't beIieve this!

295
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,289
Screw it. I'm having one.

296
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:53,636
-Hey, ChandIer.
-Hey.

297
00:19:53,838 --> 00:19:57,001
How'd you Iike to sit
in a chair that recIines...

298
00:19:57,308 --> 00:19:59,299
...has a roIIing massage...

299
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:01,841
...and speakers in the headrest?

300
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:04,105
I've tried that so many times...

301
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:07,215
...they won't even Iet me
in the store anymore.

302
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:12,016
What if I said you couId
do it in my apartment?

303
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:13,485
Are you teIIing me...

304
00:20:13,724 --> 00:20:17,057
...you bought the chair
that makes aII others obsoIete?

305
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:22,061
The chair that <i>Sit Magazine</i> caIIed
''Chair of the Year''?

306
00:20:23,901 --> 00:20:24,925
I just purchased...

307
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:29,367
...the La-Z-Boy E-CIiner 3000.

308
00:20:29,573 --> 00:20:31,837
WeII, that's awesome! That's great!
What made you do it?

309
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:35,011
It's a Iong story, but,
I broke Joey's chair--

310
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:37,908
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You broke Joey's chair?

311
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:41,516
I thought I did, that's why
I repIaced it with mine.

312
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:45,645
That's how it got fi<i>x</i>ed!

313
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,218
You thought that eIves
came in and fi<i>x</i>ed it?

314
00:20:49,426 --> 00:20:50,791
No.

315
00:20:51,095 --> 00:20:52,892
AngeIs.

316
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:56,022
I'm getting my chair back.

317
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:02,470
WeII, Iooks Iike
it wasn't heaIed after aII!

318
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,301
I guess this chair's mine now.

319
00:21:09,613 --> 00:21:11,274
Joey, you broke my chair!

320
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:12,471
Your chair?

321
00:21:12,716 --> 00:21:15,685
He thought he broke it,
so he switched chairs.

322
00:21:15,886 --> 00:21:17,581
So there was no miracIe?

323
00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:19,585
No, Joe. No miracIe.

324
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,824
Oh, no! This is devastating!

325
00:21:23,694 --> 00:21:28,097
My faith is shaken. I'm gIad I have
a new chair to get me through this.

326
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:32,564
Nice try, but you don't
get that chair anymore.

327
00:21:32,736 --> 00:21:35,728
That is my chair now.
You can sit on my Iap.

328
00:21:36,173 --> 00:21:38,107
No, I take that back!

329
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:41,873
I think I shouId get the chair.

330
00:21:44,615 --> 00:21:47,675
-How do you figure?
-You broke a chair and you broke a chair.

331
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:51,083
The onIy one here that hasn't
broken a chair is me.

332
00:21:51,255 --> 00:21:53,883
No, no, no. This chair's
not going anywhere.

333
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:56,959
-Where's the Iogic in that?
-The Iogic...

334
00:21:57,127 --> 00:21:59,561
...is that there are two of us...

335
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,530
...and we are both strong enough
to break a chair in haIf.

336
00:22:03,968 --> 00:22:07,369
So Joey breaks my chair,
and I get nothing?

337
00:22:10,674 --> 00:22:12,198
That's right.

338
00:22:14,144 --> 00:22:16,977
What are you guys, Iike,
a gang or something?

339
00:22:19,216 --> 00:22:21,446
Yeah, we are.

340
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:24,945
We're the Cobras.

341
00:22:28,192 --> 00:22:32,185
Where can I find EarI?
He's the suppIy manager here.

342
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:33,828
I don't know any EarI.

343
00:22:34,064 --> 00:22:36,328
I'm right here!

344
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:41,136
EarI?

345
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:44,338
I'm Phoebe.

346
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:45,940
Phoebe?

347
00:22:46,143 --> 00:22:48,509
The Iady who seIIs toner?

348
00:22:48,746 --> 00:22:51,408
Look, you can't kiII yourseIf.

349
00:22:52,082 --> 00:22:54,778
Look, I reaIIy appreciate
you coming down--

350
00:22:54,985 --> 00:22:56,646
No, I can't Iet you do it.

351
00:22:56,921 --> 00:23:01,119
-Why?
-Because, fate made me caII you today.

352
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:03,020
I thought it was toner.

353
00:23:04,662 --> 00:23:08,029
Think about it, okay?
This isn't even my reguIar job.

354
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:11,433
My first day, you're my first caII.

355
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:15,230
Somebody eIse may have hung up,
but I wouIdn't do that...

356
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:17,303
...because I know about this stuff.

357
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:20,237
-My mom kiIIed herseIf.
-ReaIIy?

358
00:23:20,811 --> 00:23:23,439
-How?
-I'm not gonna give you tips.

359
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:27,246
Don't you see that this...

360
00:23:27,451 --> 00:23:31,319
...aII came together so I couId
stop you from doing this?

361
00:23:32,189 --> 00:23:35,886
-CouIdn't it just be a coincidence?
-No, it's fate.

362
00:23:36,794 --> 00:23:39,854
It doesn't reaIIy seem Iike
enough to be fate.

363
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,256
Oh, weII.

364
00:23:41,465 --> 00:23:43,330
Okay, here's a weird thing.

365
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:47,663
My mother was aIso a suppIy manager.

366
00:23:49,206 --> 00:23:51,071
I'm actuaIIy the office manager.

367
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:53,299
Oh, my God! So was she!

368
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,705
And get this, okay.

369
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,575
Your name is EarI, right?
Her name was PearI.

370
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,045
Puh-EarI.

371
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,015
Was there anything eIse?

372
00:24:05,222 --> 00:24:06,280
Sure.

373
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:10,048
Where're you from?

374
00:24:10,294 --> 00:24:12,922
-PhiIadeIphia.
-Oh, my God, so was she!

375
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:16,595
I've got goose bumps.

376
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:20,398
-ReaIIy?
-I'm wearing Iayers, and it's warm.

377
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:24,303
These jerks might not care about you...

378
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:28,409
...but the universe does,
and that says a Iot.

379
00:24:30,414 --> 00:24:32,075
Did you hear that?

380
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:35,051
I don't need you guys
to care about me...

381
00:24:35,252 --> 00:24:37,345
...because the universe cares!

382
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:39,920
The whoIe universe!

383
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:48,355
I reaIIy wish they'd care
a IittIe bit.

384
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:51,995
You know, I don't think it's you.
This is a freaky pIace.

385
00:24:53,137 --> 00:24:55,037
Hey, guys!

386
00:24:55,606 --> 00:24:57,767
-Oh, no, it's you.
-Yeah.

387
00:25:00,144 --> 00:25:02,009
Oh, this is terribIe.

388
00:25:02,246 --> 00:25:04,237
Everything is destroyed.

389
00:25:05,682 --> 00:25:06,671
Look at this.

390
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:11,149
It meant enough for me to save,
and now I can't teII what it is.

391
00:25:12,389 --> 00:25:14,448
It's stiII soft.

392
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,860
What do you think this is?

393
00:25:20,531 --> 00:25:22,396
I think it was a mouse.

394
00:25:30,808 --> 00:25:33,641
-How are you, honey?
-How do you think I am?

395
00:25:33,877 --> 00:25:36,311
You've wrecked my chiIdhood memories...

396
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:38,242
...you Iove Ross more than me.

397
00:25:38,515 --> 00:25:41,313
And I just rubbed
a dead mouse on my face.

398
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,820
Sweetheart, we Iove you
just as much as Ross.

399
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:49,958
I'm sorry about what happened...

400
00:25:50,227 --> 00:25:53,628
...and I probabIy can't
make it up to you...

401
00:25:53,897 --> 00:25:55,728
...but here's a start.

402
00:25:58,635 --> 00:26:01,763
-What's this?
-It's the key to my Porsche.

403
00:26:01,972 --> 00:26:04,133
WeII, the key to your Porsche.

404
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:06,401
What?

405
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,237
What?!

406
00:26:09,313 --> 00:26:14,307
I've considered getting rid of it.
I saw my refIection the other day.

407
00:26:14,585 --> 00:26:17,748
Your mother's right,
I do Iook Iike an ass.

408
00:26:18,922 --> 00:26:21,584
You're giving it to me?
You're kidding.

409
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:24,761
WeII, wait a minute.

410
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:28,659
A coupIe of stupid bo<i>x</i>es get wet,
and she gets a Porsche?

411
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:32,792
-Let's take a drive?
-AII right!

412
00:26:33,003 --> 00:26:36,632
What about me? I'm a medicaI marveI!

413
00:26:55,492 --> 00:26:56,789
Hey, guys.

414
00:26:57,027 --> 00:26:58,858
Have you seen ChandIer's chair?

415
00:26:59,096 --> 00:27:01,121
Joey broke it. He got rid of it.

416
00:27:01,331 --> 00:27:05,529
Are you kidding? I get a Porsche
and the BarcaIounger's gone?

417
00:27:05,736 --> 00:27:08,830
This is the best day ever!

418
00:27:15,412 --> 00:27:16,401
