1
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:08,103
Oh, here's little Ben falling asleep.

2
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:12,938
A little bit later. Is he gonna sleep?

3
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:17,981
Is he gonna sleep? Is he gonna?

4
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,015
Yep, out like a light!

5
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:24,846
This sure trumps
the "Has he pooped?" series.

6
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,889
Ross, we love him, okay?

7
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:30,154
But right now he's just
a little fat guy.

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,888
How excited can we get?

9
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,460
-What you got?
-400 pictures of Ben on a rug.

10
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:40,663
-Oh, my God!
-Let me see!

11
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,137
The One Where Rachel Finds Out

12
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,518
Here's little Ben nodding off.

13
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,453
Look at Aunt Monica's little boy!

14
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,425
-Look, he's got Ross haircut.
-Let me see.

15
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,890
Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?

16
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:43,398
You must just wanna kiss him all over.

17
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,440
That would be nice.

18
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,638
-Pardon?
-Nothing.

19
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:56,475
Just a little extra air in my mouth.

20
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:05,013
Chan, can you help me out?
I'll pay you back.

21
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:09,685
Right. Including the waffles
last week, you now owe me...

22
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:12,327
... 1 7 jillion dollars.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,562
-Really, I'll pay you back this time.
-Where's this money coming from?

24
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:21,229
I'm helping out at the NYU
Med School with research.

25
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,068
What kind of research?

26
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,104
Just, you know, science.

27
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,441
Science.

28
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,876
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

29
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,654
It's a fertility study.

30
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:44,189
Joey, please tell me you're only
donating your time.

31
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:48,560
Actually, a little more than that.

32
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:54,065
Thank you, God.
This will bring us so much joy.

33
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,170
Come on, it's not that big a deal.

34
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,937
I just go down there
every other day...

35
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:03,310
...and make my contribution
to the project.

36
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,281
But at the end of two weeks,
I get $700!

37
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:10,719
You're gonna be making money
hand over fist.

38
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,818
That's funny. Very funny.

39
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:20,800
This is great. I actually know
somebody who loves what they do.

40
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:27,066
But what do you do to unwind
after a tough day at work?

41
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,334
Okay, we got the coleslaw and buns.

42
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:36,949
The ground-up flesh
of formerly cute cows and turkeys.

43
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,154
I just love barbecuing with you.

44
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,913
Men are here!

45
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,586
We make fire.

46
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,223
Cook meat.

47
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,426
Put out fire by peeing,
no get invited back.

48
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,002
Cute.

49
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:02,175
-Melanie called. She'll be late.
-Okay.

50
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:07,472
How are things going? Is she
becoming your "special someone"?

51
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,783
I don't know. She's pretty great.

52
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,751
What does she think of
your little science project?

53
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:20,856
You think I'd tell a girl I like
that I'm also seeing a cup?

54
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,454
Man's got a point.

55
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:29,361
The tough thing is,
she really wants to have sex.

56
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,469
Crazy bitch.

57
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:40,170
I got a week left to go.
According to the rules...

58
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:45,942
... I can't conduct personal
experiments, if you know what I mean.

59
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:49,816
Joey, we always know what you mean.

60
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,622
How long did you think
this barbecue would last?

61
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:05,429
-I'm going to China.
-Jeez, you say one thing, and....

62
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,166
-China?
-For the museum. Someone found a bone.

63
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,572
They don't want us to have it.

64
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:18,217
I'm going to try to persuade them.
It's a whole big bone thing.

65
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,818
Anyway, I'll be gone for a week.

66
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:26,323
If you want to reach me, you can't.
So here's my itinerary.

67
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:30,227
-Here's a picture of me.
-Oh, let me see.

68
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,793
Could you show it to Ben every now
and then so he doesn't forget me?

69
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:39,399
"Hi, Ben. I'm your father."

70
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,869
"I am The Head!"

71
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,251
This barbecue's gonna be very fun.

72
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:56,149
I wanted to wish Rachel
a happy birthday before I left.

73
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:01,259
-She's out having drinks with Carl.
-Hey, who's Carl?

74
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,432
That guy she met at the coffeehouse.

75
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:11,195
-There's this guy she met at
-The coffeehouse? Right.

76
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,463
So you do know who he is.

77
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,744
I'll go say goodbye to the guys.

78
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:23,313
Hey, you know what?
Tell them that bone story.

79
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,656
-I have to go to China.
-The country?

80
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:39,165
No, this big pile of dishes
in my mom's breakfront.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,695
Do you know who Carl is?

82
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:46,362
Let's see. Alvin, Simon, Theodore....
No.

83
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,437
Rachel's having
drinks with him tonight.

84
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:54,273
How can she, when she's never
shown interest in you?

85
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,609
-Forget about her.
-He's right.

86
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,786
Please move on. Go to China.
Eat Chinese food.

87
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,414
Of course, there
they just call it "food."

88
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:08,253
Yeah, I guess. I don't know.

89
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:12,089
All right, just give her this
for me, okay?

90
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:15,894
We're looking out for you.
We want you to be happy.

91
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:20,596
I may only have a couple beers
in me, but I love you.

92
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,376
I'm still on my first.

93
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,612
I just think you're nice.

94
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,123
That's when we started
this fruit basket business.

95
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:44,923
We call ourselves
"The Three Basketeers."

96
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:48,566
Like "The Three Musketeers,"
only with fruit.

97
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,843
-How do you want your burgers?
-Presents first!

98
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,842
We're doing presents first.

99
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,578
Hey, hold on there, tiger.
How are you holding up?

100
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:10,654
Well, not so good.
She thinks tonight we're gonna...

101
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:15,157
...complete the transaction,
if you know what And you do.

102
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,923
Have you ever thought about
being there for her?

103
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,264
What do you mean?

104
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:28,502
You know, just be there for her.

105
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,340
Not following you.

106
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,507
Think about it.

107
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:47,557
Okay. I'm guessing this is from....

108
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,657
-Thank you, Melanie.
-This one right here is from me.

109
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:58,770
Okay. It's light. It rattles.

110
00:08:59,005 --> 00:08:59,994
It's...

111
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,039
...Travel Scrabble!

112
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,010
Thank you.

113
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,146
This one's from Joey.

114
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:19,155
It feels like a book, I think it's
a book. And it's a book!

115
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,259
It's Dr. Seuss!

116
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,956
That book got me through
some tough times.

117
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,161
There's a little child
inside this man.

118
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:33,066
The doctors say if they remove it,
he'll die.

119
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,334
-Who's this from?
-From Ross.

120
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:47,647
Oh, my God! He remembered!

121
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,784
-Remembered what?
-lt was months ago.

122
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:54,493
We walked by this antique store.
I saw this pin.

123
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:59,425
I told him it was like one
my grandma had when I was little.

124
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,191
I can't believe he remembered!

125
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,997
Well, sure, but can you
play it on a plane?

126
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,878
It's so pretty!
This must've cost him a fortune.

127
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,241
I can't believe it.

128
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,441
Remember when he
fell in love with Carol...

129
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:23,110
...and bought her that
expensive crystal duck?

130
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,854
What did you just say?

131
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,337
Crystal duck.

132
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:48,708
No, no, no. The "love" part?

133
00:10:54,988 --> 00:11:00,893
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, no, no, no.

134
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:06,857
That's good. Just keep rubbing
your head. That'll turn back time.

135
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,575
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable!

136
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,404
I know.
This is really, really huge.

137
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:24,072
No, it's not. It's small.
It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.

138
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:29,278
I don't think any of our lives
will ever be the same ever again.

139
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:33,253
Is there a mute button on this woman?

140
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,088
I think this is so great.
I mean, you and Ross!

141
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:40,266
-Did you have any idea?
-No, none!

142
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:44,334
My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out...

143
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,528
... but nothing ever happened.

144
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,902
What else did he say?
Does he wanna go out?

145
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,543
Given that he's in love with you...

146
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,146
... he wouldn't mind getting
a cup of coffee.

147
00:11:56,516 --> 00:12:01,544
Ross? All this time?
I've gotta talk to him.

148
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,723
-He's in China!
-The country.

149
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,427
Is his flight gone?

150
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:12,689
Yes! He's watching a woman do this:

151
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:13,888
He's gone!

152
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,796
His flight doesn't leave
for 45 minutes.

153
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:20,905
-What about time difference?
-From here to the airport?

154
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,668
-You'll never make it!
-I've gotta try.

155
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,868
What'll you say to him?

156
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,742
-I don't know.
-Then you shouldn't go.

157
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,612
Right. If you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.

158
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,911
But if it's good, tell him now.

159
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:40,957
-Maybe I'll know when I see him.
-All right, does this help?

160
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:52,269
No. Look, all I know is, I cannot
wait a week. This is just too big.

161
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:56,568
I've just gotta talk to him.
Okay, I'll see you later.

162
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,439
Rachel, I love you!
Deal with me first!

163
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:13,981
All right.

164
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,996
-Ross! Excuse me, pardon me.
-Your boarding pass?

165
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,136
I need to talk to my friend.

166
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:29,274
Sorry, you're not allowed here
without a pass.

167
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,706
He's right there,
in the blue jacket! Can l?

168
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,880
I'm sorry. Federal regulations!

169
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:39,040
Then could you please
just give him a message for me?

170
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:43,311
-This is very important.
-All right. What's the message?

171
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,119
I don't know.

172
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:52,828
Excuse me, sir! Excuse me, sir?
I have a message for you.

173
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:57,366
Rachel loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.

174
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,197
What?

175
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,301
Toby, I don't know
what she's talking about.

176
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:07,943
There's no Rachel.
Don't give me that deep freeze.

177
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:21,249
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

178
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:25,056
I think I blacked out there
for a minute.

179
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:28,124
It was nothing.

180
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:32,327
Well, now we gotta
find something fun for you.

181
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,275
You know what?

182
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:42,841
Forget about me.
Let's give you another turn.

183
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:49,252
-Me, again?
-Sure. Why not?

184
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:57,854
Boy, somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!

185
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:06,899
I gotta tell you, you are nothing like
I thought you'd be.

186
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,471
How do you mean?

187
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:13,111
I had you pegged as a guy
who's always, "Me, me, me!"

188
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,576
But you, you're a giver.

189
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,815
You're the most generous man
I ever met.

190
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,046
I mean, you're practically a woman.

191
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:35,229
-You're just saying that.
-No.

192
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,564
A woman!

193
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,781
-So?
-I missed him.

194
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,418
-I'm so sorry.
-That's too bad.

195
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,281
Yeah, right.

196
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,049
No, I feel bad for her. I do.

197
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,750
I can think of somebody
other than myself.

198
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,021
All right, I'm going to bed.

199
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,033
-Happy birthday. Hang in there.
-Thanks.

200
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:11,992
Yes!

201
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,738
Pizza coupons.

202
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:24,672
Okay. You guys want help
cleaning up this mess?

203
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,442
That'd be great.

204
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,986
So, Rach, you wanna save
this wrapping paper?

205
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:37,993
Are you gonna go for it with Ross
or should I throw it out?

206
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:44,826
I don't know. I don't know.

207
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,528
Thought about it
all the way there...

208
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,643
...and I thought about it all the way
back. You know, it's Ross!

209
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,245
You know what I mean? It's Ross.

210
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,177
-Sure!
-Sure.

211
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:02,650
I don't know. This is just
my initial gut feeling...

212
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:07,216
... but I'm thinking
it'd be really great.

213
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:11,021
Oh, my God, me too!
We'd be like friends-in-law!

214
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,461
The best part is you already
know all about him.

215
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,795
You start on the 1 5th date.

216
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:21,405
But it would be like
starting on the 1 5th date.

217
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,208
Another good point.

218
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,642
I mean, on the 1 5th date,
you're already in a very...

219
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:32,079
... "relationship-y" place.
You're committed.

220
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,988
What happens if it doesn't work out?

221
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,159
-Why isn't it working out?
-Sometimes it doesn't.

222
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:45,125
Is he not cute enough?
Does he not make enough money?

223
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:48,300
-No, I'm just
-Maybe there's someone else.

224
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:53,165
-ls there someone else?
-No, there is no one else.

225
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,000
Then why are you dumping my brother?

226
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,415
Hey, big Spender!

227
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,916
She's still asleep.

228
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:18,856
-So how'd it go?
-You know how you think you're great?

229
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:23,092
The fact you'd even ask
shows how little you know me.

230
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:28,137
Last night I couldn't do the thing
that usually makes me great.

231
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,775
So I had to do all this other stuff.

232
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,775
And the response I got! Man, oh, man!

233
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:37,039
It was like a ticker-tape parade!

234
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:43,020
I know. My room's very, very close
to the parade route.

235
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:51,121
It was amazing, and not just for her.
For me too!

236
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:54,561
It's like, all of a sudden
I'm blind...

237
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,565
... but all my other senses
are heightened.

238
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,671
It's like I was able
to appreciate it...

239
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,964
...on another level.

240
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:10,481
-I didn't know you had another level.
-I know. Neither did l!

241
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,420
Is something going on with O.J.?

242
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,356
Hey, great skirt. Birthday present?

243
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,727
-From who?
-You.

244
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,631
I exchanged the blouse you got me.

245
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,465
Well, it's the thought.

246
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:40,677
Doesn't Ross'flight get in
in a couple hours? At gate 27B?

247
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:46,583
Yeah. Monica, you know, I've been
thinking about it.

248
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:50,084
I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.

249
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,278
Why?

250
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,085
I feel like I wouldn't
just be going out with him.

251
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:59,094
I'd be going out with all of you.
There'd be pressure

252
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,128
No pressure, no pressure!

253
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,735
Nothing has happened,
and you're already so

254
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:09,897
I'm not "so." Okay, I was a teensy
bit weird at first...

255
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:13,237
... but I'll be good. I promise.

256
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,775
-Who is it?
-It's me, Carl.

257
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,885
-Come on up.
-Behind my brother's back?

258
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:30,821
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.

259
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:46,106
-Seven hundred bucks!
-All right, you did it!

260
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:48,610
Do we have any fruit?

261
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,783
Man, hell of a two weeks.

262
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:55,987
You know what?
I feel I learned something.

263
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,782
You'll stick with this
"all for her" thing?

264
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,616
What are you, crazy?

265
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:06,224
When a blind man gets his sight back,
does he walk around like this?

266
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,633
If I see one more picture
of Ed Begley Jr...

267
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:19,368
...in that stupid electric car,
I'm gonna shoot myself!

268
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,347
I'm not against
environmental issues, per se...

269
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,211
...it's just that guy!

270
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:30,645
I can't believe you'd rather
go out with him than me.

271
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,082
Excuse me, I'm trying
to have a date here.

272
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,654
Fine. Just stop thinking about me.

273
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,393
Can't do it, can you?

274
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,501
I'm thinking about you. So what?

275
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:48,901
I don't get it.
What do you see in this guy?

276
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,566
Happens to be a very nice guy.

277
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:55,906
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!

278
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:02,617
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.

279
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,914
Ross, it's too hard.

280
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:09,823
Why, because it'll get weird
for everyone else? This is about us.

281
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:13,465
I've been in love with you
since the ninth grade.

282
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:18,465
You're like my best friend.
If we broke up, and I lost you

283
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,468
What makes you think that?

284
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:25,006
Have you been involved
where you haven't broken up?

285
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,068
No.

286
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:32,714
But it only has to happen once.

287
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:37,718
You and I both know we are perfect
for each other. Right?

288
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:42,292
So the only question is:
Are you attracted to me?

289
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,363
I don't know.

290
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,835
I mean, I've never looked at you
that way before.

291
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,230
Well, start looking.

292
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,173
-Wow.
-Exactly!

293
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,351
And I'm gonna be the guy...

294
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,851
...caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!

295
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,754
Right! You're right.

296
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:17,653
You know what?

297
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:21,196
I'm supposed to pick up
a friend at the airport.

298
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,458
I am so sorry!

299
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:26,899
If you wanna finish your drinks,
please do.

300
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:30,598
-I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry.
-But....

301
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:38,849
-Where are you going?
-To get Ross.

302
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,417
-My God, this is so exciting!
-I know.

303
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,954
If you want the rest of my date,
I'm not gonna finish it.

304
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:51,954
-Rachel, he's not a sandwich.
-No, he's a banker with opera tickets.

305
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,096
Hello!

306
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,469
-Where you going?
-Airport.

307
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:04,039
You can't tell him.
There's so much I haven't done.

308
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:07,212
I haven't watched Baywatch
with Yasmine Bleeth!

309
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,783
Chandler, relax. This is a good
going to the airport.

310
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:17,016
Oh, well then fly, good woman,
fly like the wind.

311
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:20,191
-I'm flying!
-Tell him I'm the one who blew it!

312
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,427
Yes, another successful case
for the love doctor.

313
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,073
Excuse me! Pardon me.
Excuse me. Sorry.

314
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,972
Toby, for God's sake,
will you let it go?

315
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,714
There's no Rachel!

316
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,589
Hey! I got that.

317
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:54,285
-Thanks, sweetie.
-No problem.

318
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,962
I can't wait for you
to meet my friends.

319
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,864
You don't think they'll judge me?

320
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,835
-No, they will. I just....
-Can't wait!

321
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,532
Come on, they're gonna love you.
