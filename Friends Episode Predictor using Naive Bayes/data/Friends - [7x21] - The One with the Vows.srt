1
00:00:02,644 --> 00:00:06,119
Do you realize we're getting
married in four weeks?

2
00:00:06,367 --> 00:00:09,284
Four weeks, baby. Four weeks!

3
00:00:09,915 --> 00:00:12,204
Do you realize you get
louder each week?

4
00:00:13,116 --> 00:00:16,699
There's still so much to do!
Have you written your vows yet?

5
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:21,392
I figured I'd just buy those.
"Pat, I'd like to buy a vow."

6
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:25,532
You know I've no sense of humor
when it comes to the wedding.

7
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:31,899
- Right. Have you written yours yet?
- No, but I know what I'm gonna say.

8
00:00:32,913 --> 00:00:36,246
Do you happen to know exactly
what I'm gonna say?

9
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,390
Let's do it now. It won't be hard.

10
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:42,510
Say what's in your heart.

11
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,871
Look at her go. She must love me
more than I love her!

12
00:00:53,544 --> 00:00:57,648
What's wrong with me?
Don't open that door.

13
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:03,345
The One With The Vows

14
00:01:38,878 --> 00:01:43,433
"Monica, there are no words..."

15
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,271
There are no words!
This shouldn't be this hard!

16
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:54,424
You've done this before.
What did you say in your vows?

17
00:01:54,638 --> 00:01:58,980
With Carol, I promised never to love
another woman until the day I die.

18
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:01,033
She made no such promise.

19
00:02:01,944 --> 00:02:06,536
I'm so pathetic. Monica knows what to
say. You should have seen her writing.

20
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:11,157
What's the emergency?

21
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:15,441
You have to help me. I'm supposed
to write my vows and all I have is this.

22
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:19,366
I like the pretty drawing of you
in the wedding dress.

23
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,477
Except your breasts look kind of small.

24
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:27,822
Those are my eyes!

25
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:33,175
- Those are my breasts.
- Oh, yeah, okay.

26
00:02:35,727 --> 00:02:39,238
Why don't you just start
with something simple, like:

27
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,622
"Monica, from the moment I met you,
I knew I loved you."

28
00:02:44,843 --> 00:02:46,539
I'm not sure I can do that.

29
00:02:46,756 --> 00:02:49,294
Everyone, this is Chandler.

30
00:02:49,505 --> 00:02:51,557
Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.

31
00:02:52,427 --> 00:02:53,886
Okay.

32
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:59,657
Okay, okay.
Maybe you could start with:

33
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:02,755
"Chandler, even though
we were friends...

34
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:06,233
...there was a part of me
that always knew I wanted more."

35
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:11,170
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust.
I'm the last man on earth.

36
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:13,612
Would you go out with me?

37
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:20,953
Are we allowed to lie in the vows?

38
00:03:22,383 --> 00:03:24,779
Maybe you don't talk about
your feelings back then.

39
00:03:25,027 --> 00:03:30,199
Just say something about all the things
that he's taught you, like...

40
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,793
Or all the things you taught him.

41
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:41,578
Everybody knows
the basic erogenous zones.

42
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:43,848
You got one, two, three...

43
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,347
...four, five...

44
00:03:46,564 --> 00:03:48,640
...six and seven.

45
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,941
There are seven?

46
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:56,963
- That's one?
- Kind of an important one.

47
00:03:57,941 --> 00:04:00,123
I was looking at it upside down.

48
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:05,651
Well, you know, sometimes that helps.

49
00:04:10,222 --> 00:04:13,412
Okay, now, start out
with a little one...

50
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:16,442
...a two, a one-two-three...

51
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:20,862
...a three, a five...

52
00:04:21,947 --> 00:04:24,687
...a four, a three-two...

53
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:26,921
...two, a two-four-six.

54
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:31,537
Two-four-six, four, two...

55
00:04:32,175 --> 00:04:34,393
...two, four-seven...

56
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:38,220
...five-seven, six-seven...

57
00:04:38,437 --> 00:04:40,904
...seven, seven...

58
00:04:41,151 --> 00:04:44,485
...seven, seven, seven, seven, seven...

59
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,088
...seven!

60
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,970
I got it!
How about saying something like:

61
00:04:57,225 --> 00:05:01,875
"Monica, when I look back
over our time together..."

62
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:08,703
- Yeah?
- I can't do everything.

63
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,241
Look back over your time together.

64
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:15,802
Oh, look, twins!

65
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:19,903
No fair! I don't even have one,
how come they get two?

66
00:05:20,327 --> 00:05:22,924
- You'll get one.
- Yeah, when?

67
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:24,426
I'll tell you what.

68
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:29,991
When we're 40, if neither of us are married,
what do you say you and I have one?

69
00:05:30,173 --> 00:05:33,055
Why wouldn't I be married
when I'm 40?

70
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:35,345
Oh, no. No, I just
meant hypothetically.

71
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:38,590
Hypothetically, why won't I
be married when I'm 40?

72
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:39,904
No, no.

73
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:44,809
What is it? Seriously, is there something
fundamentally un-marriable about me?

74
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:47,105
Well?

75
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:50,516
Dear God, this parachute
is a knapsack!

76
00:05:52,996 --> 00:05:54,312
I'm getting married today!

77
00:05:57,832 --> 00:05:59,849
Do you think he knew I was here?

78
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:08,120
Nice try.

79
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,142
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

80
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:14,350
Look, Monica...

81
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:22,286
- This is not gonna work.
- I bet this will work.

82
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:33,308
You are so great! I love you.

83
00:06:43,026 --> 00:06:44,236
What?

84
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:48,483
Nothing! I said, you're so great,
and then I just stopped talking.

85
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:53,768
- You said you love me! I can't believe this.
- No, I didn't.

86
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:58,088
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't!

87
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:01,674
- You love me!
- No, I don't!

88
00:07:01,884 --> 00:07:03,651
Stop it! Stop it!

89
00:07:07,938 --> 00:07:11,971
You know, I was thinking,
what if I unpack here?

90
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:14,571
Then all your stuff would be here.

91
00:07:16,148 --> 00:07:17,464
Well...

92
00:07:20,184 --> 00:07:21,952
What if all my stuff was here?

93
00:07:22,654 --> 00:07:25,608
Then you'd be going back and forth
all the time.

94
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:27,793
Doesn't make any sense.

95
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,820
Okay.

96
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:36,077
What if we live together,
and you understand what I'm saying?

97
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:46,970
You wanted it to be a surprise.

98
00:07:57,307 --> 00:07:58,801
Oh, my God!

99
00:08:05,414 --> 00:08:06,967
Chandler...

100
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:10,069
...in all my life...

101
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:13,651
...I never thought
I would be so lucky...

102
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,719
...as to fall in love with my best...

103
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:23,772
My best...

104
00:08:24,793 --> 00:08:28,647
- There's a reason why girls don't do this!
- Okay, okay, okay! I'll do it.

105
00:08:29,837 --> 00:08:31,569
I thought...

106
00:08:35,926 --> 00:08:37,455
I can do this.

107
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:42,848
I thought...

108
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:48,265
...that it mattered what I said
or where I said it.

109
00:08:48,938 --> 00:08:54,109
Then I realized the only thing
that matters is that you...

110
00:08:58,158 --> 00:09:02,500
You make me happier
than I ever thought I could be.

111
00:09:05,603 --> 00:09:07,335
And if you let me...

112
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:12,317
...I'll spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way.

113
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:22,787
Monica?

114
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:26,336
Will you marry me?

115
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:30,191
Yes.

116
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,856
Can we come in yet?
We're dying out here!

117
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:48,633
Come in! Come in!

118
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,114
- We're engaged!
- Yes!

119
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,964
- Hi.
- What have you guys been up to?

120
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:06,588
We were helping Chandler write
his vows, but he kicked us out...

121
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:09,472
...because Joey kept making
inappropriate suggestions.

122
00:10:11,498 --> 00:10:15,318
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass"
inappropriate?

123
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:18,793
How's Monica doing?

124
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:22,939
Let's say it's lucky she's got a sweet ass
because she's not so good at the writing.

125
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:27,184
I can't believe in four weeks
they're gonna be married!

126
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,519
Let's just hope it works.

127
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:32,505
Nine out of 10 marriages
end in divorce.

128
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:34,251
Phoebe, that's not true.

129
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:36,643
Yeah, you're right. How's the missus?

130
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:40,748
I can't believe they've
been together 3 years.

131
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,244
That long?

132
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:45,867
Maybe it seems like less because
they hid it from us for so long.

133
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,524
Hey, it's me. Coming in.

134
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:58,664
I've had a very long, hard day.

135
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:03,013
- I'm gonna get some chicken. Want some?
- No, thanks. No, chicken. Bye, then.

136
00:11:07,896 --> 00:11:12,547
Are you okay? I'm sorry. He wouldn't leave.
He kept asking if I wanted chicken.

137
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:14,012
Chicken?

138
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:16,901
I could eat some chicken.

139
00:11:18,368 --> 00:11:19,791
Hey, Joe!

140
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:26,329
Can I get a three-piece, some coleslaw
and some beans and a Coke?

141
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:28,733
Diet Coke.

142
00:11:32,876 --> 00:11:37,147
- I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
- It's not like we weren't cool about it.

143
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,246
You? And you?

144
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:43,590
You cannot tell. No one knows.

145
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,568
How? When?

146
00:11:46,132 --> 00:11:49,228
- It happened in London.
- In London?!

147
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,924
We didn't tell anyone, because we didn't
want to make a big deal out of it.

148
00:11:55,178 --> 00:11:57,325
But it is a big deal!

149
00:11:57,822 --> 00:12:00,218
- I have to tell someone.
- No, no!

150
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,025
- You can't.
- Please!

151
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:07,389
We don't want to deal with telling
everyone. Just promise you won't tell.

152
00:12:11,008 --> 00:12:12,361
All right!

153
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:17,439
I can't wait to be with you. I'll tell
Rachel I'm doing laundry for a few hours.

154
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:20,534
Laundry? Is that my new nickname?

155
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:27,871
You know what your nickname is,
Mr. Big...

156
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:34,560
Oh, look, there's Monica and Chandler.
Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!

157
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:47,431
Chandler and Monica!
Chandler and Monica!

158
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:49,102
Oh, my God!

159
00:12:49,314 --> 00:12:52,196
- Chandler and Monica!
- Oh, my God!

160
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:56,087
- Oh, my eyes! My eyes!
- Phoebe! Phoebe!

161
00:12:56,411 --> 00:13:00,052
- It's okay! It's okay!
- No! They're doing it!

162
00:13:00,273 --> 00:13:01,447
I know! I know!

163
00:13:01,665 --> 00:13:03,053
- You know?
- Yes, I know!

164
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,941
And Joey knows, but Ross doesn't know,
so you have to stop screaming!

165
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,274
- Hey, what's going on?
- Oh, hi!

166
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:12,337
What? What?

167
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:15,580
Oh, God! We're just so excited that
you might get this apartment!

168
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:20,340
- Actually, it looks really good.
- It looks pretty good!

169
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:23,262
Get in here! Come on!

170
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:29,737
So they know you know,
and they don't know that Rachel knows?

171
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,938
Yes, but you know what? It
doesn't matter who knows what.

172
00:13:33,152 --> 00:13:36,485
Now enough of us know,
that we can just tell them we know.

173
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,548
Now all the lying and the secrets
will finally be over.

174
00:13:39,797 --> 00:13:44,352
Or we could not tell them we know
and have a little fun of our own.

175
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,798
All right, we better go if we're gonna
catch that movie.

176
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:50,229
- Bye.
- Bye.

177
00:13:50,477 --> 00:13:53,075
Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.

178
00:13:58,515 --> 00:14:01,397
Did you see that? With the
inappropriate and the pinching?

179
00:14:01,611 --> 00:14:02,679
Actually, I did.

180
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:06,303
So now do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

181
00:14:07,526 --> 00:14:10,551
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, she knows about us!

182
00:14:10,761 --> 00:14:14,130
- Phoebe knows about us!
- Well, I didn't tell them.

183
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,224
Them? Who's them?

184
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,987
Phoebe and Joey.

185
00:14:22,938 --> 00:14:24,077
Joey!

186
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:25,684
And Rachel.

187
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:28,950
I would've told you,
but they made me promise not to tell.

188
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:32,606
Oh, man. They think they are so slick,
messing with us!

189
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,939
But, see, they don't know that we know
that they know.

190
00:14:37,412 --> 00:14:39,321
- So...
- Ah, yes!

191
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:42,451
The messers become the messees!

192
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:47,876
Oh, my God, he wants me to come over
and feel his bicep and more!

193
00:14:48,092 --> 00:14:49,231
Are you kidding?

194
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,952
I can't believe he'd do that to Mo...

195
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:03,498
Joey? Do they know that we know?

196
00:15:04,062 --> 00:15:06,245
- No.
- Joey!

197
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:09,070
- They know you know.
- I knew it!

198
00:15:10,116 --> 00:15:12,192
I cannot believe those two!

199
00:15:12,447 --> 00:15:16,302
They thought that they could mess with
us? They're trying to mess with us?

200
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,870
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

201
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:25,176
Joey, you can't say anything.

202
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,334
Couldn't if I wanted to.

203
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:32,347
This is getting out of hand!
She wants me to put lotion on her!

204
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,872
She's bluffing!

205
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:36,412
She's not backing down.
She went like this:

206
00:15:39,514 --> 00:15:42,396
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

207
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:47,270
Oh, man. Aren't you guys done yet?

208
00:15:47,482 --> 00:15:52,594
The sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler,
the sooner this is all over and in the open.

209
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,193
- I like that.
- Okay.

210
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:59,092
Okay, show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

211
00:16:06,513 --> 00:16:09,218
Wow! You didn't rip off any buttons.

212
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:10,990
It's not my first time.

213
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:15,976
You go back out there
and seduce her till she cracks.

214
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,952
Okay, give me a second.

215
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:21,715
- Did you clean up in here?
- Of course.

216
00:16:27,597 --> 00:16:28,877
Oh, you're going?

217
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:31,283
Not without you, lover.

218
00:16:36,365 --> 00:16:39,520
So this is my bra.

219
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,191
It's very, very nice.

220
00:16:47,498 --> 00:16:49,823
Well, come here.

221
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:52,916
I'm very happy
we're gonna have all the sex.

222
00:16:54,526 --> 00:16:57,930
You should be. I'm very bendy.

223
00:17:02,736 --> 00:17:06,070
- I'm gonna kiss you now.
- Not if I kiss you first.

224
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,314
I guess there's nothing left
for us to do but kiss.

225
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,028
Here it comes.

226
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:34,594
Our first kiss.

227
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:47,058
- Okay, okay, okay, fine, you win!
- Ha!

228
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,002
- I can't have sex with you.
- Why not?

229
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:51,958
- Because I'm in love with Monica.
- You're what?

230
00:17:54,472 --> 00:17:59,549
Love her! That's right, I love her!
I love her!

231
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,016
I love you, Monica.

232
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:09,109
I love you too, Chandler.

233
00:18:14,546 --> 00:18:17,951
I thought you guys were doing it.
I didn't know you were in love.

234
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:22,687
So that's it, it's over.
Everybody knows.

235
00:18:22,896 --> 00:18:26,859
- Well, actually, Ross doesn't.
- We'd appreciate if no one told him yet.

236
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:28,529
No.

237
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:33,156
What are you doing?

238
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:36,666
Get off my sister!

239
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:42,342
Your friends getting married,
it's gotta change things.

240
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,286
You think it'll be that different?

241
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:47,563
How could it not be?
Soon, they're gonna have kids...

242
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:51,106
...and hang out with other couples
who have kids.

243
00:18:51,322 --> 00:18:53,682
And maybe they'll leave the city...

244
00:18:53,896 --> 00:18:56,886
...to be near a Volvo dealership.

245
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,331
Things change.

246
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:04,810
But I don't want them
to move to a Volvo dealership.

247
00:19:06,491 --> 00:19:07,950
It'll be okay, Joe.

248
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:12,220
Sorry. I just...
I like things the way they are.

249
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:14,865
Who's this little naked guy?

250
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:17,195
That little naked guy would be me.

251
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:20,539
Look at the little thing.

252
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:22,178
Yes.

253
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:27,708
Yes, fine, that is my penis.
Can we be grownups now?

254
00:19:29,314 --> 00:19:31,852
- Who are those people?
- Got me.

255
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:34,384
That's Nana right there in the middle.

256
00:19:34,602 --> 00:19:36,963
- Wow.
- Let's see.

257
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,882
"Me and the gang at Java Joe's."

258
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,646
Monica, you look like your grandmother.
How old was she there?

259
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:45,762
Let's see, 1939.

260
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:48,055
Yeah, 24, 25.

261
00:19:49,493 --> 00:19:51,118
Looks like a fun gang.

262
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,268
Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked.

263
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:02,326
Let me see.

264
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,981
No, that would be me again.

265
00:20:11,412 --> 00:20:14,366
- Hey, you guys.
- What's going on?

266
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:17,080
Well, we were just talking about...

267
00:20:17,326 --> 00:20:20,552
...you guys getting married
and how great it is.

268
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:24,769
Yeah, you can get a Volvo.
If that's what you really want.

269
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,449
That's so sweet.

270
00:20:28,843 --> 00:20:32,592
- So we both finished our vows.
- Can we read them?

271
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:36,355
Just as long as I don't hear Chandler's
and he doesn't hear mine.

272
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:47,452
Oh, that's beautiful.

273
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:50,332
Funny one! That's good!

274
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:54,056
Monica, will you marry me?

275
00:20:56,954 --> 00:20:58,828
What? I don't get it.

276
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,804
Oh, yeah!

277
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,163
- Man, this is hilarious!
- Chandler!

278
00:21:07,426 --> 00:21:10,000
Don't worry, honey.
We'll make yours funnier.

279
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:18,903
Okay, what do you guys think?

280
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:25,722
- Dude...
- I have never known love like this.

281
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:29,170
- You really like it?
- Dude!

282
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,364
How did you write this?

283
00:21:32,581 --> 00:21:35,154
I stole Monica's
and changed the name.

284
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:40,994
- You can't do that!
- If he goes first, he can!
