1
00:00:02,781 --> 00:00:05,841
-Previously on Friends:
-l don't feel like l have a girlfriend.

2
00:00:06,051 --> 00:00:09,043
You want me to quit my job so you
can feel like you have a girlfriend?

3
00:00:09,354 --> 00:00:11,151
-ls this about Mark?
-Oh, my God.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,688
-Okay, it's not.
-Oh, my God.

5
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:16,052
l cannot keep having
the same fight with you!

6
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:18,523
Look, maybe we should
just take a break.

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,755
Fine. You're right.
Let's take a break.

8
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:23,160
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.

9
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:24,563
No.

10
00:00:25,037 --> 00:00:26,868
A break from us.

11
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:32,633
Then we had this big, stupid fight,
and l said l wanted to take a break.

12
00:00:32,978 --> 00:00:34,639
l don't want to take a break.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,074
This is crazy.

14
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:37,943
Don't you think
we can work on this?

15
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:39,174
What do you want to drink?

16
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:40,509
Who's that?

17
00:00:42,154 --> 00:00:43,644
Nobody.

18
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:44,913
ls that Mark?

19
00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:46,283
Honey, look, he just--

20
00:00:46,658 --> 00:00:48,057
Yeah. Got it!

21
00:00:49,394 --> 00:00:52,329
Hey, come dance.
What, are you married?

22
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:54,292
Because that's okay.

23
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:12,810
How was the big anniversary dinner?

24
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:16,419
Well, we never actually got to dinner.

25
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:17,980
Nice.

26
00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:21,821
No, we kind of broke up instead.

27
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,322
What?

28
00:01:26,632 --> 00:01:28,623
My God, Monica!
lt's on the ceiling!

29
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,892
That's okay.

30
00:01:30,202 --> 00:01:32,227
This is more important than fruit...

31
00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:34,137
...on my ceiling.

32
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:36,833
You broke up?

33
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:41,002
Yeah, but it's okay because
when Ross left, Mark came over.

34
00:01:41,246 --> 00:01:43,737
-Oh, no! You and Mark?
-lt's okay. Calm down.

35
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:45,448
Mark and l talked...

36
00:01:45,717 --> 00:01:49,881
...and l realized how much
l love your stupid brother, and...

37
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:53,586
...yeah, we got our problems,
but l really wanna make it work.

38
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:12,442
Morning!

39
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,708
The One the Morning After

40
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:12,163
Hi, it's me. I've been trying
to reach you all night. I feel awful.

41
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:15,465
Please, Ross, you've gotta know
there's nothing between me and Mark.

42
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,905
This whole breakup thing
is just stupid.

43
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:23,409
I'm just so sorry I put you through it.

44
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:27,211
And I don't want to get
back together over a machine.

45
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:30,287
-So I love you.
-l love you.

46
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:33,856
And you know what?
I'm gonna go to bed now...

47
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:38,826
...but on my way to work tomorrow,
I'm gonna stop by around 8:30. Bye.

48
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:43,398
Chloe, how's it coming?

49
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:46,034
What kind of puppy do you think
l should get?

50
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:48,195
You know, l don't know.
How about a big one?

51
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:51,064
-But my apartment's so--
-Well, then a small one.

52
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:53,711
-Listen, we have to go.
-Wait! Where's my shoes?

53
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,676
You sure you need shoes?

54
00:03:58,383 --> 00:03:59,782
Do l know why we're rushing?

55
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:02,181
Yeah, you know the girlfriend
l told you about?

56
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:05,446
Well, it turns out that she wants
to get back together with me.

57
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,782
l found it!

58
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,017
That's so great for you guys!

59
00:04:09,194 --> 00:04:10,684
You must be so happy!

60
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:13,626
Yes, l am. One of the many
things l'm feeling.

61
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:18,699
-Good luck with your girlfriend.
-Oh, thank you.

62
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:31,005
-You got my message?
-You are right on time!

63
00:04:31,316 --> 00:04:33,750
So, what do you say?
Can l be your girlfriend again?

64
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,477
Yes, you can. Very much.

65
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:47,523
-Why are you mopping your ceiling?
-There's banana on it.

66
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:52,125
l have the spirit of an
old lndian woman living in mine.

67
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:54,463
So then you know.

68
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:00,300
The mailman was downstairs,
so l brought up your mail.

69
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,379
-Oh, good. Thanks.
-Now, what is Fabutech?

70
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:06,713
All right, don't judge me
too much, okay?

71
00:05:06,885 --> 00:05:10,321
But l saw this infomercial,
and l swear to you l have never, ever...

72
00:05:10,488 --> 00:05:12,718
...bought anything on TV before.

73
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,755
Except for this mop.

74
00:05:15,493 --> 00:05:17,893
But there was this stuff on leg-waxing.
lt looked so amazing.

75
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:19,121
Waxine!

76
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:20,730
Yes! Have you seen it?

77
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:23,559
lt's incredible!
l so want to be a Waxine Girl!

78
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:24,997
l know!

79
00:05:26,404 --> 00:05:29,840
Do you think it really doesn't hurt?
Because how can they do that?

80
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:33,444
Hello! Organic substances recently
discovered in the depths of the rain forest?

81
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:36,345
They have the best stuff in there.

82
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:39,115
Oh, my God!

83
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:41,885
Oh, my God!

84
00:05:42,787 --> 00:05:46,814
We figured when we couldn't find you,
you'd gone home to make up with Rachel.

85
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:49,222
Which is probably what
you should have done, huh?

86
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:52,162
You think?

87
00:05:53,298 --> 00:05:56,790
God, l'm in hell.
l mean, what am l gonna do?

88
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:59,801
Rachel's all like, ''l love you,''
and ''Let's work on this'' ...

89
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:01,438
...and all l can think about...

90
00:06:01,606 --> 00:06:04,131
...is what is she gonna do
when l tell her what l did?

91
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:08,106
Before we answer that, we should
address the more important question:

92
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:09,712
How dumb are you?

93
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:15,717
What? Look, we're trying to
rebuild a relationship here, right?

94
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:18,583
How am l supposed to do that
without being totally honest?

95
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:22,056
Ross, look, l'm onboard about
the total-honesty thing. l am.

96
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,957
Just not about stuff that's
gonna get you in trouble.

97
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:29,494
He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit,
and you're just gonna hurt her.

98
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:32,398
Yeah, and there won't be
a relationship left to rebuild.

99
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,662
Don't you think--?

100
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:37,535
Look, if you absolutely have to tell her,
at least wait till the timing's right.

101
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:39,574
And that's what deathbeds are for.

102
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:44,538
-Yeah, okay.
-All right.

103
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:49,912
Okay. Now, we just have to make sure
she doesn't find out some other way.

104
00:06:51,122 --> 00:06:53,352
Did you think about the trail?

105
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:56,284
What trail?

106
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:00,765
The trail from the woman
you did it with...

107
00:07:00,932 --> 00:07:03,958
...to the woman you hope
never finds out you did it!

108
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:06,637
You always have to think
about the trail!

109
00:07:08,473 --> 00:07:10,873
l don't think there's any trail.

110
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:15,042
Chloe works with that guy, lsaac.

111
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:19,411
lsaac's sister is Jasmine, and Jasmine
works at the massage place with Phoebe.

112
00:07:19,617 --> 00:07:22,609
And Phoebe's friends with Rachel,
and that's the trail! l did it!

113
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,459
''After applying the Waxine
and linen strips to leg number one--''

114
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,753
-Did that!
-Okay.

115
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:33,397
''Grasp one of the linen strips
by its easy-grab tab...

116
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,566
...and pull it off in one quick,
pain-free motion.''

117
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:42,598
Was it not ''pain-free''?

118
00:07:43,942 --> 00:07:45,739
No, it was pain-ful!

119
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:49,572
Oh, my God, they should call it
''Pain-zine, now with a little wax.''

120
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:53,140
The girls in the satin nighties
on the commercial...

121
00:07:53,318 --> 00:07:55,047
...don't seem to think it's that bad.

122
00:07:55,286 --> 00:07:58,414
That's because their nerves are
deadened from being so stupid.

123
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:04,323
But, hey, you know, if you don't
believe me, please, be my guest.

124
00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:08,526
Oh, my God!

125
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:12,161
Now aren't you glad we didn't
start with the bikini strips?

126
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:19,409
Chloe, hi.

127
00:08:20,145 --> 00:08:22,238
ls this about me taking your watch?

128
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:26,409
-You took my watch?
-l'm sorry. l do that.

129
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:30,744
You keep it. Listen, did you
tell anyone about us?

130
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:34,117
Oh, no. l feel like it really isn't
anybody's business, you know?

131
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:37,453
Exactly. So you didn't mention
anything to lsaac, right?

132
00:08:37,695 --> 00:08:41,426
-Oh, l tell lsaac everything.
-You do? Of course you do.

133
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:46,798
Hi, lsaac.
You know, we haven't actually met.

134
00:08:47,038 --> 00:08:48,630
You dog!

135
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:55,880
Yes, l suppose l am a dog.
But see, l happen to have a girlfriend.

136
00:08:56,047 --> 00:08:58,379
Oh, right, that Rachel chick
from the coffee place.

137
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,417
Yeah, that's the one.
Listen, l don't want to hurt her.

138
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:04,646
Oh, hey, man, l know. lt doesn't
matter how much we love them.

139
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:07,155
Monogamy is too cruel a rule.

140
00:09:09,094 --> 00:09:13,497
Yeah. Listen, can you keep this
information to yourself?

141
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:16,259
Oh, no problem, dude.
We gotta look out for each other.

142
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:18,163
We're the same, you and me.

143
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:23,867
Actually, no, we're not.

144
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:25,441
Yeah, we are.

145
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:27,840
No, we're not.

146
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:29,343
Yeah, we are.

147
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:31,708
No, we're not.

148
00:09:31,883 --> 00:09:34,215
-Okay, we're not.
-Right.

149
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:35,885
But we are.

150
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:41,592
Fine. l just need to know that
you're not gonna tell your sister.

151
00:09:42,393 --> 00:09:44,759
l can promise not to tell her again.

152
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,996
Jasmine? We met at Phoebe's
birthday party. l'm Ross Geller.

153
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:55,536
You did a bad thing!

154
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,342
-Yes, l did.
-Very bad!

155
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,475
-Very bad.
-Very, very bad!

156
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:02,741
l'm agreeing with you.

157
00:10:02,947 --> 00:10:05,507
Listen, did you happen
to tell Phoebe yet?

158
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:08,151
-No.
-Okay, Jasmine...

159
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:10,617
...please. Please don't.

160
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:12,312
l love my girlfriend very much...

161
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,153
...and l want more than anything
to just work it out with her, okay?

162
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:18,486
All right.

163
00:10:19,097 --> 00:10:20,621
Thank you. Thank you.

164
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:22,992
But you should probably talk
to my roommate.

165
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:24,897
l told him,
and he knows Phoebe too.

166
00:10:25,403 --> 00:10:26,597
Who's your roommate?

167
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:27,793
Gunther!

168
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:32,271
Gunther, please tell me
you didn't say anything to Rachel...

169
00:10:32,443 --> 00:10:34,468
...about me and the girl
from the copy place.

170
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:36,376
l'm sorry.

171
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:38,411
Was l not supposed to?

172
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,788
Okay, l got an idea. Why don't you
pull off mine, and l pull off yours?

173
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:59,259
Or, you pull of yours,
and l will leave mine on...

174
00:10:59,437 --> 00:11:02,167
...because l think
l can make this look work.

175
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:05,069
Come on, Phoebe. We can do this.

176
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:06,938
-All right.
-All right.

177
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:09,237
Okay.

178
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:15,986
-What is it?
-What's going on?

179
00:11:16,154 --> 00:11:19,282
-We're all right.
-lt's okay. lt's okay.

180
00:11:20,258 --> 00:11:22,852
-We were just waxing our legs.
-Off?

181
00:11:24,862 --> 00:11:26,090
For your information...

182
00:11:26,264 --> 00:11:29,256
...this happens to be a pain
like no man will ever experience.

183
00:11:29,434 --> 00:11:32,665
l don't think you can make that
statement unless you've been kicked...

184
00:11:32,837 --> 00:11:35,169
...in an area God only meant
to be treated nicely.

185
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:40,168
l think women just have a lower
threshold for pain than men, that's all.

186
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:43,006
l mean, come on,
it's just a little wax.

187
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:44,877
Oh, yeah? Come here.

188
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:48,450
Oh, that's mature.

189
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:52,179
Okay, fine.
So now what, l just pull it off?

190
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:53,790
That's right.

191
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:06,164
Okay, Tin Man.

192
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,006
Rachel, come on.
Talk to me. Please!

193
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:13,700
Talk to you?
l can't even look at you right now.

194
00:12:13,878 --> 00:12:15,175
What?

195
00:12:15,346 --> 00:12:17,007
Nothing. Nothing.

196
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:20,741
-Rachel said everything was okay.
-What are they talking about?

197
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:25,584
-Just get away from me!
-l made a mistake, okay?

198
00:12:25,757 --> 00:12:29,784
A mistake? What were you trying
to put it in? Her purse?

199
00:12:32,163 --> 00:12:34,256
Where did he put it?

200
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:39,663
Ross, you had sex with another woman!

201
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:41,897
Oh, my God!

202
00:12:42,073 --> 00:12:43,768
l knew something had to be wrong...

203
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:46,569
...because my fingernails
did not grow at all yesterday.

204
00:12:48,146 --> 00:12:50,944
Yeah, well, l guess they had a fight,
and he got drunk--

205
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,976
You guys knew about this
and you didn't tell us?

206
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:56,676
He has sex and we get hit
in our heads!

207
00:12:57,322 --> 00:12:59,756
Know what? l want you to leave!
Just get out! Now!

208
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:01,858
l want to stay.
l want to talk about this.

209
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:04,995
Okay. All right. How was she?

210
00:13:10,535 --> 00:13:12,127
-What?
-Was she good?

211
00:13:12,303 --> 00:13:13,361
Don't answer that.

212
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:20,166
You said you wanted to talk about it.
Let's talk about it. How was she?

213
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:23,011
-She was....
-Awful.

214
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:26,341
-She was not good.
-Horrible. Nothing compared to you.

215
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:29,277
She was different.

216
00:13:32,523 --> 00:13:34,013
Good different?

217
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:37,324
Nobody likes change.

218
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:40,987
-Just stop!
-What? Okay! Okay! Okay!

219
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,064
Should we do something?

220
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:45,495
Yeah. Never cheat on Rachel.

221
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:51,402
l'm sorry, okay? l'm sorry.
l was disgusted with myself...

222
00:13:51,676 --> 00:13:53,166
...and this morning
l was upset...

223
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:56,002
...and then l got your
message and l was so happy.

224
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:59,240
And all l wanted was to get her out
of my apartment--

225
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:02,419
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Wait a minute.

226
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:06,648
What time did your
little friend leave?

227
00:14:10,595 --> 00:14:13,428
Oh, my God. She was there?
She was still there?

228
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:16,826
She was in there when l was in there?

229
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:24,405
Listen, the important thing is,
she meant nothing to me.

230
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:28,270
And yet she was worth
jeopardizing our relationship!

231
00:14:29,914 --> 00:14:32,075
l didn't think there was
a relationship.

232
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,650
-l thought we were broken up.
-We were on a break.

233
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:38,414
That, for all l knew, could last forever.
That, to me, is a breakup.

234
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:40,648
You gonna get out of this
on a technicality?

235
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:42,918
l'm not trying to ''get out''
of anything, okay?

236
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:44,924
l thought our relationship was dead.

237
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:49,088
Well, you sure had a hell of a time
at the wake.

238
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:53,101
You know what? l don't think
we should listen to this anymore.

239
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:55,205
What are you doing?
We can't go out there.

240
00:14:55,373 --> 00:14:57,637
Why not? l'm hungry.

241
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,735
Because they'll know
we've been listening.

242
00:15:02,113 --> 00:15:04,980
God! And to have to hear about it
from Gunther!

243
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:06,582
Like l wanted him to tell you?

244
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,050
l ran all over the place trying
to make sure that didn't happen!

245
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:13,214
Oh, that is so sweet.

246
00:15:14,926 --> 00:15:17,724
l think l'm falling in love with you
all over again.

247
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:23,567
l think we can go out. They have
more important things to worry about.

248
00:15:23,768 --> 00:15:24,894
We'll be fine.

249
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:28,561
Look, Rachel, l wanted to tell you.
l thought l should. l did.

250
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,469
And then Chandler and Joey
convinced me not to!

251
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:38,809
Wax the door shut.
We're never leaving.

252
00:15:40,351 --> 00:15:44,185
Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen, someone has
to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehak...

253
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:47,414
...because it's 9:1 5 now,
and l'm not there.

254
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:53,388
No, l'm in the middle
of a huge relationship fight, so....

255
00:15:53,564 --> 00:15:55,725
Oh, that's all right.
lt's not mine.

256
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,892
Don't you realize none of this would
ever have happened if l didn't think...

257
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:02,471
...at that same moment
you were having sex with Mark?

258
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,766
All right.

259
00:16:04,475 --> 00:16:09,003
Let's say l had slept with Mark. Would
you have been able to forgive me?

260
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:13,246
Yes, l would.

261
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:17,018
You'd be okay if you knew...

262
00:16:17,188 --> 00:16:19,986
...that Mark had kissed me,
and been naked with me...

263
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:21,749
...and made love to me?

264
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:24,387
Yes.

265
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:29,331
lf you knew that our hot, sweaty,
writhing bodies were--

266
00:16:33,971 --> 00:16:37,532
Okay, okay.
Yeah, l would have been devastated...

267
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:40,407
...but l would still want
to be with you.

268
00:16:40,978 --> 00:16:43,469
Because, l mean, it's you.

269
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:54,186
What?

270
00:16:55,192 --> 00:16:57,854
Come on, Rachel,
tell me what you're thinking.

271
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:02,327
l'm thinking...

272
00:17:05,102 --> 00:17:07,002
...l'm gonna order a pizza.

273
00:17:10,274 --> 00:17:11,866
Order a pizza, like...

274
00:17:12,977 --> 00:17:14,706
...''l forgive you''?

275
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:20,975
Oh, man!

276
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:22,610
Pizza?

277
00:17:23,854 --> 00:17:25,378
l like pizza.

278
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:29,288
Put olives on the pizza.

279
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:36,664
We could eat the wax! lt's organic!

280
00:17:37,868 --> 00:17:40,029
Oh, great. Food with hair on it.

281
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:43,567
No, not the used wax.

282
00:17:43,841 --> 00:17:46,139
Because that would be crazy?

283
00:17:49,113 --> 00:17:52,947
Could l get in on that?
Because l'm kind of hungry myself.

284
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:54,446
Fine.

285
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:57,213
Hi, yes, l'd like to order
a large pizza.

286
00:17:57,588 --> 00:18:00,785
-No anchovies.
-With extra anchovies.

287
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:03,149
That's okay.
l'll pick them off.

288
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:06,660
And could you please chop some up
and just put it right in the sauce?

289
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:15,496
You can have the last piece
if you want.

290
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,573
Well, l should think so.
You slept with someone.

291
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:33,716
They're gonna get through this,
aren't they?

292
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,889
Yeah. Come on, it's Ross and Rachel.

293
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:38,153
They've got to.

294
00:18:40,064 --> 00:18:41,497
What if they don't?

295
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,134
You think l need a new walk?

296
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,467
What?

297
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:56,443
Well, you know, l've been walking
the same way since high school.

298
00:18:56,814 --> 00:19:00,614
You know how some guys walk into
a room and everybody takes notice?

299
00:19:00,885 --> 00:19:02,944
l think l need a take-notice walk.

300
00:19:03,821 --> 00:19:05,914
Are you actually saying these words?

301
00:19:10,928 --> 00:19:13,328
What, now you're not even
talking to me?

302
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:20,601
Look, Rachel, l'm sorry.
l'm sorry. l was out of my mind.

303
00:19:20,838 --> 00:19:22,305
l thought l'd lost you.

304
00:19:22,473 --> 00:19:25,465
How insane must l have been
to do something like this?

305
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:29,770
l don't cheat, right?
That's not me. l'm not Joey!

306
00:19:34,218 --> 00:19:35,947
Yeah, okay.

307
00:19:38,723 --> 00:19:40,020
Hey!

308
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:43,820
lt's 3 in the morning. They don't
know that l've come home yet.

309
00:19:43,994 --> 00:19:47,623
You notice how neither one of them
are wondering where l am?

310
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:51,131
Yeah, you know, people
can be so self-involved.

311
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,463
You know what? l'm not the one
that wanted that break, okay?

312
00:19:56,707 --> 00:19:59,369
You're the one that bailed on us.
You're the one...

313
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:01,773
...that ran the moment things
got a little rough.

314
00:20:01,946 --> 00:20:03,140
-That's--
-That's what?

315
00:20:03,314 --> 00:20:05,908
-That is neither here nor there.
-Here we are...

316
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,345
...in a tough spot again.
What do you want?

317
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:12,216
How do you want to handle it?
You want to fight for us or bail?

318
00:20:18,162 --> 00:20:22,155
Look, l did a terrible,
stupid, stupid thing, okay?

319
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:26,193
And l'm sorry. l wish l could
take it back, but l can't.

320
00:20:26,604 --> 00:20:30,665
l just can't see us throwing away
something we know is so damn good.

321
00:20:31,675 --> 00:20:33,802
Rachel, l love you so much.

322
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:46,315
No, Ross! Don't!

323
00:20:46,524 --> 00:20:49,891
You can't just kiss me and think
you're gonna make it all go away.

324
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:52,994
lt doesn't work that way.
lt doesn't just make it better.

325
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:54,495
Okay. Okay.

326
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:01,004
l think you should go.

327
00:21:02,473 --> 00:21:03,497
What?

328
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:06,735
l really think you need to go now.

329
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,408
Okay. Okay.

330
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:15,352
This morning you said there was nothing
so big we couldn't work past it.

331
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,077
What the hell did l know?

332
00:21:17,354 --> 00:21:20,346
There's got to be a way we
can work past this.

333
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:25,221
l can't imagine my life without you.
You know? Without....

334
00:21:27,765 --> 00:21:29,027
Without these arms...

335
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,762
...and your face and heart...

336
00:21:32,937 --> 00:21:34,928
...your good heart, Rach, and....

337
00:21:39,643 --> 00:21:40,905
No.

338
00:21:41,712 --> 00:21:44,909
l can't. You're a totally
different person to me now.

339
00:21:45,516 --> 00:21:50,579
l used to think of you as somebody
that would never, ever hurt me.

340
00:21:50,855 --> 00:21:51,947
Ever.

341
00:21:53,624 --> 00:21:55,990
God, and now l can't stop
picturing you with her.

342
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,755
l can't. lt doesn't matter what you
say or what you do.

343
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,726
lt's just changed everything.

344
00:22:05,102 --> 00:22:06,831
Forever.

345
00:22:17,715 --> 00:22:19,205
This can't be it.

346
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:26,715
Then how come it is?

347
00:22:37,968 --> 00:22:40,528
They've been quiet for a long time.

348
00:22:41,438 --> 00:22:42,564
Maybe she killed him.

349
00:22:46,844 --> 00:22:48,106
Let's go.

350
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:17,735
ls that your new walk?

351
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:24,506
No. l really have to pee.
