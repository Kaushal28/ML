1
00:00:11,961 --> 00:00:13,519
You look cute in bubbles.

2
00:00:13,797 --> 00:00:16,163
You're just all liquored up.

3
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:21,361
Hey, it's me. I'm coming in.

4
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:30,869
I've had a very long, hard day.

5
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:36,346
-You're home early.
-Yeah, my date threw up.

6
00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:38,918
Want some chicken?

7
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,148
No, thanks. No chicken.
Bye-bye.

8
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:45,493
You sure?
Some extra-crispy, dirty rice?

9
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:48,061
For the last time, no!
Get out, Joey!

10
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:49,663
All right.

11
00:00:53,837 --> 00:00:55,634
Are you okay?
He wouldn't leave.

12
00:00:55,905 --> 00:00:58,305
He kept asking me if I wanted chicken.

13
00:00:58,608 --> 00:00:59,768
Chicken?

14
00:01:01,077 --> 00:01:02,669
I could eat some chicken.

15
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:12,946
Could I get a three-piece,
some coleslaw, some beans and a Coke?

16
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:14,656
Diet Coke.

17
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,425
The One With All the Kissing

18
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:01,669
-Morning, Phoebe.
-I have to tell you this story.

19
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,169
I was coming over
and this cabdriver

20
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:05,499
Was his name Angus?

21
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:08,167
What?

22
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:10,675
He was a cabdriver
we had in London.

23
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:14,309
All right. Anyway

24
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,815
What was that pub he took us to?

25
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,213
The Wheat Sheaf!

26
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:20,046
And they had that beer....

27
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:21,883
Boddington's!

28
00:02:25,094 --> 00:02:27,221
Phoebe was going to tell a story.

29
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,160
So he had a really funny hat.

30
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:32,697
I don't want to talk about it.

31
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:36,268
-Hey.
-Hey, Ross!

32
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:38,503
Boddington's!

33
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,174
Oh, man!

34
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:45,609
I'd walk back to London for another
frosty one of those bad boys.

35
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:48,908
They have them at the
British pub by the Trade Center.

36
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:50,584
Later!

37
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:53,212
Shouldn't Rachel be back?

38
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:54,923
Her plane got delayed.

39
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:56,954
But she should be here by now.

40
00:02:57,193 --> 00:02:59,923
So you talked to her?
Did she sound mad?

41
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:02,092
No. But she likes me.

42
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,196
You abandoned her
on a plane to Greece.

43
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,302
I did not "abandon" Rachel. Okay?

44
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:10,436
Emily showed up at the airport.

45
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,734
I had to go after her.
I did what I had to do.

46
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:16,445
She's my wife.
Rachel is my wife.

47
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:17,873
Emily!

48
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:22,479
Emily is my wife.

49
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:24,986
Man, what is that?

50
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:27,920
You haven't heard from Emily?

51
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,217
Not since I lost her at the airport.

52
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,451
I can't believe she can outrun you.

53
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:35,220
Hey! She's fast, okay?

54
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:39,393
You think you can beat me?
Let's go! Outside!

55
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:44,569
-I'm sorry. I'm just a little
-Slow?

56
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:46,606
Oh, you want some?!

57
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:50,007
Okay, get the shoes on! Let's go, man!

58
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:52,044
It's cool, okay?

59
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:54,615
You're the fastest!

60
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:58,348
-Hi!
-Oh, my God, Rachel!

61
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:04,118
Rach, I am so sorry.
I am so, so sorry.

62
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:06,885
Come on.
You just did what you had to do.

63
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:12,800
That's it? You're not mad?
It must've been terrible.

64
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,061
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece!

65
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:20,005
There was a nice hotel, nice beach,
met the nice people.

66
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:22,473
It's not too shabby for Rachel.

67
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:27,175
So, what, that's it?

68
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:31,480
We're cool. Totally cool.

69
00:04:32,255 --> 00:04:33,984
Thanks, Rach.
You're the best.

70
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,522
Oh, no. You're the best.

71
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:40,588
Oh, I got to go to the flower store.

72
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,159
No one will tell me where Emily is...

73
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,530
...so I'm sending 72 long-stemmed, red
roses to her parents' house.

74
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:51,706
One for each day
I've known and loved her.

75
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:53,569
That should get her talking.

76
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:58,110
When you make out the card,
be sure to make it out to "Emily."

77
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:05,585
It's good that you had
such a good time in Greece.

78
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:07,915
What?

79
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,857
I didn't have a good time in Greece!

80
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:14,790
Ross abandoned me!

81
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:19,229
I couldn't get a plane out.
I had to stay in their suite!

82
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:24,406
People came up to me going,
"Mrs. Geller! Why are you cry?"

83
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:28,106
I mean, it was so humiliating!

84
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:30,438
I felt like such an idiot!

85
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:32,978
It's all my fault.
You know why?

86
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:36,583
Because I make very bad decisions.

87
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:37,980
Oh, that's not true.

88
00:05:38,287 --> 00:05:41,723
Yes, it is true.
I went after Ross in stupid London!

89
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,756
London is stupid! Stupid!

90
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:49,327
I put on a cheerleading outfit
to seduce Joshua.

91
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:54,163
Then I lost him because I asked him
to marry me after four dates.

92
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:58,671
And then I went to Greece
on somebody else's honeymoon. Okay?

93
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:02,140
Do those sound like very good
decisions to you?

94
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:04,806
I like your little braid.

95
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:07,742
I just shouldn't be allowed
to make decisions anymore.

96
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:10,579
Phoebe, you were right.
I should've never gone to London.

97
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,153
From now on, you make
all my decisions for me.

98
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:16,814
Oh, no.
I did that for someone once.

99
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,019
I'm not comfortable having
that power over someone's life.

100
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,595
I'll do it.

101
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,796
Fine. Monica, you are now
in charge of my love life.

102
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:30,767
Okay. I got to go to work.

103
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,445
And Rachel, great to have you back.

104
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:57,096
Always a pleasure.

105
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:08,100
Rachel? Sweetie, look.

106
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:10,779
Here's a cute picture of you and Joey.

107
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,275
He's married.

108
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,416
Ross is married.
I still can't believe it.

109
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:18,315
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.

110
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:20,717
I'll just have to accept it.

111
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:22,584
I mean, it's my fault.

112
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:25,184
Edges! Fingers! Smudgy!

113
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:27,362
Oh, my God!

114
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:35,467
That's okay. I know that
you're very upset right now.

115
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:37,468
I know that wasn't about me.

116
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:39,764
I bet it was about her a little.

117
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,507
If you'd stop thinking about Ross...

118
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,613
...you'd notice there are
great guys everywhere.

119
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:46,940
Look. Gunther.

120
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:51,444
He's nice. He's cute.

121
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:54,013
Yeah. I guess Gunther is....

122
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:56,257
What about that guy over there?

123
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,258
That's the guy you flirted with
at the counter.

124
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:04,825
-Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
-You're going to talk to him.

125
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:08,696
I make your decisions,
and I say you're going to talk to him.

126
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,799
All right.

127
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,170
You're the boss.
I got to do what you tell me.

128
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:16,638
Say that to him, and you're golden.

129
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:25,619
Hey, Phoebe.
We got our pictures back from London.

130
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,551
Here's all of us
at the Tower of London....

131
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,652
Here we all are.

132
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:33,618
There's Ross and Joey and you and

133
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:36,188
And me.

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,298
We've been talking about
London too much.

135
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:43,567
Sorry, it's just because
I couldn't be there.

136
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:47,331
All I get to do now is pregnant stuff.
It bums me out.

137
00:08:47,543 --> 00:08:49,010
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

138
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:52,476
Know what I like to do?
It sounds a little corny...

139
00:08:52,648 --> 00:08:55,845
...but sometimes when I'm bummed out,
I like to just close my eyes...

140
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:58,612
...and think about
what a wonderful gift life is.

141
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:08,354
See?

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,094
-What happened?
-A little of this, a little of that.

143
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,997
I got myself a date tomorrow.

144
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:20,264
See? Didn't I tell you?
You're getting over Ross already.

145
00:09:21,877 --> 00:09:22,866
Get out.

146
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:39,950
What took so long?

147
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:43,528
I got caught up at work.
But I'm quitting tomorrow.

148
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:50,732
So thanks for having me over.

149
00:10:08,758 --> 00:10:10,248
See you, man.

150
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:15,059
What the hell was that?

151
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:19,897
Probably some European
goodbye thing he picked up in London.

152
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:21,727
That's not European.

153
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:24,163
It felt French.

154
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:30,405
Well, I guess it's time for me
to say goodbye too, mon frere.

155
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:34,674
Come here and give me a little sugar.

156
00:10:40,856 --> 00:10:42,653
I really had a good time.

157
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,257
Yeah, me too.

158
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,888
I guess this is it.

159
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:53,593
Unless you want to come inside?

160
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:59,903
Wait a minute. You know what?
I can't decide this.

161
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:04,245
Okay. Just hold on a second.

162
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,320
Where's Monica?
I have to ask her something.

163
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:14,921
Doing her laundry.

164
00:11:15,524 --> 00:11:16,752
What's that?

165
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,619
It came in the mail today.

166
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:23,397
It's 72 long-stemmed red roses.

167
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,534
One for each day
I've known and loved Emily...

168
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:28,897
...cut up into mulch.

169
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,635
Honey, that's awful.

170
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,765
It's not so bad.

171
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:37,411
Monica's going to make potpourri.

172
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:44,883
I think I'm going to go
wander out in the rain for a while.

173
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:46,111
It's not raining.

174
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:48,880
I can't catch a break!

175
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,557
You're not going anywhere.
Sit right here.

176
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:56,889
I'll make you some tea
and we'll talk this out.

177
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,258
All right?

178
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:03,265
Hey, Dave.

179
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:08,065
I need to take a rain check.
My roommate is really sick.

180
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,299
Okay. Bye!

181
00:12:13,082 --> 00:12:14,572
Honey, listen.

182
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,411
I know things seem so
bad...

183
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:20,953
...and that they won't get any

184
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:23,015
Could I talk to you?

185
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,018
I dropped some socks.

186
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:40,437
What is the matter with you?
Do you want to fall into the trap?

187
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,474
You did not drop any socks!

188
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:45,974
I saw Dave, and he said
you blew him off!

189
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:47,137
You listen to me!

190
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:51,285
I'm calling the shots!
I say you leave Ross and go get Dave.

191
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:52,613
What are you doing?

192
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:56,815
Well, ultimately I was trying,
you know, I wanted...

193
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,287
...to tell him that
I'm still in love with him.

194
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:03,655
What? You cannot tell him that!

195
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,230
Why? Why not?

196
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:07,527
People love to hear that!

197
00:13:08,437 --> 00:13:10,098
Come on, I love you.

198
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:12,001
-Wasn't that nice?
-No.

199
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:14,506
I make the decisions and I say no!

200
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:18,272
You know what? No, you don't
make my decisions, because...

201
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:19,946
...you're fired.

202
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:21,943
You can't fire me.

203
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:26,712
I make your decisions,
and I say I'm not fired! Ha!

204
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,118
Well....

205
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:41,867
Come on, let me in!

206
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:43,594
Having some trouble?

207
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:46,138
Rachel locked the door.

208
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,367
I'll kick that door in
if you give me some sugar.

209
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,045
Ross, there's something
I wanna talk to you about.

210
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:58,709
-I just need to
-Rachel, open this door!

211
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:02,187
-What, is it locked?
-She's fine. Listen....

212
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:05,016
Rachel, I can do this all night if I have to!

213
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:07,754
-You want me to get that?
-No. Just let her do her thing...

214
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,457
...and we'll do our thing.
Because I really need to tell you

215
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:19,899
Thank you.

216
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,406
Rachel? Can I talk to you
outside for a sec?

217
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:29,812
We really need to talk.

218
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,552
Well, then talk.

219
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:33,813
Okay, I will.

220
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:40,989
Remember that thing we just discussed
that you wanted to do?

221
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,488
What thing?

222
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:48,626
Rachel wants to take
swing dance lessons.

223
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,830
Which I think is a really stupid idea.

224
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:55,167
It's dangerous.
She won't get what she wants.

225
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:58,403
And who knows who she might
end up hurting?

226
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:08,120
Monica's right.
Swing dancing can be tricky.

227
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:11,589
I have to use the phone.

228
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,762
I gotta cancel those five giant
teddy bears I sent to Emily.

229
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:18,465
My God! Think of the massacre.

230
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:20,762
I'm going to do it.

231
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,800
I know you think I'm crazy.

232
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,133
But before you tell him,
try to find one person...

233
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,674
...who thinks it's a good idea.
I bet you can't.

234
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:29,969
Please?

235
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:33,511
All right. Fine.

236
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:39,953
Joey! I'm in!

237
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,282
All right. Good deal.

238
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:51,999
-Hi.
-Hey, Rach.

239
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:54,692
-Did you find anyone who agrees with you?
-No.

240
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,431
But you know what?
I think I need a male point of view.

241
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,065
Joey.

242
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:06,413
-You're a man.
-You got that right.

243
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:10,751
Do you think it would be a good idea
if I told Ross that I was still in love with him?

244
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,045
Nope.

245
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:17,117
-Phoebe!
-Hey, Phoebe.

246
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:22,623
-Phoebe?
-Yeah.

247
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:26,290
You know how you were saying
you didn't get to go to London...

248
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:28,366
...and you were feeling left out?

249
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,403
Well, we all felt really bad
about that...

250
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:35,074
...so we decided to
take a little trip together!

251
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:37,479
Oh, that's so nice!

252
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,509
How great!
Where's the trip?

253
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:43,246
Well, we thought we would all
go to a picnic...

254
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:45,584
...in Central Park!

255
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:47,345
Central Park?

256
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:49,715
All of us. All day.

257
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:51,349
That sucks!

258
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:54,992
That's not a trip!
I just came from there.

259
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,197
What'll we high-five about
at the stupid park?

260
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,367
It's right by my house.
All right!

261
00:17:03,205 --> 00:17:07,164
I'm going home to bask in the
triumph of my Central Park idea.

262
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:10,402
Hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissy.

263
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:13,943
I wanted to talk to you about...

264
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:17,380
...this whole new European thing
you've got going on.

265
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:20,714
And I need to say
it makes me very uncomfortable...

266
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,424
...and I just, you know, just stop it!

267
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:27,127
Just bringing some culture
to the group.

268
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:30,259
That's fine.
Just don't bring it in my mouth.

269
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,763
It makes me want to puke.

270
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:42,107
Hey, everybody!
Phoebe is here!

271
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,206
-Phoebe! Woo!
-Okay. Woo! Hi!

272
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:52,149
Phoebe, we decided that
the picnic idea was a little....

273
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:54,753
It didn't have any....
Well, it blew.

274
00:17:57,226 --> 00:18:01,720
We thought that this afternoon we'd
all go away for the whole weekend...

275
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,261
...to Atlantic City.

276
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:07,902
Atlantic City! Oh, that's
a great plan! Whose plan was that?

277
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,059
Mine!

278
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:13,064
-Wait. It was my plan.
-No...

279
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:15,640
...I said we needed a new plan.

280
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:17,902
And I came up with Atlantic City.

281
00:18:18,113 --> 00:18:20,138
Which is the new plan.

282
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:25,620
Why don't we all
meet upstairs in an hour.

283
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:30,914
I'm going to go pack.
I'm going to go pack my ass off.

284
00:18:32,728 --> 00:18:37,028
Well, I think I'm gonna grab some coffee
because my ass is already packed.

285
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:42,092
Let's go.

286
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:44,828
You know what?
I'll meet you in a minute.

287
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:49,003
Rachel, you didn't find anyone,
so you can't tell him.

288
00:18:49,278 --> 00:18:51,371
You know what?
That doesn't matter.

289
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:56,280
Do you know how painful it is
to tell someone you love them...

290
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:58,315
...and not have them say it back?

291
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:02,120
I don't care.

292
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:07,656
I can't watch.

293
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:23,977
What you reading?

294
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,369
Paper.

295
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:28,345
Yeah? What's it about?

296
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,015
Events from around the globe.

297
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:40,855
There's something
I have to talk to you about.

298
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:42,724
Everyone's saying I shouldn't.

299
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:45,865
But I think they're wrong.
People can be wrong.

300
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:47,729
Once at work...

301
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:50,597
...I thought carbon dating
is fossilized

302
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:53,569
I'm really trying to tell
you something here.

303
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,373
Go ahead.

304
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:01,076
I think I'm just going to say it.

305
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,749
I'm just going to say it.

306
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:15,322
I'm still in love with you, Ross.

307
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:33,647
I'm not sure what to do
with that right now.

308
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:42,289
What? Was that a joke?
Because it's mean.

309
00:20:45,027 --> 00:20:47,222
I'm so dead serious!

310
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,353
I'm totally serious!

311
00:20:49,564 --> 00:20:50,861
Why are you laughing?

312
00:20:53,535 --> 00:20:55,526
Because I just heard it!

313
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:57,795
I heard it. And it's ridiculous!

314
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,166
I mean....

315
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:00,634
You're married!

316
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:03,342
You're married,
and it's just ridiculous!

317
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:07,070
When I said it, I sort of
floated up out of my body.

318
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:12,082
And then I heard myself say it,
and then the floating Rachel....

319
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:18,223
I was like, "You are such an idiot!"

320
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:24,856
-Well, I am married.
-I know.

321
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,660
Though I haven't spoken to her
since the wedding.

322
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:34,369
I'm sorry. That's not funny.

323
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:38,837
Actually, it kind of is.

324
00:21:41,516 --> 00:21:43,609
My wife won't return my calls.

325
00:21:46,955 --> 00:21:49,185
I don't know where my wife is.

326
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:55,624
"Hey, Ross! Where's the missus?"
"Don't know!"

327
00:21:57,933 --> 00:21:59,264
Oh, God!

328
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,401
You know what?
Could you forget I told you this?

329
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,134
Well, I kind of have to.

330
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,209
Because the thing is

331
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:16,145
The thing is, you know,
that you're married to Emily.

332
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,888
That is what the thing is.

333
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:26,760
Oh, God.

334
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:31,930
Things won't be weird between us,
right? Was that stupid?

335
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:33,498
Me telling you that?

336
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:35,900
I'm glad you did.

337
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:39,230
If nothing else...

338
00:22:39,474 --> 00:22:42,671
...it's always great when someone
tells you they love you.

339
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:45,135
That's what I said!

340
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:51,515
-Thank you for being so nice.
-No. Thank you for....

341
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:54,186
Thank you.

342
00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:00,419
Oh, God. I'm just glad I didn't give you
the cassette I made of all of our songs.

343
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:02,893
-What songs?
-Oh, you know:

344
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:05,863
-"With or Without You."
-Oh, yeah.

345
00:23:06,034 --> 00:23:08,366
-"Everybody Hurts."
-Oh, yeah.

346
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:11,131
-"Rhiannon."
-Why "Rhiannon"?

347
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:15,265
Come on, you remember!
In the living room?

348
00:23:15,744 --> 00:23:18,372
On Monica's laundry?

349
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:21,777
Not me.

350
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,779
Really.

351
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,020
So, what happened?

352
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:34,389
Well, it was really hard...

353
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:37,123
...but I'm glad I did it.

354
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:38,994
So was I right or wrong?

355
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:43,570
-Oh, come on, honey, does it really matter?
-No.

356
00:23:43,738 --> 00:23:46,571
Yes. I need it for my score book.

357
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:48,504
Diary.

358
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,578
-Okay, let's go!
-Yeah, Atlantic City!

359
00:23:52,747 --> 00:23:54,180
Come on!

360
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,340
Atlantic City, baby!

361
00:23:57,652 --> 00:23:59,347
Let's roll some bones.
Hey, Joey!

362
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,148
High-five for rolling bones.

363
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:08,119
Phoebe, you're leaking.

364
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:10,287
Oh, my God! Your water broke!

365
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:12,467
Oh, okay.

366
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:15,164
Well, don't worry. I call shotgun.

367
00:24:16,638 --> 00:24:19,573
Phoebe, we have to take you
to the hospital now.

368
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:23,040
Okay. Well, there's probably
one on the way to Atlantic City.

369
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,408
Phoebe, the babies are coming now.

370
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:29,141
Honey! High-five!
The babies are coming!

371
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,084
Remember when my water broke?

372
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,521
I can't believe Phoebe's going
to have her babies!

373
00:24:40,695 --> 00:24:43,027
I know.
It's beautiful and amazing.

374
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:54,235
I can't believe I had to kiss Phoebe
and Rachel every time I left the room.

375
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,640
It's too bad they didn't
see us having sex.

376
00:24:58,113 --> 00:25:00,274
Do you know anything about women?

377
00:25:02,817 --> 00:25:04,444
-It's all right.
-Okay.
