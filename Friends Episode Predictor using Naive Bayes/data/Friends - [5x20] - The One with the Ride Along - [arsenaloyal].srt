1
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:04,566
Okay, guys, listen.

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,363
Tomorrow, Emily gets married again.

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:10,405
So try to really keep
Ross' mind off of it.

4
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:11,942
Good idea.

5
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,739
Hey, man. What's up?

6
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:17,744
Just thinking about Emily
getting married tomorrow.

7
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:22,244
Oh, Ross! Look, look!

8
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:25,248
What? Where?

9
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,120
Right over there! There!
Look, look, look!

10
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,464
-What am I looking at?
-Somebody help me out here.

11
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,455
Hey!

12
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:39,105
Monica, sorry I didn't come by.
I was out with Gary.

13
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,775
He let me ride around with him.
We saw and prevented crimes.

14
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,102
You got to go on a ride-along?

15
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,780
-I want to go on a ride-along!
-Me too!

16
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,643
-Okay.
-Yeah! Me too!

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,440
Really? You?

18
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,877
Yeah.

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,448
-Well, it's kind of dangerous.
-Well, I like danger.

20
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,159
-Okay, you guys free tonight?
-Yeah!

21
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,564
You didn't say
it was gonna be at nighttime.

22
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:14,038
The One With the Ride-Along

23
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,250
I'm so glad you're home.
We can finally organize these photos.

24
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,490
Oh, thank God!

25
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:05,919
Finally!

26
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,761
I've broken them down
into categories.

27
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,864
We got holidays,
birthdays, candids....

28
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,398
And I've cross-referenced
them by subject.

29
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,627
So if you're looking up, say...

30
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:20,770
...birthdays and dogs,
you get photo 152.

31
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:21,963
See?

32
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,870
Oh, it's me and LePoo.

33
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,379
Wow, I miss that dog.

34
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,550
You can also find him
under "dog" and "dead."

35
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,809
Great. Thanks.

36
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:38,888
Hand me that other box of photos.
That's the last one.

37
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:45,957
Oops.

38
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,792
Sorry.

39
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,832
Good thing you numbered them.

40
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,025
I hadn't.

41
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,068
Photo 152 was a prototype.

42
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,667
Honey, it's okay. It's okay.

43
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,107
How about I fix you a drink?
Maybe a margarita?

44
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,138
Ross has the blender.

45
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,746
Everything's just falling apart.

46
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,588
It's okay. I'll go to Ross',
get the blender.

47
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,248
-You get the margarita stuff ready.
-All right.

48
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,292
His keys are in the drawer.
Also, I need some cash.

49
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,860
Want me to stop at the ATM?

50
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,430
No. While you're at Ross',
if you see any lying around.

51
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,300
-What?
-What?

52
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,462
I don't do that.

53
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:41,217
That was so cool, man.
The way you leaned on that guy.

54
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,945
It is starting to get dark out there.

55
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,285
He told you everything.
You cracked him.

56
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,826
He was the victim.
They're usually pretty talkative.

57
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,557
Okay, but it is officially nighttime.

58
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:59,161
-Want me to grab the berry for you?
-It's called a cherry.

59
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,203
It's called
Chandler!

60
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,907
Okay, I got it.

61
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:12,409
This place makes the
best sandwich in the world.

62
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,380
Does it have meatballs?

63
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,576
Oh, yeah.

64
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,416
Melted cheese and marinara sauce?

65
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:18,713
Yep.

66
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,889
You can't eat that in my car.

67
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,321
Yeah, okay.

68
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,158
Even though my tax dollars
paid for this car.

69
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,260
Your tax dollars?

70
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,039
Yeah, okay.

71
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,106
Wow, that sandwich smells good.

72
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,215
Did I say you could smell it?

73
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,549
I can't smell it?

74
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:53,392
Half the taste is in the smell.
You're sucking up all the taste units.

75
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,088
Okay, I'll give them back.

76
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,892
What is so great about that sandwich?

77
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,135
Imagine the best sex you ever had.

78
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,601
-Are you thinking about Monica?
-Yeah.

79
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:09,930
What's that like?

80
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,451
Please don't be from a real dinosaur.
Please, please.

81
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,420
Please, please.

82
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,829
"Made in Mexico."
Yes!

83
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,061
Who would buy this?

84
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,171
Rach, it's me. Pick up!

85
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,837
What's up?

86
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,084
I need a few more things
for the margaritas.

87
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:56,812
I need some salt,
some margarita mix and tequila.

88
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,425
So all we had was ice?

89
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,192
See if he has ice.

90
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,299
Hello, Ross?

91
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,977
It's Emily here.

92
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:23,274
I know this is out of the blue,
but I'm getting married tomorrow.

93
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,383
Well, maybe I am....

94
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,619
I keep thinking about you.

95
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:32,017
And I'm wondering if we made
a mistake giving up so fast.

96
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,886
Are you thinking about me?

97
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,852
No, of course you're not.
But if you are, call me tonight.

98
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,793
Okay, bye.

99
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,030
Where we going?

100
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,542
This witness won't return my calls.
We'll surprise him coming home.

101
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:57,409
Surprise him? We're not gonna
make anybody mad, are we?

102
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,511
Come on, man.

103
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:03,985
You gonna squeeze the perp's shoes
a bit before he lawyers up?

104
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,851
He's a witness, not a perp.
And no one talks like that.

105
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,885
Yeah. No one talks like that.

106
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,827
-Oh, what, like you're Mr. Cop?
-I'm more cop than you two.

107
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,694
How do you figure that?

108
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,167
I'm in the front seat, okay?

109
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,770
I'm Gary's partner.

110
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:25,170
When you say "partner,"
it doesn't sound cop.

111
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,072
It sounds gay.

112
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,208
Jealous.

113
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,216
-Hey, we're undercover here.
-Oh, yeah. No problem.

114
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,287
-Ross!
-Sorry.

115
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,585
There.

116
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,526
Hey, Gary. Who am l?

117
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,426
Phone home.

118
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,898
Look at Officer Ross riding
back here with the visitors.

119
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,742
What's up with that, Serpico?

120
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,079
"What's up with that, Serpico?"

121
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,081
Are you thinking about me?
No, of course you're not.

122
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,344
But if you are, call me tonight.

123
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,216
Okay, bye.

124
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,358
No.

125
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,459
I know!

126
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:22,094
Thank God you were here.
We have to erase that.

127
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,130
What? We can't do that.

128
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,429
We have to.
What if Ross hears that...

129
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,800
...and calls her back and
they get back together?

130
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,033
Is that what you want?
Ross back with that controlling...

131
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,714
...neurotic, crazy Emily?
The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?

132
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,979
No! Oh, no, no.

133
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,811
God, no! He should not
get back with her.

134
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:44,579
I know that, you know that.
Even Ross knows that.

135
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,088
But we have no right
to erase his message.

136
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,922
Look, I'm his sister and I love him.
I don't want to see him get hurt.

137
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,291
Doesn't that give me
the right to control him?

138
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,927
Help him?

139
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,136
He's not the one who needs help.

140
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,937
She's obviously unstable.

141
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,578
She's thinking about running
out on her wedding day.

142
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:15,843
Okay, fine. But look at the
position she's putting him in.

143
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,250
And what's he gonna do?

144
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,517
Run over there on the wedding day
and break up the marriage?

145
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,625
Who would do that?

146
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,861
Okay, fine. All right.
But that was different.

147
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,467
Although it did involve
a lot of the same people.

148
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:38,176
This is some twisted joke
she's playing on him.

149
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:41,540
You are crazy.
She sounded genuinely upset.

150
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,009
I mean, listen.

151
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,546
Your messages have been erased.

152
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,445
No!

153
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,755
Well, that worked out well. Margarita?

154
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,861
Okay, but we're safe, right?
Nothing bad's gonna go down.

155
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,400
No. But that reminds me.
Sign this.

156
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,728
What is it?

157
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,667
It just says you can't sue
if you scrape your knee...

158
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,535
...or get your head blown off.

159
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,013
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.

160
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,071
Here he comes.

161
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,915
What is he doing?
What the hell is he doing?

162
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,142
What is it?

163
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,811
-ls everything okay?
-What?

164
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,389
He sees us. Don't move.
And don't look at him!

165
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,610
Hey, it's okay.
It was just a car backfire.

166
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,442
Hey, look at that.
You tried to save your buddy.

167
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:51,842
You see that?

168
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,779
You see what he did?

169
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:55,886
You okay, man?

170
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,783
Thanks, Joey.

171
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,624
Hello?

172
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:08,897
Hi.

173
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,499
You all right?

174
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,668
We should go.

175
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,832
No, wait.

176
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,069
Oh, yeah. Right.

177
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,777
No. Monica.

178
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,880
Monica, we have to fix this.

179
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,210
What can we do?
You erased the message.

180
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:32,351
Yeah, but maybe I could call his machine
and re-create the message.

181
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,992
All right, okay....

182
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,285
Hello, Ross, this is Rachel Emily.

183
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,799
God, what is it with those two names?

184
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:47,966
I do so wanted to say
that I'm going to be getting married...

185
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,371
...to another British person.

186
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:57,608
And I'm having doubts and scones....

187
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,745
-I can't remember what she said.
-Yeah, that's the problem with this plan.

188
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:06,250
Rachel, come on. The message
is erased, there's nothing we can do.

189
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,915
He's never gonna find out.

190
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,584
I could tell him about it.

191
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,562
If you want to be rational,
I can't argue with you.

192
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:14,890
All right?

193
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,934
Fine, tell him. I just don't
want to be a part of it.

194
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:24,039
Maybe that's Emily leaving
the exact same message.

195
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:29,780
Hey, Ross, it's you. I just
want you to remember this feeling.

196
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,976
You are lucky to be alive.

197
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,449
So live every day to the fullest.

198
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,054
Love yourself, okay?

199
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,150
And also get stamps. Bye.

200
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:47,388
Play that message for Emily,
and this problem goes away.

201
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,725
Right?

202
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,099
Anybody want to meet a hero?

203
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,465
John Glenn is here?

204
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,232
No. Joey.

205
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,643
Joey's never been in outer space.

206
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,376
We had the most incredible night.

207
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,879
-We're in the car
-Wait. Hold on.

208
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:08,642
-Hi.
-Hi.

209
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,683
Okay, go ahead.

210
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:15,290
So we're in the car, and bang!
A shot was fired.

211
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:19,027
And Joey, with no regard
for his own safety...

212
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,323
...throws himself on me.

213
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:22,625
My God!

214
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,370
It was a car backfire.

215
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,071
But he didn't know that.

216
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah, I didn't know that.

217
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,911
It could just as easily
have been a bullet.

218
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,172
Ever think about joining the force?
We could use a guy like you.

219
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,475
Who jumps at loud noises.

220
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,547
Wow. I could have died tonight.

221
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,657
Yeah, if the car that backfired
had run over you!

222
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:53,160
I'm gonna go home, before Ross starts
rambling about his newfound respect for life.

223
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,096
I do have a newfound respect for life.

224
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,771
Oh, my God!

225
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,839
Ross, I could have told you
you weren't gonna die today.

226
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,571
What? You know when I'm gonna die?

227
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,216
-You want to get some dinner?
-Sure.

228
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,589
You know what? If I heard a shot
right now, I'd throw my body on you.

229
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,454
Maybe we should walk
in a bad neighborhood.

230
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:24,957
Okay.

231
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,354
Bye.

232
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,565
Cut it out.

233
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:38,539
I'd hate to save your life
and kick your ass on the same day.

234
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,244
Why'd you take off?

235
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,716
Just going for a walk.

236
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,416
Around the living room, whatever.

237
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,998
-ls something wrong?
-No. No, I'm just tired.

238
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,496
You know, from the walk.

239
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,097
You dove in front of Ross!

240
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,896
Ross!

241
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,077
That's what this is about.

242
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,944
Oh, my God. You hate Ross!

243
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,276
I don't hate Ross.

244
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:23,285
Of course you do. I saved him.
You're mad at me. It adds up.

245
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,082
You want Ross out of the picture.

246
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:27,781
What picture?

247
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,655
I don't know.
But I don't like what I'm hearing.

248
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,827
I'm glad you saved Ross in the car backfire.
But it could've been a bullet.

249
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,295
And you didn't try to save me.

250
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,536
You're upset because you think
I chose Ross over you.

251
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,973
No, I knew you could
take care of yourself.

252
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:51,382
You know? I mean, Ross needs help.
He's not "street" like us.

253
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:55,218
You'd risk your life for Ross
before you would for me.

254
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,115
That's the bottom line.

255
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,048
No, not exactly.

256
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,887
All right, look.

257
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,128
I wasn't trying to save Ross.

258
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,020
Okay?

259
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,962
My sandwich was next to Ross.

260
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:13,894
All right?

261
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,472
I was trying to save my sandwich.

262
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,041
From a bullet?

263
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,415
-I know it doesn't make much sense.
-"Much" sense?

264
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,813
Look, it was instinct!
I just went for it.

265
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,422
You risked your life for a sandwich?

266
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,683
I know it sounds crazy...

267
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,725
...but this is the greatest
sandwich in the world!

268
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,333
So you didn't choose Ross before me?

269
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,004
No. I would never do that.

270
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,104
You're like my brother.

271
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,068
-Really?
-Yeah.

272
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:56,371
In fact, to prove how much
you mean to me....

273
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,020
Here.

274
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,252
-Thanks.
-Easy, it's not a hot dog!

275
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,192
How good is that?

276
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,061
See?

277
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,768
What are you doing?

278
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,703
You're showing me how much
I mean to you.

279
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,274
With a bite.

280
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,542
Jeez!

281
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,589
What are you doing here?

282
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,789
Hey, you know what?

283
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,663
You are in our apartment
all the time!

284
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,397
This is just a drop
in the bucket, mister!

285
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:00,439
It doesn't matter. The important
thing is that you're here.

286
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,648
You're my friend and you're here.

287
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,254
Okay, just a little scared.
What's going on?

288
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:15,016
The most amazing thing
happened tonight.

289
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,955
I thought my number was up.

290
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,656
I had an actual near-death experience.

291
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,127
What happened?

292
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:26,803
We were on the ride-along with Gary
and somebody took a shot at me!

293
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,198
Really?

294
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,535
No. A car backfired.

295
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:39,712
But I thought somebody was taking
a shot at me. And, Rach...

296
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,709
...I survived!

297
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:47,549
And I was filled with
this great respect for life.

298
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,056
I want to experience every moment.

299
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,559
I want to seize every opportunity.

300
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:57,461
I am seeing everything so clearly now.

301
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,863
Because a car backfired?

302
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,530
Okay. Why are you here?

303
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:08,475
I don't know how this fits
into your whole "seizing" thing...

304
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,238
...but Emily called you today.

305
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,813
-You talked to her?
-She left a message.

306
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,919
But it kind of got erased.

307
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,715
I mean, there's something
wrong with your machine.

308
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,324
What did she say?

309
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:25,929
Something about having second
thoughts about the wedding...

310
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,191
...and did you guys make
a mistake breaking up?

311
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,726
And she wants you to call her.

312
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:33,727
Wow.

313
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,107
That was a good thing
that I told you, right?

314
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,774
Yeah. Yes. Of course.

315
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:43,037
Okay, thank you. Thank you.
Because

316
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,750
I'm gonna go tell Monica I was right.

317
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,612
Because she didn't want

318
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:52,186
Not important. Point is,
I was right. Your decision.

319
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,446
Okay?

320
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,022
I was right.

321
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,023
Your decision.

322
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,285
Right.

323
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,195
I guess I should call Emily.

324
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,697
No, that's not the right decision.

325
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,403
That's not right.

326
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,898
Ross, come on!

327
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,298
I mean...

328
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,965
...that woman made you miserable!

329
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,470
Do you really want
to get back into that?

330
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,911
Okay, look. Yesterday...

331
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,278
...I wouldn't have even
considered calling her back.

332
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,988
But my ex-wife calls
on the same day...

333
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,658
...I have a near-death experience?

334
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,917
That's gotta mean something.

335
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:34,724
That was not a near-death experience.
That was barely an experience.

336
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,163
You weren't there!

337
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,937
Maybe this is something that
I'm supposed to seize, you know?

338
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,467
Okay. You know what?

339
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:50,177
Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.

340
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:53,974
Maybe this is about escaping stuff.

341
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,019
Okay? Look at today.

342
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,846
I mean, you escaped...

343
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,479
...death.

344
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,958
And maybe this is a chance
for you to escape...

345
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,164
...getting back together with Emily.

346
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,091
That does make sense.

347
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,634
Because I do want to seize
some opportunity...

348
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:19,469
...but I really don't want
to see or talk to her.

349
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,111
Well, there you go!

350
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,279
Yeah, maybe today's just...

351
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,280
..."close call" day.

352
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,488
Hey, thanks, Rach.

353
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,387
Oh, honey. No problem.

354
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,055
Wait, wait.
The message is blinking.

355
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,193
Maybe you didn't erase it.

356
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,900
Hey, Ross, it's you

357
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:48,528
That's an old message.
Nobody needs to hear that.

358
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:53,174
-Hey, was Monica here?
-Yeah.

359
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,646
I want my money back.

360
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,149
You probably need that
for stamps, right?

361
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,322
Has Gary ever been shot at for real?

362
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,654
Yes, once.

363
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:12,887
A little.

364
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,396
He kind of did it to himself.

365
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,059
It's not really a good story.

366
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:22,396
I wonder how I'd react under fire.
And not backfire...

367
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,165
...but heavy fire.

368
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,400
Like, if I was in a war.

369
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,545
Man, I would be great in a war!

370
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,748
I think I'd make
a fantastic military leader.

371
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,578
I mean, I know I'd make general
before any of you guys.

372
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:39,352
Before or after you were shot
by your own troops?

373
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:43,691
I know Joey would be in the foxhole
protecting all of us.

374
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:46,625
If the foxhole was
lined with sandwiches.

375
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,128
Yeah, hero sandwiches.

376
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:57,098
You all know I'm a pacifist, so I'm
not interested in war in any way.

377
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,641
But when the revolution comes,
I'll have to destroy you all.

378
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,006
Not you, Joey.
