1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,767
- Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
- Incredible!

2
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:07,600
I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.

3
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:09,970
- Who?
- All right. I'll give you one hint.

4
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:11,977
Warren Beatty.

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:17,507
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem.

6
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:20,282
See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.

7
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,350
'Cause he was just so darn cute.

8
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:27,990
No, as part of the audition.
See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.

9
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:32,029
Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it.

10
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:37,536
Or you just do it.

11
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:40,834
I did do it, I'm a professional.

12
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:45,834
Besides my first girlfriend was Lisa Dibertis,
so I am no stranger to the mustache.

13
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:48,905
Then what's the problem?

14
00:00:49,143 --> 00:00:51,976
See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says

15
00:00:52,312 --> 00:00:54,143
'good actor, bad kisser'.

16
00:00:54,882 --> 00:00:57,976
Can you believe that, me not a good kisser,

17
00:00:58,352 --> 00:01:02,254
that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.

18
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:07,991
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.

19
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:14,991
The one with Barry And Mindy's Wedding

20
00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:01,844
Hey, what did your agent say?

21
00:02:02,284 --> 00:02:06,983
Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday.

22
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,951
Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong.

23
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:13,224
Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.

24
00:02:13,495 --> 00:02:15,122
- What, forget it!
- Yeah, right.

25
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:17,899
Come on, I need your help here.

26
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,728
All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.

27
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:23,995
You see this, this is a friend.

28
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,338
Uh-huh, let's go.

29
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:27,765
Oh, wait I have gum.

30
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay.

31
00:02:39,154 --> 00:02:40,985
Good, very good, firm but tender.

32
00:02:41,824 --> 00:02:43,018
I'd recommend you to a friend.

33
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:47,292
Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?

34
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:49,895
Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men,

35
00:02:50,132 --> 00:02:51,895
maybe you just tensed up a little,

36
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:53,595
maybe that's what you need to work on.

37
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,835
Yeah, that makes sense.

38
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:03,077
Over my dead body!

39
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:09,040
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.

40
00:03:14,523 --> 00:03:17,287
Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good!

41
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,218
Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.

42
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:27,330
Oh my God,

43
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:31,763
you look so good!

44
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:37,568
I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people

45
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,781
looking like something you drink when your nauseous.

46
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:47,114
So don't,
I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.

47
00:03:47,356 --> 00:03:49,449
Because I promised Mindy I would.

48
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,957
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.

49
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,226
Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor.

50
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,692
And besides you know what I just need

51
00:03:59,902 --> 00:04:03,201
to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.

52
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:15,981
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?

53
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:19,279
- I may have.
- Woo-hoo, stuud!

54
00:04:20,122 --> 00:04:22,181
- What's she look like?
- Well, we haven't exactly met,

55
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:24,586
we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.

56
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:27,551
Woo-hoo, geeek!

57
00:04:28,697 --> 00:04:31,427
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl,

58
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:35,394
you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...

59
00:04:35,604 --> 00:04:37,538
- Get out!
- Nooo!

60
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:41,900
Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real',

61
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:43,703
and I did.

62
00:04:46,315 --> 00:04:47,179
Wow! What's that like?

63
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:50,213
It's like this,

64
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:52,819
me, no jokes.

65
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,187
All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.

66
00:04:57,726 --> 00:04:59,921
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way.

67
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:04,262
- All right, I'll see you guys later.
- Bye, Richard.

68
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,459
Bye sweetie,

69
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:07,964
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

70
00:05:15,878 --> 00:05:17,607
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy,

71
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:21,215
I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.

72
00:05:23,485 --> 00:05:25,749
What are you talking about? What wedding?

73
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:27,548
Come on, like you never talk about that.

74
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,021
Nooo! Never!

75
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:32,124
I mean, we're living in the moment.

76
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:36,529
God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'

77
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:39,091
- Afraid to ask him?
- Could not be more terrified.

78
00:05:40,402 --> 00:05:42,893
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing,

79
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:46,102
give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.

80
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:55,102
I was laughing at this quip leno made last night.

81
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:59,102
I was not laughing at your dress,
I love you.

82
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,674
Where's Benny?

83
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:07,312
There he is!

84
00:06:07,516 --> 00:06:09,347
Where's Benny,

85
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:11,116
there he is.

86
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:16,050
Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk,

87
00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:17,987
so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.

88
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:25,033
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.

89
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:25,928
Okay.

90
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:31,369
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?

91
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:32,833
Sure I do.

92
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,102
Yeah, am I in it?

93
00:06:36,545 --> 00:06:38,536
Honey, you are it.

94
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:43,379
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.

95
00:06:48,457 --> 00:06:49,219
Keep talkin'.

96
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:53,426
Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice,

97
00:06:55,397 --> 00:06:57,422
we could move to France,

98
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:00,059
make French toast.

99
00:07:01,637 --> 00:07:05,573
Okay, so, uh, we're in France,

100
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,603
we're making the toast.

101
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:12,206
Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?

102
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:14,111
Like a hound?

103
00:07:16,952 --> 00:07:19,921
Not a basset, a bassinet.

104
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:24,755
You really need the bassinet?

105
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:28,726
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog.

106
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:33,897
Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.

107
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:37,300
Oh, hey, I love children,

108
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:39,298
I have children.

109
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,707
I just don't want to be 70

110
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:45,142
when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.

111
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:53,186
Look I want you, now.

112
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:55,886
That's Great.

113
00:07:57,293 --> 00:07:58,783
You know we don't need to talk about this now.

114
00:07:59,161 --> 00:08:02,790
Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future,

115
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:06,696
I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.

116
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,908
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much.

117
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:16,539
Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.

118
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,707
Joey, no means no!

119
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:27,648
I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.

120
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:34,188
Aww, Rach, I think you look cute

121
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:37,555
And you, uh, you,

122
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:41,528
- you I could eat with a spoon
- Get away from me I said no!

123
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,367
- Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
- Oh, Richard's here.

124
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:49,440
I should run down say bye to him

125
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:55,047
Bye.

126
00:08:57,953 --> 00:08:59,921
So how's your date with your cyberchick going.

127
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:01,517
Ooh, hey, what is all that?

128
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:04,215
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum.

129
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:06,656
See, she likes art,

130
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,161
and I like funny words.

131
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,766
What does she mean by HH?

132
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,297
It means we're holding hands.

133
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:19,640
Are you the cutest?

134
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:21,434
I'm afraid I might just be.

135
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:28,310
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person

136
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,942
and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads,

137
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:34,753
or. It could be a guy.

138
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,423
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.

139
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:41,491
It could be like a big giant guy.

140
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,831
Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back.

141
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,234
What's going on?

142
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:53,971
We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.

143
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,478
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live.

144
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,137
Women live longer than men.

145
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:04,551
How do you not fall down more?

146
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:09,456
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'

147
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:10,817
All right.

148
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:17,555
"My husband is sleeping with his secretary."

149
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:19,898
She's married!

150
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,799
Well at least we know she's a woman.

151
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:27,399
I can't believe she's married.

152
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:29,442
Aw, man I'm sorry.

153
00:10:32,047 --> 00:10:33,480
This must be very tough for ya, huh.

154
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:43,256
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings,

155
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:45,717
because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.

156
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:48,486
Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars.

157
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,460
- See, we're having fun.
- Oh, absolutely.

158
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,903
Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not going to be thinking about.

159
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,765
Neither am I.

160
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:02,175
Hi, there. Are you all right?

161
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:06,975
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding,

162
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:10,550
and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't,

163
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:15,082
people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.

164
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,815
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding,

165
00:11:17,993 --> 00:11:19,961
generally people focus on the bride.

166
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:21,793
God I know, you're right.

167
00:11:21,997 --> 00:11:24,557
All rightie, everybody look at me. Good.

168
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:28,828
All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.

169
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,666
Okay, I'll see you after the thing.

170
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,365
- Okay, good luck
- Thank you

171
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,871
Okay, Okay.

172
00:11:49,888 --> 00:11:51,412
Why the hell didn't you tell me!

173
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:52,920
I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do

174
00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:55,524
stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'

175
00:11:55,524 --> 00:11:58,861
Yeah, better than you embarrass and I will go.

176
00:11:58,861 --> 00:12:00,852
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating.

177
00:12:01,063 --> 00:12:04,521
I think the only thing that tops that was, was,

178
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:08,032
was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school.

179
00:12:08,204 --> 00:12:10,764
I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out.

180
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:12,702
Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.

181
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:15,842
Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.

182
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:19,242
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.

183
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,345
Rachel!

184
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:24,309
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.

185
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,818
It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear,

186
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:29,752
in fact I hardly expected to see so much.

187
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,091
You told me you didn't see anything.

188
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:35,593
I tell ya a lot things!

189
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,528
Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.

190
00:12:41,003 --> 00:12:41,867
Stay well.

191
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:47,573
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.

192
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:49,776
Rach! Rach!

193
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:53,046
- Oh my God, I'm married!
- I know.

194
00:12:53,282 --> 00:12:55,614
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.

195
00:12:56,385 --> 00:12:58,819
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.

196
00:12:59,088 --> 00:12:59,554
Min.

197
00:13:01,023 --> 00:13:02,547
Oh Rach, you're still here,

198
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:05,189
at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.

199
00:13:06,562 --> 00:13:08,257
Yeah, I love that story.

200
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:11,466
Um, I got a question for you guys.

201
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:14,066
Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?

202
00:13:15,471 --> 00:13:18,133
Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding,

203
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,401
Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.

204
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:24,640
Insane!

205
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:26,747
...from the syphilis.

206
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:27,671
What?!

207
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:32,251
Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.

208
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:37,251
Your choice was that, syphilis?

209
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:42,251
Hey, sweetie, at least they put you Tutsi show under prospective.

210
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,585
Angela? Joey Tribiani.

211
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,988
Listen, what are ya doing tonight?

212
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:54,233
I know your seeing that guy, I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....

213
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,893
Hello? Hello?

214
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,539
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent.

215
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,918
- She wants to know what's wrong?
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

216
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,555
You're married that's what's wrong.

217
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,292
- Oh, my.
- What?

218
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,225
She wants to meet you in person.

219
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,292
Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too,

220
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,831
okay, but she's married, she has a husband.

221
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:32,629
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy.

222
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,167
I mean you don't get chances like this all the time,

223
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,707
if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself

224
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,438
when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.

225
00:14:43,438 --> 00:14:45,438
I don't know.

226
00:14:45,438 --> 00:14:50,438
Listen, those bingbongs are the woman who loves you.

227
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:53,814
Okay, I'll do it!

228
00:14:53,984 --> 00:14:55,611
Oh, yeah! Okay! Great!

229
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:59,722
Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her!

230
00:14:59,957 --> 00:15:03,324
Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww.

231
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,257
No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first.

232
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:08,988
No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.

233
00:15:14,238 --> 00:15:17,537
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.

234
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:19,300
Okay, last chance.

235
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,010
Again, I'm sorry.

236
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:35,056
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children.

237
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:38,761
You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society,

238
00:15:39,296 --> 00:15:40,456
and by that I mean my mom,

239
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:43,789
has always convinced me that I...

240
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:49,933
I do,

241
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,903
I have to have children, I'm sorry. I just do.

242
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,313
Yo! Can I have your attention, please,

243
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:00,578
Best Man, making a toast here.

244
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:01,944
Thank you.

245
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:06,779
I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...

246
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:10,792
What?!

247
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:13,761
What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech.

248
00:16:15,032 --> 00:16:16,863
Thank you, thank you very much.

249
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:21,362
Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together.

250
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:23,563
And Rachel...

251
00:16:24,408 --> 00:16:26,876
- What.
- No, no, no now in all seriousness,

252
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:30,106
its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight,

253
00:16:30,581 --> 00:16:33,277
and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!

254
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:43,653
Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...

255
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:45,089
- Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?

256
00:16:47,264 --> 00:16:51,200
Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.

257
00:16:51,368 --> 00:16:52,198
Oh dear God.

258
00:16:53,704 --> 00:16:54,466
Ross,

259
00:16:55,005 --> 00:17:01,069
uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight.

260
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,242
And, uh, for the record

261
00:17:04,882 --> 00:17:08,249
she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.

262
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:12,654
What are you doing I'm serious.

263
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:20,791
Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him,

264
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,300
which incidentally worked out pretty well for me

265
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:47,300
Rachel, took a lot of courage, doesn't has the syphilis and wild with me.

266
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:49,799
Cheers!

267
00:17:51,711 --> 00:17:53,508
- See you in the parking lot.
- No, Rach!

268
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,711
And once again she is out of here.

269
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:01,820
Okay who had 9:45? Um?

270
00:18:15,735 --> 00:18:18,397
Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave.

271
00:18:18,872 --> 00:18:21,500
I probably should, but I'm not,

272
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:26,306
see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings.

273
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,717
See now, tonight, all I really wanted was

274
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:38,222
to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity.

275
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:42,718
Well, I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen.

276
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:51,633
There's nothing really left to say except....

277
00:18:57,944 --> 00:19:03,712
"Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl.

278
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:13,016
With yellow feathers, feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there.

279
00:19:13,593 --> 00:19:15,117
She would..."

280
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:17,388
- Marenge,
- "...marenge, thank you honey,

281
00:19:17,998 --> 00:19:20,330
and do the cha-cha.

282
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,533
And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar.

283
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:27,798
At the, wait, wait, everybody.."

284
00:19:50,931 --> 00:19:53,422
Okay, I'll do it.

285
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:55,596
You'll do what?

286
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:58,667
If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.

287
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:00,904
Oh my God!

288
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,869
If I have to I'll, I'll do all again,

289
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,178
I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing,

290
00:20:06,646 --> 00:20:08,273
I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings,

291
00:20:08,782 --> 00:20:10,215
I'll coach the soccer team.

292
00:20:11,618 --> 00:20:13,381
- Really?
- Yeah, if I have to.

293
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:15,982
Monica,

294
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:20,419
I don't wanna lose you,

295
00:20:21,728 --> 00:20:25,824
so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.

296
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:31,934
You're the most wonderful man.

297
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:40,311
And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times,

298
00:20:41,348 --> 00:20:43,009
then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'

299
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:46,915
But you're not.

300
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:50,986
Oh my God,

301
00:20:53,226 --> 00:20:54,989
I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say.

302
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:00,523
I wanna have a baby,

303
00:21:04,204 --> 00:21:07,799
but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.

304
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:11,907
God.

305
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:18,983
I love you.

306
00:21:24,424 --> 00:21:25,482
I know you do.

307
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:29,723
Me too.

308
00:21:37,537 --> 00:21:38,469
So what now?

309
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:42,267
I guess we just

310
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:45,068
keep dancing.

311
00:22:00,427 --> 00:22:01,917
Where is she, Where is she?

312
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,020
Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?

313
00:22:05,432 --> 00:22:08,128
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.

314
00:22:12,138 --> 00:22:12,695
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.

315
00:22:13,273 --> 00:22:15,503
Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.

316
00:22:17,077 --> 00:22:20,410
Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot,

317
00:22:20,814 --> 00:22:23,874
you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil.

318
00:22:25,151 --> 00:22:28,052
I think what you have to do is try not to...

319
00:22:33,927 --> 00:22:35,326
Oh my God!

320
00:22:38,431 --> 00:22:42,834
OH.....MY.....GAWD!!

321
00:22:52,612 --> 00:22:56,480
OH.....MY.....GOD!!

322
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:08,518
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this,

323
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:13,223
because I wanna be a good friend,  and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes.

324
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:21,400
Wow, you are a good friend,

325
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,570
'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it.

326
00:23:27,046 --> 00:23:28,513
But that was a hell of a kiss.

327
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,840
Rachel is a very lucky girl.
