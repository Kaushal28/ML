1
00:00:06,084 --> 00:00:08,348
This cake is amazing!

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,216
My God, get a room.

3
00:00:11,757 --> 00:00:13,418
I would get a room with this cake.

4
00:00:13,592 --> 00:00:15,787
I think I could show
this cake a good time.

5
00:00:17,496 --> 00:00:20,329
If you had to, what would
you give up, food or sex?

6
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:22,558
Sex.

7
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:25,700
Seriously, answer faster.

8
00:00:26,505 --> 00:00:27,904
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

9
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:31,338
But when she said "sex,"
I wasn't thinking about sex with you.

10
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:36,305
It's like a giant hug.

11
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,913
Ross, how about you?
Which would you give up?

12
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:41,816
Food.

13
00:00:41,987 --> 00:00:43,454
How about sex or dinosaurs?

14
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:52,092
Oh, my God, it's like <i>Sophie's Choice</i>.

15
00:00:52,464 --> 00:00:53,795
Oh, God.

16
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:56,696
What about you, Joe?
What would you give up, sex or food?

17
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,597
I don't know, it's too hard.

18
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:05,132
No, you gotta pick one.

19
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:08,174
Food. No, sex.

20
00:01:08,347 --> 00:01:12,010
Food. Sex. Food. Sex--
I don't know! Oh, God, I want both!

21
00:01:12,217 --> 00:01:15,118
I want-- I want girls on bread!

22
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:09,434
- You gotta see these pictures of Emma.
- Oh, how cute!

23
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:13,044
- She looks just like a little doll.
- Oh, no, that is a doll.

24
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:16,044
Oh, thank God,
because that thing's really creepy.

25
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:21,048
Look, there's Chandler.

26
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,647
Who's the blond? She's pretty.

27
00:02:23,822 --> 00:02:25,187
He's having an affair.

28
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:27,816
He is not having an affair!

29
00:02:27,993 --> 00:02:29,961
I'm always right about these things.

30
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:33,791
No, you're not. Last week,
you thought Ross was trying to kill you.

31
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:37,867
Well, sorry, but it's hard to believe
that anyone would tell a story that dull...

32
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:39,970
...just to tell it.

33
00:02:41,506 --> 00:02:43,440
There's something going on with them.

34
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:45,701
Look! He's getting into the car with her.

35
00:02:45,877 --> 00:02:47,401
That doesn't mean anything.

36
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,513
Oh, yeah? Well, let's see.

37
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,615
Okay, duck down.

38
00:02:57,923 --> 00:03:00,483
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Chandler. It's Phoebe.</i>

39
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:02,718
<i>I know that Monica is working today...</i>

40
00:03:02,894 --> 00:03:06,455
...so I was wondering if you wanted to
come to the movies with me and Rachel.

41
00:03:07,032 --> 00:03:11,731
Oh, I have to work too. Yeah,
I'm stuck here at the office all day.

42
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,404
Well, it's a shame
that you'll miss the movie...

43
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:22,012
...because we were gonna see,
you know, either <i>Liar Liar</i>...

44
00:03:23,248 --> 00:03:28,413
...or <i>Betrayal</i> or <i>An Affair to Remember</i>.

45
00:03:29,154 --> 00:03:31,019
Those are all really old.

46
00:03:31,757 --> 00:03:34,282
Okay, then maybe it'll be--

47
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:36,188
<i>Dude, Where's My Car?</i>

48
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:39,825
- What?
- They're in a car.

49
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:44,132
Okay. Well, talk to you later, okay? Bye.

50
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:45,834
Jeez!

51
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:48,802
Okay, quick. We gotta find a cab
and follow them.

52
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:53,206
Yeah, okay. Let me just grab my
night-vision goggles and my stun gun.

53
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:55,636
I got them.

54
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:02,578
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi, sweetie.

55
00:04:02,754 --> 00:04:05,086
Hey, you smell like
perfume and cigarettes.

56
00:04:05,257 --> 00:04:07,885
- I was in the car with Nancy.
- Nancy doesn't smoke.

57
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:11,222
Well, at least the perfume's not mine.
Be thankful for that.

58
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:15,532
So.... What did you think of the house?

59
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,668
It's everything we've been looking for.

60
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:20,532
Isn't it? And what about
the amazing wanes coating...

61
00:04:20,705 --> 00:04:23,435
...the crown molding
and the dormer windows in the attic?

62
00:04:23,608 --> 00:04:25,974
And the wiggle woms and the zip zorps!

63
00:04:27,646 --> 00:04:29,409
What were the things you said?

64
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:32,549
- Don't you love the huge yard?
- The fireplace in the bedroom.

65
00:04:32,717 --> 00:04:34,708
And Nancy said it's really underpriced...

66
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:38,845
...because the guy lost his job
and has to move in with his parents!

67
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:41,857
This is bringing out a lovely color in you.

68
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:45,296
So do you think we should get it?

69
00:04:45,463 --> 00:04:47,021
I don't know. What do you think?

70
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,632
- I think we should.
- I do too.

71
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,428
This is huge. How bad
do you wanna smoke right now?

72
00:04:51,603 --> 00:04:54,629
I don't know what you mean,
giant, talking cigarette.

73
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:58,239
Phoebe called as I was getting
into Nancy's car.

74
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,378
If she asks you, I was at work all day.

75
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:02,376
Got you. When do we tell them?

76
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:06,142
We don't. Not until it's 100 percent.
Why upset everybody over nothing?

77
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:07,649
Okay. Right.

78
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:12,847
- Oh, my God, that is gonna be so hard.
- I know. Good luck with it.

79
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:17,727
I just can't see Chandler cheating.

80
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:21,423
I'm telling you guys, we followed
them out to a house in Westchester.

81
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,264
They went in for 45 minutes, and then
they came out looking pretty happy.

82
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:29,598
Chandler?

83
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:31,264
Forty-five minutes?

84
00:05:33,578 --> 00:05:35,068
Well, something's not right.

85
00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:39,608
So you went all the way
to Westchester, waited 45 minutes...

86
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:41,877
- ...and came back in a cab?
- Yeah.

87
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:45,580
If each of you guys would like
to pitch in 100 bucks, that would be great.

88
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:48,822
I can't believe he'd do this to Monica.

89
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:51,224
I know, and with the baby coming?

90
00:05:51,396 --> 00:05:53,626
- So should we tell her?
- I don't know.

91
00:05:53,798 --> 00:05:57,700
If one of us saw Mike with another
woman, would you want us to tell you?

92
00:05:57,869 --> 00:06:00,167
Why? Who'd you see him with?

93
00:06:00,338 --> 00:06:03,796
- No one. I'm just saying if we did--
- Tell me what you know!

94
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:08,207
No one! Nothing! Mike's a great guy!
It was hypothetical!

95
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,605
All right. He is a good guy.

96
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:13,944
You're right. He wouldn't cheat.

97
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:16,811
If I did see him with someone,
there's no way l--

98
00:06:16,988 --> 00:06:18,888
Who did you see him with?

99
00:06:32,904 --> 00:06:35,771
Oh, look at her. So happy.

100
00:06:39,277 --> 00:06:42,644
If only there were a smaller one
to clean this one.

101
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,318
Hey, is Chandler here?

102
00:06:47,485 --> 00:06:49,715
No, he's picking up dinner.
Why? What's up?

103
00:06:53,758 --> 00:06:57,558
Look, whatever happens,
we're here for you, and we love you.

104
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:03,165
- All right.
- Chandler might be having an affair.

105
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:06,026
- What?
- Phoebe and I saw Chandler...

106
00:07:06,204 --> 00:07:09,469
...with a blond woman today
outside on the street.

107
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:13,099
And then we followed them
to a house in Westchester.

108
00:07:13,278 --> 00:07:16,805
They went in together. I'm so sorry.

109
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:23,853
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that's awful.

110
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:27,387
What did you think of the house?

111
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:32,061
What?

112
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,630
Monica, you understand
what we're saying, right?

113
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:39,702
Yeah. Sure. I mean,
I'm devastated, obviously.

114
00:07:40,705 --> 00:07:43,469
Did you think the neighborhood
was homey?

115
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:48,307
- Hey.
- You son of a bitch.

116
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:53,012
Is it me, or have the greetings
gone downhill around here?

117
00:07:53,818 --> 00:07:57,686
Phoebe and Rachel
saw you with Nancy today.

118
00:07:57,856 --> 00:07:59,619
They think you're having an affair.

119
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,588
- Who's Nancy?
- What's going on?

120
00:08:03,028 --> 00:08:04,859
Okay....

121
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,520
All right, you better sit down.

122
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:09,428
- This is-- This is pretty big.
- Yeah.

123
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:14,295
I'm not having an affair.

124
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:18,636
Nancy is our realtor.

125
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,576
I knew he couldn't be
with a woman for 45 minutes!

126
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:27,751
Why do you have a realtor?

127
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,220
She's been showing
us houses outside of the city.

128
00:08:32,257 --> 00:08:35,124
- What?
- Are you serious?

129
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:37,921
When we found out
that we were gonna get this baby...

130
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:41,395
...Chandler and I decided
we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.

131
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:43,466
So you're-- So you're gonna move?

132
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:45,597
Oh, my God.

133
00:08:46,237 --> 00:08:49,035
Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?

134
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:52,638
What is wrong with raising
a kid in the city?

135
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:55,279
I'm doing it. Ross is doing it.

136
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:57,915
Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!

137
00:08:58,783 --> 00:09:02,412
And that's great for you guys,
but we want a lawn and a swing set.

138
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:04,782
A street where our kids
can ride their bikes...

139
00:09:04,956 --> 00:09:07,015
...and maybe an ice-cream truck
can go by.

140
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:09,888
So you want to buy a house in the '50s.

141
00:09:11,496 --> 00:09:13,623
Have you thought about
what you're giving up?

142
00:09:13,798 --> 00:09:15,959
You can't move out of the city.
What if--?

143
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:18,227
What if you want
Chinese food at 5 a.m.?

144
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:21,236
Or a fake Rolex that breaks
as soon as it rains?

145
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:24,739
Or an Asian hooker
sent right to your door?

146
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:29,372
You know what? If you want
to look for a house, that's okay.

147
00:09:29,547 --> 00:09:32,573
No! No, it's not! Don't listen to him.
I'm gonna thump you.

148
00:09:34,252 --> 00:09:37,744
It's okay, because they have
to get it out of their system.

149
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:42,985
Okay? But you're gonna realize
this is the only place you want to be.

150
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:46,959
Actually...

151
00:09:47,132 --> 00:09:48,793
...we already found a house we love.

152
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:53,461
- What?
- About an hour ago, we made an offer.

153
00:10:00,011 --> 00:10:02,445
Bet you wish I was
having an affair now, huh?

154
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:09,578
- You put an offer on a house?
- It's so sweet.

155
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:13,121
It really is. It has this big yard
that leads down to this stream.

156
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,156
And then there's these old maple trees.

157
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:17,988
Oh, again with the nature.
What are you, beavers?

158
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:21,326
Look, I know this is really hard,
and we're really sorry.

159
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:24,730
Is this because I come over here
without knocking and eat your food?

160
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:27,098
Because I can stop doing that.

161
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:29,671
I really, really think I can.

162
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:32,241
You know that's not the reason, Joe.

163
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:40,514
I think if you saw it, you'd understand.

164
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:42,983
You guys were there.
It's beautiful, isn't it?

165
00:10:46,157 --> 00:10:48,250
- Yeah, it is.
- What the hell are you doing?

166
00:10:48,426 --> 00:10:52,260
Well, it is, all right? When we were
out there today, all I kept thinking was:

167
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,796
"l can't believe Chandler's
screwing this woman...

168
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:57,332
...but, man, this would be
a nice place to live!"

169
00:10:57,969 --> 00:10:59,630
Yeah, but so is this.

170
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:02,830
Yeah. I mean, if you move there,
you have to leave here.

171
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:05,532
I mean, how can you leave this place?

172
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:11,046
Come on, Daddy, listen!

173
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:14,947
All my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!"

174
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:17,644
"You're a shoe! You're a shoe.
You're a shoe!"

175
00:11:17,822 --> 00:11:20,814
I stopped and said,
"What if I don't want to be a shoe?

176
00:11:20,992 --> 00:11:23,051
What if I want to be a purse?

177
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:26,425
Or a hat?"

178
00:11:26,998 --> 00:11:29,592
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
l--

179
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,962
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

180
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:35,764
You can see where he'd have trouble.

181
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:40,501
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

182
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:46,006
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

183
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,853
Your money's mine, Greene.

184
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:51,750
Your fly's open, Geller.

185
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,092
You know what I just realized?

186
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,559
"Joker" is "poker" with a "J"!

187
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:02,331
Coincidence?

188
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,833
That's "joincidence" with a "C"!

189
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:13,970
Look! Ugly Naked Guy
lit a bunch of candles.

190
00:12:20,451 --> 00:12:22,442
That had to hurt!

191
00:12:25,123 --> 00:12:27,114
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.

192
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:29,658
Instead of watching football,
you could help.

193
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:31,727
We know.

194
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,027
Rachel, you want to put
the marshmallows in concentric circles.

195
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,169
No, Mon. You want to put them
in concentric circles.

196
00:12:39,337 --> 00:12:41,828
I want to do this.

197
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:52,808
Every year.

198
00:12:55,787 --> 00:12:57,846
It's stuck!

199
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:00,354
Step.

200
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:01,890
How did it get on?

201
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,756
I put it on to scare Chandler.

202
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:08,592
Oh, my God! Monica's going to
totally freak out!

203
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:10,461
Plus, it smells really bad in here.

204
00:13:10,635 --> 00:13:15,732
Of course it smells bad.
You have your head up a turkey's ass.

205
00:13:17,775 --> 00:13:19,072
Monica.

206
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,076
Did you get the turkey--?

207
00:13:23,247 --> 00:13:26,011
Oh, my God!

208
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:27,975
Who is that?

209
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:29,710
It's Joey.

210
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:31,852
I got it!

211
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:35,117
If we win, they have to
get rid of the rooster.

212
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:37,284
That's interesting!

213
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:39,461
If you win...

214
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,359
...we give up the bird.

215
00:13:44,268 --> 00:13:46,259
But if we win...

216
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:48,701
...we get your apartment.

217
00:13:51,642 --> 00:13:53,405
- Deal!
- What?

218
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:57,109
"Monica's nickname
when she was a hockey goalie?"

219
00:13:57,281 --> 00:13:59,306
- Big Fat Goalie.
- Correct!

220
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:02,812
"Rachel claims
it's her favorite movie."

221
00:14:02,987 --> 00:14:04,420
<i>Dangerous Liaisons</i>.

222
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:07,251
- "Her actual favorite movie is...?"
- <i>Weekend at Bernie's</i>.

223
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,321
"Monica categorizes her towels.
How many categories are there?"

224
00:14:13,498 --> 00:14:14,829
- Everyday use.
- Fancy.

225
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:16,466
- Guest.
- Fancy guest.

226
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:18,568
- Two seconds.
- Eleven?

227
00:14:19,604 --> 00:14:21,936
Unbelievable!
Eleven is correct.

228
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:26,808
"Chandler was how old when he
first touched a girl's breast?"

229
00:14:26,978 --> 00:14:28,309
- 14?
- No, 19.

230
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:30,071
Thanks, man.

231
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:32,409
"Joey had an imaginary
childhood friend.

232
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,448
- His name was...?"
- Maurice!

233
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:36,883
- "His profession was...?"
- Space cowboy!

234
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,185
"What is Chandler Bing's job?"

235
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,857
Ten seconds.
You need this or you lose.

236
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:50,728
Something to do
with transponding.

237
00:14:50,902 --> 00:14:53,894
He's a transponster!

238
00:14:54,071 --> 00:14:56,130
That's not even a word!

239
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:10,678
You are mean boys
who are just being mean!

240
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:14,188
Don't get mad! No one
forced you to raise the stakes.

241
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:16,918
That is not true!
She forced me!

242
00:15:17,094 --> 00:15:19,654
You got the question wrong.

243
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:22,163
It was a stupid, unfair question!

244
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,994
Don't blame the questions!

245
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:29,606
Stop yelling in our apartment!
You are ruining moving day for us.

246
00:15:30,107 --> 00:15:31,472
Chandler!

247
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:37,377
I saw what you were doing
in the window!

248
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:40,745
I saw what you're doing to my sister!
Get out here!

249
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:44,118
Listen, we had a good run.

250
00:15:44,288 --> 00:15:46,586
What was it?
Four, five months?

251
00:15:46,757 --> 00:15:50,124
That's more than most people
have in a lifetime. Goodbye.

252
00:15:52,396 --> 00:15:54,261
Hey, Ross.
What's up, bro?

253
00:15:56,501 --> 00:16:00,460
What the hell are you doing?

254
00:16:00,638 --> 00:16:01,696
What's going on?

255
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:05,934
I think Ross knows
about me and Monica.

256
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:09,210
Dude, he's right there.

257
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:14,441
I thought you were my best friend!
This is my sister!

258
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:17,815
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot believe this!

259
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:21,789
We're not just messing around.
I love her.

260
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,790
I'm in love with her.

261
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:27,756
I'm so sorry that you
had to find out this way.

262
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,726
I'm sorry, but it's true.
I love him too.

263
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:41,073
My best friend and my sister!

264
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:46,349
I cannot believe this!

265
00:16:47,785 --> 00:16:49,582
This is the last box of your clothes.

266
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:52,689
I'm just gonna label it
"What were you thinking?"

267
00:16:54,091 --> 00:16:57,754
I was gonna go across
the hall and write that on Chandler.

268
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:03,094
Guys, I don't wanna make
things worse, but...

269
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:05,667
...l don't want to live with
Rachel anymore.

270
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,361
You're so mean to each other.

271
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:11,804
I don't wanna end up like that
with Rachel. I still like you.

272
00:17:12,343 --> 00:17:15,870
That's fine because I'm not moving.

273
00:17:16,047 --> 00:17:18,015
Phoebe, you gotta take her.

274
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,778
I said some bad stuff...

275
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:24,115
...but Rachel has qualities
that make her a good roommate.

276
00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:29,453
She gets tons of catalogs and folds
down the pages of things I'd like.

277
00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:30,889
What else?

278
00:17:32,363 --> 00:17:34,490
When I take a shower...

279
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:36,929
...she leaves me notes on the mirror.

280
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:39,331
I do. I do do that.

281
00:17:39,503 --> 00:17:43,564
That's nice. I like having things
to read in the bathroom.

282
00:17:45,643 --> 00:17:48,271
When I fall asleep on the couch...

283
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,473
...she covers me with a blanket.

284
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:55,608
Well, you know,
I don't want you to be cold.

285
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:02,020
And when I told her that I was gonna
move in with Chandler...

286
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:04,786
...she was really supportive.

287
00:18:07,331 --> 00:18:09,196
You were so great.

288
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:13,261
You made it so easy.

289
00:18:14,472 --> 00:18:17,066
And now you have to leave.

290
00:18:17,274 --> 00:18:19,970
And I have to live with a boy!

291
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:39,355
- She really left.
- I know.

292
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,000
- Thank you.
- No problem, roomie.

293
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:55,638
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

294
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:58,543
What the hell is that dog doing here?

295
00:18:59,684 --> 00:19:01,584
A little toast here. Ding, ding!

296
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:05,279
This isn't exactly the kind of
Thanksgiving you planned...

297
00:19:05,456 --> 00:19:09,187
...but for me this has
been really great.

298
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,796
I think because it didn't
involve divorce...

299
00:19:12,963 --> 00:19:14,260
...or projectile vomiting.

300
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:18,761
If you had gone to Vail...

301
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:23,236
...or if you had been with your
family, or if you didn't have...

302
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:25,034
...syphilis and stuff...

303
00:19:27,311 --> 00:19:29,279
...we wouldn't be
all together.

304
00:19:29,447 --> 00:19:31,506
So I guess what I'm trying
to say is...

305
00:19:31,682 --> 00:19:37,518
...that I'm very thankful that all
of your Thanksgivings sucked.

306
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:41,656
- That's so sweet!
- Thank you.

307
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:45,991
Here's to a lousy Christmas!

308
00:19:46,163 --> 00:19:47,425
And a crappy New Year!

309
00:19:47,598 --> 00:19:50,089
- Hear, hear!
- Hear, hear!

310
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:58,237
You can't move. You just--
You just can't.

311
00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:01,037
Rachel's right.
This is where you guys belong.

312
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:04,773
You don't wanna live in Westchester.
That's the worst of the Chesters.

313
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:09,542
You know, sometimes when I'm alone
in my apartment, I look over here...

314
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,053
...and you guys are just having dinner...

315
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:16,159
...or watching TV or something...

316
00:20:16,827 --> 00:20:18,522
...but it makes me feel better.

317
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:21,187
And now when I look over,
who am I gonna see?

318
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:23,799
The Gottliebs? The Yangs?

319
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:26,629
They don't make me feel so good.

320
00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:32,171
Yeah. So don't move, okay?
Just stay here...

321
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:34,538
- ...and maybe close your blinds at night.
- Hey.

322
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:42,646
Hello?

323
00:20:45,322 --> 00:20:47,620
It's Nancy. They responded to our offer.

324
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:49,054
And?

325
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:54,027
Okay. Thanks.

326
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,224
They passed.

327
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:01,698
They said they won't go a penny
under the asking price.

328
00:21:01,872 --> 00:21:04,773
- We can't afford that.
- I know.

329
00:21:07,011 --> 00:21:08,410
Well, there you go.

330
00:21:13,384 --> 00:21:14,874
I'm really sorry, you guys.

331
00:21:15,052 --> 00:21:18,647
Yeah, I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry
that phone call didn't come...

332
00:21:18,823 --> 00:21:21,348
...before I told you about looking
through the window.

333
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:24,887
Yeah. Well, we're gonna
let you be alone.

334
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:26,962
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, we'll be okay.

335
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:28,462
Love you guys.

336
00:21:31,035 --> 00:21:33,868
You know, I'm really sorry
I wasn't more supportive before.

337
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:35,562
That's okay. We understand.

338
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:37,570
Yeah, and about this Nancy....

339
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:39,868
If you're not sleeping with her, should l?

340
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:49,479
I know there'll be other houses,
but I just--

341
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:52,679
- I love that one so much.
- Yeah.

342
00:21:53,357 --> 00:21:55,382
Well, it's a good thing we got it then.

343
00:21:57,027 --> 00:21:59,086
- What?
- We got the house.

344
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:02,795
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't wanna tell you in front of them.

345
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,592
We got it?! We got the house?!

346
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:06,395
We're getting a house!

347
00:22:10,641 --> 00:22:13,439
- We're getting a house.
- And a baby.

348
00:22:13,611 --> 00:22:15,010
We're growing up.

349
00:22:16,313 --> 00:22:17,905
We sure are.

350
00:22:18,816 --> 00:22:20,340
- Who's gonna tell them?
- Not it!

351
00:22:20,517 --> 00:22:22,382
Not it! Damn it!

352
00:22:26,857 --> 00:22:28,518
Rachel, this is yours.

353
00:22:28,692 --> 00:22:30,284
Why? What are these for?

354
00:22:30,461 --> 00:22:33,328
- You'll see.
- All right, everybody open them.

355
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:38,530
Wow, this is so beautiful!

356
00:22:38,702 --> 00:22:41,034
These are the ones
I was looking at in the store!

357
00:22:41,205 --> 00:22:43,139
- I know.
- Oh, I love this!

358
00:22:43,307 --> 00:22:45,502
A meatball sub!

359
00:22:45,943 --> 00:22:47,274
Thanks!

360
00:22:47,444 --> 00:22:50,072
Seriously, guys, what's going on?
What are these for?

361
00:22:50,247 --> 00:22:53,512
Well, I didn't know
how to tell you before...

362
00:22:53,684 --> 00:22:55,549
- ...but we got the house.
- Enjoy!

363
00:23:00,624 --> 00:23:01,852
What did they say?
