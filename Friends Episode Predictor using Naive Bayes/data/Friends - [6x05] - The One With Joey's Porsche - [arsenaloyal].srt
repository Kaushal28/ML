1
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:07,400
I cannot believe that you didn't
tell me we are still married!

2
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,371
Look, I was going to tell you.

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:12,102
When? After the birth
of our first secret child?

4
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,648
Ross didn't get the annulment.
We are still married!

5
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,909
-You're kidding.
-Oh, my God!

6
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:26,222
It wasn't my best decision, but I
couldn't face another failed marriage.

7
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:30,193
At what point did you think
this was a successful marriage?

8
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:37,295
Rach, come on. If you think about it,
it's actually kind of funny.

9
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,806
Maybe it's best not to think about it.

10
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:47,104
This is inexcusable.
I'm shocked to my very core.

11
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,012
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.

12
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,814
Another lie. You have a sickness!

13
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,695
For my own peace of mind,
are you married to any more of us?

14
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,861
Look, Rach, I was going to tell you.

15
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,593
I just wanted to do it in my own way.

16
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,670
Yes, silently, with no words.

17
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,737
Look, in Ross' defense, okay....

18
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,556
The One With Joey's Porsche

19
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,688
Someone left their keys.

20
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,688
To a Porsche.

21
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:14,260
-Are these yours?
-Yeah. That's what I drive.

22
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,329
I make 4 bucks an hour.
I saved up for 350 years.

23
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,074
Did anybody lose their keys?

24
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,010
Put them in the lost and found.

25
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,945
There's a lost and found?

26
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,914
My shoe!

27
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,086
You left a shoe here?

28
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:42,024
I didn't realize till I got home.
I wasn't gonna walk back with one shoe.

29
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:46,492
I'll go find that guy's car
and leave a note on the windshield.

30
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,033
When he comes back for his keys,
I'll give him your shoe.

31
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,192
Great. Thanks.

32
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,369
Oh, good. You guys are here.
Listen.

33
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:00,877
How would you like to spend tomorrow
taking care of three cute puppies?

34
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,311
My God! What a fun day!
Sounds great!

35
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,144
Yeah, all right.

36
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,783
I'll bring them by tomorrow morning.

37
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,220
By the way, they're not
actually puppies.

38
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,087
They're Frank and Alice's triplets.
See you.

39
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,555
What?

40
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,821
Please, please, please?
Frank and Alice...

41
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:23,526
asked me to baby-sit them.
I'm nervous. I've never done that.

42
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,364
Don't worry. We'll do it.

43
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:29,497
I'm gonna pass, because I was
kind of iffy when it was puppies.

44
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:34,406
Come on, Chandler. It'll give us
great practice for when...

45
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,845
people with babies come to visit.

46
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:49,622
So I still have boxes here.

47
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,530
I still have boxes at Ross'.

48
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,667
And I have nowhere to live.

49
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,394
I could so easily freak out right now.

50
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:03,206
What about me? Denise is leaving town
for a while. I don't have a roommate.

51
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:10,114
Well, maybe I could be
your roommate, Phoebe.

52
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,615
Maybe you could be my roommate!

53
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,781
Well, there's an idea!

54
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,287
That would be great!

55
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:22,724
-How long is Denise gone for?
-She said she'd be back December 26th.

56
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,624
December 26th.

57
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,094
Maybe she's Santa Claus.

58
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:37,165
Oh, look who it is.
My husband, the apple of my eye.

59
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,870
Okay, I got us a court date
for tomorrow at 2...

60
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,413
and I picked up all the forms.

61
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,982
I'll take care of it.

62
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:49,815
Sure, if you say you'll take care
of it, I have no reason to doubt you.

63
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,819
Give me those forms.

64
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:55,825
I'm gonna do this my way and I
don't wanna hear a peep out of you.

65
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,486
-Okay, Rach, but..
-You're peeping!

66
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,794
Ross, I just got..

67
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,436
-Why did you do this?
-I told you..

68
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,337
I don't wanna hear
"three failed marriages."

69
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,308
If you'd had two failed marriages,
you'd understand.

70
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,709
Thanks to you, I'm halfway there.

71
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:23,622
Oh, I am so mad, Ross! I don't think
I've ever been this angry!

72
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,355
What about when I said
we were on a break?

73
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,983
-Nice car.
-Yeah, it's not mine.

74
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:00,222
-I love your car.
-Yeah, it's mine.

75
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:05,153
-I bet it's fast.
-Me too. Yeah.

76
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,424
And comfortable.

77
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,500
-You like leather seats?
-Yeah.

78
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,239
It's got them!

79
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,044
Phoebe, how's it going?

80
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,341
I'm okay. Are they having fun?
Am I talking too fast?

81
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,881
No. You sound like me.

82
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:29,351
It's going great. Look at Chandler
with Little Baby Girl Chandler.

83
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:34,484
Little Baby Girl Chandler. Where have
I heard that before? Oh, Coach Rubin.

84
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:44,894
Phoebe, when you're done over there,
we've got a situation over here too.

85
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,864
No. We are all responsible
for our own babies.

86
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,442
That's where you're wrong.
We've been playing them man-to-man.

87
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,240
We should really be playing
a zone defense.

88
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,542
What do you mean?

89
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:02,017
Things'll go smoother if we each have a
zone. Phoebe, be in charge of wiping.

90
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,119
Mon, be in charge of diapering.

91
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:09,751
I'll be in charge of looking at how cute
they are when they put their hands...

92
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,295
Sounds great, but you should be
in charge of wiping.

93
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,402
Okay, I'm a rookie.
I should not be in the end zone.

94
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:32,450
This is so great. This is exactly how
we set the plates at the restaurant.

95
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,450
Yeah? Well, this is not
what I ordered.

96
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,050
Hey, guys.

97
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,216
Hey, babies.

98
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,429
I'm having the best morning.

99
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,158
That Porsche I've got the keys to?
Still there.

100
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,861
Shocking, since you
still have the keys.

101
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,998
You should see the treatment I get
with that car.

102
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:59,702
People are friendly. They wanna talk.
And not just about the car.

103
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,040
One guy advised me
on my equity investments.

104
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,341
What equity investments?

105
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,644
The ones that got me the Porsche.
Will you keep up?

106
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:15,187
If people see me just standing there,
they're gonna think I don't own it.

107
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:18,853
So I figure I'll wash it.
Monica, you got a bucket and soap?

108
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:22,296
Oh, yeah. I got soap
and sponges and rags...

109
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:26,427
and carnauba wax
and polishing compound.

110
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,497
You don't even have a car.

111
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:33,336
I know. Once there was a dirty car in
front of the building, so I washed it.

112
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,243
-And?
-And six others.

113
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,576
There you are.

114
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,815
Yeah, she tops out at 130.

115
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:49,125
That's just in the city.
I get her up to 160 upstate.

116
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,763
Really? You got a place upstate?

117
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,531
Sure.

118
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:58,135
-All right. See you later.
-Okay. Take it easy.

119
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,503
Hey. That's my car.

120
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,440
Really?

121
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,709
Just give me five more minutes.

122
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:09,744
What are you doing?

123
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,113
I found the keys and now
I'm just polishing her up.

124
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,846
-But it's my car.
-Yeah, but it's my wax.

125
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,089
Listen, I don't come to the city much.

126
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,957
I don't know if you're crazy or
if this is some street theater...

127
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,565
but could I have my keys?

128
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,896
Sure. Yeah.
I'll save your parking spot.

129
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,764
I'm not coming back.

130
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,907
-Why not?
-I live upstate.

131
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,035
Yeah, so did I.

132
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,539
I don't know why I was so nervous...

133
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:44,774
and why Frank and Alice complain.
This is easy.

134
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,818
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime,
that's the same.

135
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,420
Check it out!
When the babies wake up...

136
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,492
they can meet Krog!

137
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,330
That thing could put
someone's eye out.

138
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,831
He can do more than that.
He can destroy the universe.

139
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:06,394
They could swallow
one of those little parts.

140
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:10,338
Also, look at his smooth area.
That's just gonna mess them up.

141
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:15,439
It's just not an appropriate toy
for 1-year-olds. Or 30-year-olds.

142
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,516
They won't swallow anything.
You're too overprotective.

143
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:22,484
When I was a kid, my mom used to throw
me into a pile of broken glass.

144
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:26,689
-What?
-Glass, sand, whatever.

145
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,221
Look at little Leslie stretching
in her sleep.

146
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,728
Oh, it's so cute.

147
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,924
I wonder when you stop putting
both legs behind your head.

148
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,330
I can still do that.

149
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,438
How are you still single?

150
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:47,974
I thought about it and maybe you're
right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.

151
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:52,049
-What made you change your mind?
-I swallowed his sonic blaster gun.

152
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,785
How did that happen?

153
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,314
I was trying to prove
that I was right.

154
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,949
And it turns out I was wrong...

155
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,321
and now it's lodged in my throat.

156
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,701
This whole time we were
concentrating on the babies...

157
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,565
and no one was watching Chandler!

158
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,099
You are asking the court
for an annulment?

159
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,212
Yes, Your Honor. Here are
our forms, all filled out.

160
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,610
So based on your petition...

161
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,479
you are seeking an annulment
on the grounds...

162
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,416
that "Mr. Geller
is mentally unstable."

163
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,221
Fine. I'm mentally unstable.

164
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:39,594
And based on the fact that "Mr. Geller
is an intravenous drug user."

165
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:44,066
-What?
-Yes. Heroin and crack.

166
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,496
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.

167
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,232
Well, you would know.

168
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,635
Now, it also says here that you...

169
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,749
"lied about your sexual preference
before marriage."

170
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:58,906
Oh, come on.

171
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,519
Ross, please. I found the magazines.

172
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:06,917
And finally, that you were
"unable to consummate the marriage."

173
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,927
Well, that makes sense since
you're gay and addicted to heroin.

174
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,990
You know, I'm sorry, this is insane.

175
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:19,035
I'm not addicted to heroin,
I'm not gay and there is no problem...

176
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,935
with my ability
to consummate anything.

177
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,271
I'll consummate this marriage
right here, right now!

178
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,810
That won't be necessary.

179
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,582
And when we were dating,
we consummated like bunnies.

180
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:37,855
If you were involved in a serious
relationship, that creates a problem.

181
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:41,390
Rest assured, that relationship
ended two years ago.

182
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,723
Strike "consummated like bunnies"
from the record.

183
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,863
Is there anything in this record
that is actually true?

184
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,197
Well, yes. We got married in Vegas.

185
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:55,306
And the names, I think.

186
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,736
That's not the way
the legal system works.

187
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,609
This process is based on an objective
review of the facts, not of the lies.

188
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,773
Objection!

189
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,444
-It doesn't work like that either.
-Overruled.

190
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,781
Oh, stop it.

191
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:14,353
Based on what I've heard, you certainly
don't qualify for an annulment.

192
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,494
If you don't wanna be together,
file for divorce.

193
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:22,366
That's great. You happy? Look what
you did with your funny, funny form.

194
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:27,005
What? Me? What about you and your
"consummated like bunnies" nonsense?

195
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:32,767
What are you typing that for?
She said we don't get the annulment.

196
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,913
Don't type that. What..

197
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,775
Stop typing!

198
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,206
Stop typing!

199
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,380
"Stop typing, stop typing!"

200
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:46,358
Okay, do you see what you're
keeping me married to?

201
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,888
Get out of my chambers.

202
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,551
Lady, here's the deal.

203
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:54,824
I came here for an annulment and
I'm not leaving here until I get one!

204
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,458
-Would you like a night in jail?
-Thank you for your time.

205
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,520
That Porsche guy took his car back.

206
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,467
But you found the keys to his clothes?

207
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:35,264
No, I just love the way it feels
when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.

208
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,932
They'll think you own one
because of the clothes?

209
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,805
Of course.

210
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,807
Only an idiot would wear this stuff
if he didn't have the car.

211
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,743
That is true.

212
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:53,186
Yeah, but only a genius would
swallow a sonic blaster gun.

213
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,327
Oh, I've been there.

214
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,727
I am gonna go drive my Porsche.

215
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,364
You know you don't actually have one.

216
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:07,528
What are you doing? I'm in character.
Will you talk to her?

217
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,573
I think it just moved.
It's poking me.

218
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,609
We'll go to the emergency room.

219
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,306
No, you can't leave me here with them.
We're babysitting.

220
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,475
The babies are asleep.
You'll be okay on your own.

221
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,087
You can't leave me with them.
We're a team.

222
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,621
We're playing a zone.
They'll triple-team me!

223
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:30,450
He's got plastic in his throat.
We gotta go to the hospital.

224
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:34,655
But a doctor won't be able to help him.
And it's just gonna...

225
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,030
naturally pass through
his system in seven years.

226
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,274
-I think that's gum.
-I'm pretty sure it's gun.

227
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,874
This really hurts. Let's go.

228
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,537
But no! A real man wouldn't
just run to the hospital.

229
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,775
No! What would Krog do?

230
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,985
Why isn't that valet back
with my Porsche?

231
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,483
Maybe because you've got the keys?

232
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,800
-That was totally your fault.
-My fault? You threatened the judge.

233
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,940
You ripped the paper out
of the court reporter's machine!

234
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,474
That was the only way I could
get him to stop typing!

235
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,270
Hi. How are the Gellers?

236
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:28,250
Don't call us that.

237
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:33,019
The judge wouldn't let us get an
annulment. Now we gotta get a divorce!

238
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,959
Did a Porsche throw up on you?

239
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,667
It's "Porsche-a"!

240
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,600
Me taking care of you
is no problem, huh?

241
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,502
You guys feel safe, right?

242
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,838
I'm gonna take that spit bubble
as a "Yeah, I do!"

243
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:57,645
Let's get rid of this dirty diaper.
I'll set you up with a clean one.

244
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:02,019
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
I just have to clean that up.

245
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,951
Because, let's face it,
we're at Monica's.

246
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:11,229
I broke it. All right.
Well, that's just the way things go.

247
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,695
Okay. Good.

248
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,034
Why are there only two of you?

249
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,692
Where's Leslie?

250
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,637
Well, you can't answer.
Leslie? Where are you, Leslie?

251
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,901
Now would be a good time
for your first words.

252
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,980
Well, look at you!

253
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:35,644
You are a little bit mischievous.
My gosh!

254
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,655
Oh, you're a lot mischievous.

255
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,493
Well, it'll dry.

256
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,960
You sit with your brother
and sister now...

257
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,894
who aren't there.

258
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,205
How do you feel?

259
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:07,113
Let's just say Krog will be equipped
to destroy the universe again...

260
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,277
in 12 to 14 hours.

261
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,749
I totally took care of the babies
all by myself.

262
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,894
I fed them, bathed them
and put them to bed.

263
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,757
And protected them from a tornado?

264
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:23,759
Oh, my God!

265
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,461
I know. The babies are asleep.

266
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,206
Phoebe, what happened here?

267
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,366
I did it. I took care
of the babies all by myself.

268
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:36,640
-But my apartment!
-Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.

269
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,348
But the mess!

270
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:43,386
Is not as important as the fact
that Phoebe took care of the babies.

271
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,318
You're right. I shouldn't freak out.

272
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,894
This is what it'll be like
when we have babies. When's that?

273
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,129
Phoebe, look at this mess!

274
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,675
Oh, honey. Thank God you're home.
I was getting worried.

275
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,515
I picked up the divorce papers.

276
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:16,950
I've already signed everything.
I put little X's where you need to sign.

277
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,920
Little X's. Great!
That makes up for everything.

278
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,697
You know, you've done
a lot of stupid stuff too, okay?

279
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,731
Name one stupid thing that is
as stupid as this one.

280
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,529
How about you flew to London
to stop my wedding?

281
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,467
You told me you loved me
after I was married.

282
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:39,303
Wait, that was different. I did those
things because I was in love with you.

283
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,968
Right.

284
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,409
You're right. That's very different.

285
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,020
So let's just sign the papers.

286
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:53,649
What?

287
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,122
Nothing.

288
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,528
Okay, can we just sign, please?

289
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,442
Congratulations.

290
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,704
Okay, wait, Ross. Wait a minute.

291
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,045
I kind of have a little confession.

292
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,651
What?

293
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,515
Well, you know,
this whole marriage thing.

294
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,584
Kind of my idea.

295
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,286
Excuse me?

296
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,090
Remember how we were too drunk to
remember anything when we were married?

297
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,928
I didn't really wanna say anything,
but it just kept coming back to me.

298
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:45,338
We were in the casino and you thought
it'd be funny to eat a lot of grapes.

299
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:51,013
And I thought it would be funnier
if we got married.

300
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:55,643
So as a compromise we decided
first to get married and then...

301
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:59,279
to eat a lot of grapes.

302
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,760
Sorry I got us into this whole thing.

303
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,866
So then if you think about it...

304
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:13,027
this is all your fault.

305
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,637
Yeah, don't push it, though.

306
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,236
I gotta say...

307
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,372
I know I divorce a lot of women.

308
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,553
Never thought I'd be divorcing you.

309
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,287
I know.

310
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:36,458
I always thought if we got married,
that'd be the one that stuck.

311
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,629
And it wouldn't be a secret...

312
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,331
and we wouldn't have our
wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.

313
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,301
Did I even treat?

314
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:51,272
No, it was on the house.
It was a newlywed special.

315
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,675
That may be the most depressing thing
I've heard.

316
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,441
I should get these
to my lawyer's office.

317
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,615
Thanks for taking care of all this.

318
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:04,983
No problem.

319
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,761
-I'm gonna need a copy of those.
-Totally.

320
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:28,007
Careful around my Porsche!

321
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:30,907
Hi, Joey.

322
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,847
Hey. How you doing?

323
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,015
He has the most amazing Porsche
under there.

324
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,352
I'd show you, but I just tucked
her in. She's sleeping.

325
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,054
Would you like to go for a drink?
