1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,766
What am I sitting on?

2
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:07,739
Top of the world?

3
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,837
Dock of the bay?

4
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:11,935
I'm out.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,038
Oh, undies!

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,050
Whose are they?

7
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:23,414
-Whose are they?
-Not mine.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,351
Joey's!
Got to be Joey's.

9
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,185
They're mine.

10
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:34,262
See, Joey's.
They're Joe-Joe-Joey's.

11
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,365
Why are they here?

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,629
I don't know.

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,373
I'm Joey.

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,468
I'm disgusting.

15
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,441
I take my underwear off
in other people's homes.

16
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:52,443
Get them out of here.
What's wrong with you?

17
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,047
-Take them!
-I got them.

18
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:01,252
You can touch them.
They're yours.

19
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,124
Chandler? A word?

20
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,842
I'm tired of covering for you two.
This has got to stop.

21
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,810
Tighty-whiteys?
What are you, 8?

22
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,411
Thank you, Joey, so much.

23
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,155
You're not welcome, okay?

24
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,251
Look, I hate this.
You guys keep embarrassing me.

25
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:38,021
Yesterday, Rachel found
your razor in our bathroom.

26
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:42,360
I said it was mine, and that
I was playing a woman in a play.

27
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,369
Then one thing led
to another, and....

28
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,871
And around the ankles,
that is a tough spot.

29
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,810
It was.
All right, listen

30
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,450
All this lying has been
hard on us too.

31
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,280
Yeah, I bet all the sex
makes it easier.

32
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,648
Yeah, actually.

33
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,425
Meanwhile, I get Rachel shoving your
underwear in my face...

34
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,895
...and asking when she can
come see me star in Ugly Woman.

35
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,732
We'll be more careful.

36
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,905
We don't want them to know
because it's going really well.

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,700
And maybe it's going well
because it's a secret.

38
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,469
It sounds weird,
but we're so bad at relationships.

39
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,746
-We are. Help us!
-Help!

40
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:35,381
All right.
But you do it with me once.

41
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,753
-Joey!
-Didn't think so.

42
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,529
The One With Ross' Sandwich

43
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:35,338
-Can we please just drop this?
-But I don't get it.

44
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:39,383
Does anybody else just take off
their underwear when they're hot?

45
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:44,914
What are you reading?

46
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:46,647
Wuthering Heights.

47
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,920
I have to finish it by tomorrow
for my literature class.

48
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,428
You're taking a class?
That's so cool.

49
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,769
I really liked
that Lamaze class I took.

50
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,699
I thought this time I'd go
for something more intellectual...

51
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,305
...with a less painful final exam.

52
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,201
That sounds like fun.

53
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,707
Oh, you should come with me!

54
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,109
Then I'll have someone to sit with.

55
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,182
Do you have time to read it?

56
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,377
I read it in school.

57
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:20,615
This is going to be so much fun!
I have to finish.

58
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,362
But what time does the class start?

59
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,927
What's wrong, buddy?

60
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,539
Someone at work ate my sandwich.

61
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,568
What did the police say?

62
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,549
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.

63
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,648
I can't believe someone ate it.

64
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,113
It's just a sandwich.

65
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,945
Just a sandwich?

66
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,122
I am 30 years old, okay?

67
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,723
I'll be divorced twice and
I got evicted.

68
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,157
That sandwich was
the only good thing in my life!

69
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:01,231
Someone ate the only good thing
going on in my life!

70
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,498
That's a nice sweater vest.

71
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,103
I have enough
for one more sandwich.

72
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,902
I was going to eat it myself, but....

73
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:17,043
Mon, that would be incredible.
Thank you so much.

74
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,247
I still can't believe
someone ate it!

75
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,686
Look, I left a note and everything.

76
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,291
"Knock-knock."
"Who's there?"

77
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,357
"Ross Geller's lunch."

78
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,288
"Ross Geller's lunch, who?"

79
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,396
"Ross Geller's lunch.
Please don't take me. Okay?"

80
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,368
I'm surprised
you didn't wear it home.

81
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,870
Want to keep your food?
Scare people off.

82
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,636
I learned that on the street.

83
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,035
Really?

84
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,411
What would you say, Phoebe?

85
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,746
Stuff like:
"Keep your mitts off my grub."

86
00:05:56,322 --> 00:06:00,782
Do you picture Phoebe on the street
with the entire cast of Annie?

87
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,330
This'll keep them away
from your stuff.

88
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,773
Phoebe, you are a badass!

89
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,903
Someday I'll tell you
how I stabbed the cop.

90
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,609
He stabbed me first!

91
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:29,018
The Bronte sisters were remarkable women
for their time.

92
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,620
They lived in a patriarchal society.

93
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,758
Sorry I'm late,
but I left late.

94
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,423
So, what is the book about?

95
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,360
Didn't you read it
in high school?

96
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,661
I started it, but then
there was this pep rally.

97
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,668
And I was on top of the pyramid.

98
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,663
But anyway...

99
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,864
...what's the book about?

100
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,841
It's a tragic love story
between Cathy and Heathcliff.

101
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,981
It takes place on these
creepy moors in England.

102
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:02,313
Which I think represent the wildness
of Heathcliff's character.

103
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,216
I totally get symbolism.

104
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,884
How would you characterize
the theme of this book?

105
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,028
Let's see....
Rachel Greene?

106
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:20,404
I would have to say
that it's a tragic love story.

107
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,373
That's sort of a given...

108
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,544
...but, yes.
Anyone else?

109
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:27,835
Symbolism!

110
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,249
And the wildness of the moors...

111
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,987
...which I think, is mirrored...

112
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,658
...in the wildness
of Heathcliff's character.

113
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,721
Excellent! What Rachel
has shrewdly observed here....

114
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,063
You completely stole my answer!

115
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,063
Honey, that was pretty obvious.

116
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,566
How would you know?
You didn't read it!

117
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,941
What do you think?
You in the blue shirt?

118
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:05,243
I think that yours is a question
with many possible answers.

119
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,415
Would you care to venture one?

120
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,520
Would you care to venture one?

121
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,854
Are you just repeating me?

122
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,619
Are you just repeating me?

123
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,424
All right. Let's move on.

124
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,390
Okay, then.

125
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,939
Why didn't you say
you hadn't read the book?

126
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,643
I didn't want him
to think I was stupid.

127
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,972
That was really embarrassing,
what happened to you.

128
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:41,915
Your note?

129
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,377
Amazing!

130
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,255
Not only did no one
touch my sandwich...

131
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,290
...but people at work are
actually afraid of me.

132
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,558
A guy called me "Mental."

133
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,264
"Mental Geller."

134
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,563
I've always wanted
a cool nickname like that.

135
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:01,498
The best you got in high school
was "Wet Pants Geller."

136
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,504
It was the water fountain, okay?!

137
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:06,669
Anyway...

138
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,405
...people are writing
reports for me...

139
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,141
...pushing back deadlines
to fit my schedule.

140
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,614
I tell you,
you get tough with people...

141
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,619
...and you can get
anything you want.

142
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,827
Hey, Tribbiani!
Give me that coffee! Now!

143
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,262
This was really fun.

144
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,674
I've been wondering
if you'd ask me out.

145
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,274
So you still wondering?

146
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,340
No. We just went out.

147
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,507
You're smart.

148
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,617
I like that.

149
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,355
Oh, candles!

150
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,023
What is that, a blanket?

151
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,825
A video camera?
Oh, my God!

152
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:10,401
I can't believe you thought you'd
tape us having sex on the first date!

153
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,545
Joey, is what she just said....

154
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,048
Oh, my God!

155
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,755
You're actually going

156
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,220
What is going on here?

157
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:37,097
And with Chandler in the next room.
What are you, sick?

158
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,873
I'm Joey.

159
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,743
I mean, I'm disgusting.

160
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,614
I make low-budget adult films.

161
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,188
You promised to be more careful!

162
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,526
The good Joey name's been
dragged through the mud!

163
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:13,761
We're so sorry.

164
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,473
I'm telling everyone.

165
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:20,476
It's the only explanation that
doesn't make me look like a pig!

166
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,507
No, there's a better explanation.

167
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:26,240
Tell them you had to make
an adult film for your...

168
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,716
...adult film class.

169
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,649
I like that.
But no!

170
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,190
How does that explain
my underwear at your place?

171
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:37,854
I don't know.

172
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,665
Get ready to come out
of the non-gay closet.

173
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,993
I promise to come up with something.
Just give us time.

174
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,362
All right.

175
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,701
But it better make me
look really good.

176
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,410
And another thing:

177
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,245
The video camera?

178
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,743
Nice!

179
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,653
May I have a word?

180
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,191
Of course, Donald.

181
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:15,363
We've been getting reports
of very angry behavior on your part.

182
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,033
-What?
-Threatening letters...

183
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,167
...refusal to meet deadlines.

184
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,008
Apparently people now
call you Mental.

185
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,939
We want you to speak
to a psychiatrist.

186
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,119
You don't understand.
This is so silly.

187
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,546
This is all just
because of a sandwich.

188
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,057
A sandwich?

189
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:45,861
You see, my sister makes
these amazing turkey sandwiches.

190
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:51,135
Her secret is, she puts an extra slice
of gravy-soaked bread in the middle.

191
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,234
I call it "The Moistmaker."

192
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,232
Anyway, I put my sandwich
in the fridge....

193
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,472
Oh, you know what?

194
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:00,939
I'm sorry.

195
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,108
I believe I ate that.

196
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,086
You ate my sandwich?

197
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,817
A simple mistake.
It can happen to anyone.

198
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,115
Oh, really?

199
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:20,759
Did you confuse it with your own
turkey sandwich with a Moistmaker?

200
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,564
Do you, perhaps, remember...

201
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,331
...seeing a note on top of it?

202
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:32,635
There may have been a joke
or limerick of some kind.

203
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,743
That said it was...

204
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,778
...my sandwich!

205
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,117
Now, calm down.

206
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:42,453
Look in my office.
Some may be in the trash.

207
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:50,293
It was quite large.
I had to throw most of it away.

208
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,027
You threw my sandwich away?

209
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,033
My sandwich?!

210
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,466
What's this book about?

211
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,042
You didn't read it, either?

212
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,771
I was going to, but I accidentally
read something else.

213
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,844
Vogue.

214
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,651
So tell me about Jane Eyre.

215
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,447
No, read it yourself.

216
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,524
Come on,
don't be such a goody-goody.

217
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:23,689
Fine.

218
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,024
All right.
So, Jane Eyre?

219
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,893
First, you'd think she's a woman,
but she's not.

220
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,534
She's a cyborg.

221
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,505
A cyborg?
Isn't that like a robot?

222
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,512
This book was light years
ahead of its time.

223
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,516
Sorry I'm late.
Let's get started.

224
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,144
What did you think of Jane Eyre?

225
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:53,650
Rachel and I were discussing it,
and she had very interesting insights.

226
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,327
Go ahead, Rachel.

227
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:58,991
Thank you, Phoebe.

228
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,160
What struck me most
when reading Jane Eyre...

229
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,533
...was how the book was
so ahead of its time.

230
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:11,573
If you're talking about feminism,
I think you're right.

231
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:17,070
Well, feminism, yes.
But also the robots.

232
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,922
Since that video camera thing
didn't work out...

233
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:33,230
...I thought that I would give you
just a little preview.

234
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,965
You're naked!

235
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,259
I know!

236
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,283
Are you okay?

237
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:58,921
I'm fine.

238
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,820
I saw a psychiatrist at work today.

239
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,250
Why?

240
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,495
On account of my rage.

241
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:10,261
Which, if I may say,
right now is out of control.

242
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,832
He gave me a pill for it.

243
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,332
A pill?

244
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:20,076
When the psychiatrist told me
to take a leave of absence...

245
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:24,612
...because I yelled at my boss,
I started to get worked up again.

246
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,512
So he offered me a tranquilizer.

247
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,017
And I thought it was a good idea.

248
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,813
So I took it.

249
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,590
They're making you take
time off work?

250
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,160
And you're okay with that?

251
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,930
I don't know.

252
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,990
It's going to be weird
not having a job for a while.

253
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,431
But I definitely don't care
about my sandwich.

254
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,038
I hate it when they make me see
the shrink at my office.

255
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:57,080
He's always like, "Your colleagues will
like you better if you like yourself better."

256
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,807
Who needs that?

257
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,384
-You do.
-I know.

258
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:07,716
It's so embarrassing! I can't believe
you let me go on like that!

259
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,325
I'm sorry.

260
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,460
It was so funny when you compared
Jane Eyre to Robocop.

261
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,729
That was not funny!

262
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,567
I snapped, okay?
You weren't taking the class seriously.

263
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,776
Come on!
What is the big deal?

264
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,708
I thought it'd be something
we could do together.

265
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,345
I thought it would be fun.

266
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,913
Fun is good.

267
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,142
But I also wanted to learn.

268
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:38,880
People talk about what they learned
in high school. I never went.

269
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:44,053
So you really wanted to learn.

270
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,100
You know, Phoebe,
I just wanted to have fun.

271
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,434
You know who should go?

272
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,762
I know! I know! I know!

273
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,239
Monica, you asked the question.

274
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,293
Oh, my God, that's Monica!

275
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:26,301
You get away from me,
you sick, sick, sicko!

276
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,299
What's going on?

277
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,932
Joey has got a secret peephole!

278
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,242
-Oh, no!
-Yes, he has a naked picture of Monica!

279
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:40,009
He takes naked pictures of us, then
he eats chicken and looks at them!

280
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,057
Oh! Dude, that's my sister!

281
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,588
Give me that!

282
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,192
Wait! Everybody calm down, okay?

283
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:54,729
Let's give our friend a chance
to explain why he's such a big pervert!

284
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,526
I am not a pervert, okay?

285
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,102
It's just....

286
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,361
I just kind of....

287
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,136
I think I can explain this.

288
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,706
Thank you.

289
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,877
Joey's a sex addict.

290
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,045
What?! No, I'm not!

291
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,446
It's okay! It's good!

292
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,087
It's a disease.

293
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,621
I am not a sex addict!

294
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,293
Yes, you are!

295
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,697
That's the only way
to explain all this stuff!

296
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,662
No, it isn't. It's not.

297
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,461
Because you could also explain it
with the truth!

298
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,797
What is the truth?

299
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,769
-What's up?
-What's going on?

300
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,647
I slept with Monica.

301
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,347
Well, let's see what everybody
thinks of that.

302
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,255
You slept with my sister?

303
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,834
Yes, but it was

304
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,161
We just did it once, in London.

305
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,197
This is not good for my rage.

306
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,271
Is this true?

307
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,776
Of course, it's true.

308
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:21,947
How else would you explain all the
weird stuff that's been going on?

309
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,511
Yes, it's true.

310
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,551
If it happened once, how come we
found your underwear in our apartment?

311
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:36,959
That was the underwear
I was wearing that night in London.

312
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,533
Right, Monica?

313
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,841
I guess I wanted to keep it...

314
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,303
...as a souvenir.

315
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,207
My God, Monica!

316
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,549
Are you sure you're not
just a sex addict?

317
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:00,853
If anyone's a sex addict here,
it's Monica.

318
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:06,023
She has been trying to get me back
in the sack ever since London!

319
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,932
That's why she gave you
a naked picture of herself.

320
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,567
That makes sense.

321
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,595
And the video camera?

322
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:23,576
I guess I set up the video camera
to try and entice Joey.

323
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,851
But, sadly, I could not be enticed.

324
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,989
Monica, this has to stop now.

325
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,151
I know, I know.

326
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:40,822
I know. I will, and I would appreciate
if we all could just...

327
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,662
...drop it immediately, and forever.

328
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,597
Okay. That is, if you can resist me.

329
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:53,439
-I'll give it my best shot.
-Good luck.

330
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,908
Unbelievable!

331
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,809
You really kept Joey's underwear?

332
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,518
Why? Why would you do that?

333
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,755
I'm Monica.

334
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,359
I'm disgusting.

335
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,993
I stalk guys and keep their underpants.

336
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:23,106
I think we've all learned
who's disgusting and who's not.

337
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:29,080
Now, I'm going to get back
to my bucket.

338
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,746
I'm only eating the skin,
so the chicken's up for grabs.

339
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,682
You were making a good point.

340
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,860
I mean, till you got cut off.

341
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,563
What's up with that girl Monica?

342
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,663
I don't know.
I didn't come with her.

343
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,204
Hey, everybody!
Everybody, guess what!

344
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,736
I just convinced Carl
to give us a test.

345
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,032
Test?

346
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,142
Come on!
Tests make us all better learners!

347
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,976
Oh, yeah!
We should have essay questions!
