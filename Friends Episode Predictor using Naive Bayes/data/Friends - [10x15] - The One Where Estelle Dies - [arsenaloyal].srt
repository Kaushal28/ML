00:00:01,179 --> 00:00:02,373
<i>Previously on</i> Friends:

2
00:00:02,548 --> 00:00:05,608
- How did the job stuff go?
- He offered me one!

3
00:00:05,784 --> 00:00:10,084
You know what? This calls
for a bottle of lsrael's finest!

4
00:00:11,423 --> 00:00:13,618
The job is in Paris.

5
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:21,923
Oh, God, please,
somebody say something.

6
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:26,061
So if you take this job,
you'll be moving to Paris?

7
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:29,105
Or facing a bitch of a commute.

8
00:00:30,576 --> 00:00:36,037
I know, it's huge, and it's scary
and it's really far away from you guys.

9
00:00:36,214 --> 00:00:38,705
But this is such
an incredible opportunity for me.

10
00:00:38,884 --> 00:00:41,478
I've already told them about
our situation with Emma...

11
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:45,953
...and they said they'll do whatever
we need to make us feel comfortable.

12
00:00:46,124 --> 00:00:49,787
I mean, I'll fly back and forth,
they'll fly you out. Anything we want.

13
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:52,988
My boss said I might be getting
a new lamp in my cubicle.

14
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:04,206
- All right. We'll work it out.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

15
00:01:05,577 --> 00:01:09,980
- You sure this is what you want?
- I think it is.

16
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:17,686
- What's going on?
- I got a really incredible job offer.

17
00:01:17,856 --> 00:01:19,915
- Hey, great! All right!
- Good for you!

18
00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:22,060
- It's in Paris.
- What?

19
00:01:22,227 --> 00:01:28,132
No, no, no! No, no, no!
No, too much is changing, okay?

20
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,996
First Phoebe getting married.
Congratulations.

21
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:35,469
And then these two move in
to a stupid house in the stupid suburbs.

22
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:40,510
- Earlier, you said you'd be supportive.
- It comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it!

23
00:01:41,913 --> 00:01:44,473
You guys, this is really, really
important to me.

24
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,084
It means a lot if you could try
to get onboard.

25
00:01:47,252 --> 00:01:50,881
- Of course we can. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

26
00:01:51,123 --> 00:01:52,488
Joey?

27
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:56,992
No, my hugs are reserved
for people staying in America!

28
00:01:57,162 --> 00:01:58,390
Joey, it would mean--

29
00:01:58,563 --> 00:02:01,691
No! Get your France-going arms
away from me!

30
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:06,832
- Are you okay with this?
- Well, it makes me feel sad, but--

31
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:09,166
- Talking to Ross.
- I see.

32
00:02:11,243 --> 00:02:15,077
Rachel moving to another country?
Not being able to see her every day?

33
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:17,272
How could I be okay with this?

34
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:19,917
But what are we gonna do?
She really needs this job.

35
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:25,819
Do you think if Ralph Lauren offered her
her old job back, she would take it?

36
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:27,049
How's that gonna happen?

37
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:30,820
Is this the best way to use
one of your three magic wishes?

38
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:33,965
Like, I don't know,
I could talk to her boss. Yeah.

39
00:02:34,132 --> 00:02:37,568
I met him at that Christmas party.
I mean, we really hit it off.

40
00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:42,196
- The guy who kept calling you "Ron"?
- I didn't say we were brothers!

41
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:45,941
Technically, this is not a hug.

42
00:03:38,163 --> 00:03:39,790
You read the obituaries?

43
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:42,024
Yeah. Well, I got a few curses on people.

44
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,964
I just like to see how they're coming.

45
00:03:46,938 --> 00:03:49,099
- Hey, Phoebe. Hey.
- Hi.

46
00:03:49,274 --> 00:03:52,801
The house next door to the one that
we're buying just went on the market.

47
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:55,242
I wanna take a look at it,
but Chandler doesn't.

48
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:56,641
We close escrow tomorrow.

49
00:03:56,815 --> 00:03:59,807
Seeing another house can only
confuse us. We're easily confused.

50
00:03:59,985 --> 00:04:02,317
We're not very bright.

51
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:05,684
But what if it's better than ours?
Shouldn't we look?

52
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:07,222
What do you think, Pheebs?

53
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:12,796
Well, I think that shirt makes you look like
you should work at a Baskin-Robbins.

54
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,631
Anyway....

55
00:04:18,937 --> 00:04:22,373
- Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
- Yeah.

56
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,168
- She died.
- You're kidding!

57
00:04:24,342 --> 00:04:26,810
- That's terrible.
- Yeah, last Saturday.

58
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:32,610
Wow! She was the first black man
to fly solo across the Atlantic!

59
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:37,711
- Wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
- Oh, yeah?

60
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:42,219
- Yeah, she was just an agent.
- Joey's gonna be so upset.

61
00:04:42,427 --> 00:04:47,023
I know. He always wanted to be the
first black man to cross the Atlantic.

62
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,961
We cannot tell Joey about this.

63
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:52,695
He's already flipping out
about everything changing.

64
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:54,668
This'll push him over the edge.

65
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,468
- You don't think we should tell him?
- Not for a while.

66
00:04:57,642 --> 00:05:00,611
Let's just give him a few days
to get used to everything else.

67
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:02,178
What if he reads the paper?

68
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:06,215
Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown,
I think we're okay.

69
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:15,860
- May I help you?
- Yeah. I'm a friend of Rachel Green's.

70
00:05:16,027 --> 00:05:19,258
Actually, we met at the Christmas party
about two years ago.

71
00:05:19,431 --> 00:05:23,561
- Oh, right. Don?
- Close. Ron.

72
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:27,205
Well, what can I do for you?

73
00:05:27,372 --> 00:05:32,105
Well, I'm here to see
if you'll give Rachel her job back.

74
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:35,377
Did she ask you to come here
and do this?

75
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:37,208
First I have to get you to agree...

76
00:05:37,382 --> 00:05:40,351
...then we'll see
if she wants to come back.

77
00:05:41,086 --> 00:05:43,111
Wow, that is tempting.

78
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:48,522
She loved her job here. Let's face it,
you're not gonna find anyone...

79
00:05:48,693 --> 00:05:51,161
...who did it as well as she did.
Isn't that true?

80
00:05:51,663 --> 00:05:55,394
- She is good.
- I took a shot there.

81
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:58,268
But I'm sorry,
there's nothing I can do.

82
00:05:58,536 --> 00:06:02,165
Oh, that's not true.
There's nothing I want to do.

83
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,835
I see.

84
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:07,909
Thanks very much.

85
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,048
- Is this your son?
- Yeah, his name is Ross.

86
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:24,855
- What?
- Nothing, it's just that it's close to Ron.

87
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:30,467
Does little Ross like dinosaurs,
by any chance?

88
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:33,627
Yeah, they're all he talks about. Why?

89
00:06:34,172 --> 00:06:39,007
How would he like to come with me
to the Museum of Natural History...

90
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:42,908
...after everyone else has left,
just the two of us...

91
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:45,845
...and he can touch anything he wants?

92
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:54,690
I just heard it how you must
have heard it, and that's not good.

93
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:57,191
Let me start again.
I'm a paleontologist.

94
00:06:57,362 --> 00:07:03,301
You'll be there with us, and the
touching refers only to bones-- fossils!

95
00:07:06,438 --> 00:07:11,034
- You could really arrange that?
- You let Rachel come back and it's done.

96
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:15,009
I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world.

97
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,910
Yes! Thank you! This is great!
Thank you so much.

98
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,643
I swear, your kid's gonna have
the time of his life.

99
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,810
That's great.
I worry about little Ross.

100
00:07:22,988 --> 00:07:26,480
He's always reading, collecting rocks
and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.

101
00:07:26,658 --> 00:07:28,819
He'll be fine!

102
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:32,663
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

103
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:35,800
- Everything okay?
- I'm just mad at my agent.

104
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,594
Estelle? Why?

105
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:40,932
There's a part in this TV movie
that I would be perfect for...

106
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:45,202
...and I didn't even get put up for it.
She better have a good reason.

107
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:47,977
I'm guessing she does.

108
00:07:48,146 --> 00:07:51,877
Well, I wanna hear it,
because she keeps doing this.

109
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,019
No, wait, wait, wait!
All right, I gotta go.

110
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:59,555
Just listen. Promise me that you will
wait a minute before you call her.

111
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:01,487
Well, okay. Why?

112
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:07,529
Because a promise between friends
means never having to give a reason.

113
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:14,165
I love that saying!

114
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,543
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.

115
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:28,819
I was just gonna call you.
That's weird.

116
00:08:28,987 --> 00:08:32,718
It's a little coincidental, but believable.

117
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:37,657
Listen, I'm sure you're wondering
why I didn't get you...

118
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:40,127
...an audition for that TV movie.

119
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:41,595
Yeah, actually I am.

120
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:44,735
I guess I dropped the ball there.

121
00:08:46,137 --> 00:08:50,540
That's it? You know, it seems like
all you do lately is drop the ball.

122
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,734
Don't take that tone with me.
Who do you think you are?

123
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:59,009
Alan Lemon, the first black man
to fly solo across the Atlantic?

124
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,453
No, look, all I'm saying is
you're my agent...

125
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:06,647
...and you're not getting me
any auditions and I'm tired of it.

126
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:07,951
What are you saying?

127
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:11,926
I'm saying that this isn't working
for me anymore, okay, Estelle?

128
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:13,826
You're fired. Goodbye.

129
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:19,931
Man, tough week for Estelle.

130
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:24,339
- Hi.
- Hi.

131
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:26,977
Emma left her stuffed T. Rex
at my house.

132
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:31,946
- You know she can't sleep without it.
- Well, she's asleep now.

133
00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:35,348
- Stop forcing that thing on her.
- Okay.

134
00:09:35,587 --> 00:09:38,112
You're not gonna believe
what happened to me today!

135
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:41,383
Ralph Lauren called
and gave me my job back!

136
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:45,757
- No!
- I mean, it was the weirdest thing.

137
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,899
They fire me and then out of nowhere,
they just hire me back.

138
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:52,036
I mean, that place must just be
falling apart without me!

139
00:09:52,203 --> 00:09:55,604
- So you're not going to Paris?
- No, I'm still going!

140
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:01,472
What?

141
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,773
Well, when the Louis Vuitton people
found out...

142
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:08,407
...that Ralph Lauren wanted me back,
they offered me more money!

143
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:11,077
Ross, isn't that great?

144
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:24,660
Hi. We're buying the house next door.
Could we just take a look around?

145
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:28,670
Sure, I'm showing it to someone else
right now, but please, look around.

146
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:31,373
I feel like we're cheating
on our house.

147
00:10:31,843 --> 00:10:34,676
If we cheat, shouldn't it be
with a hot, younger house...

148
00:10:34,846 --> 00:10:37,440
...that does stuff
that our house won't do?

149
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:42,315
Ours is so much better!

150
00:10:42,487 --> 00:10:46,355
This living room is smaller,
the dining room looks like a cave.

151
00:10:46,524 --> 00:10:47,855
What a hole!

152
00:10:48,026 --> 00:10:51,484
- So, what do you think?
- Love it!

153
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,796
We already have one offer. I think
the lady upstairs will make another one.

154
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:57,901
They could be our neighbors.
What are they like?

155
00:10:58,069 --> 00:11:01,197
The woman upstairs is nice.
She and her husband have two kids.

156
00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:07,038
- He's on Wall Street, and she's a--
- Oh... my... God!

157
00:11:16,788 --> 00:11:18,346
Sure.

158
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:25,291
Hey, Joey, you wanna
come with me to--?

159
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:27,125
Are you okay?

160
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:30,461
Yeah, I just feel bad
about firing Estelle.

161
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:33,069
This has gotta be killing her.

162
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:38,373
No, that wouldn't kill her.

163
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:40,909
A coronary embolism might.

164
00:11:41,246 --> 00:11:44,943
I don't know. She's gotta be
taking it hard. I was her only client.

165
00:11:45,116 --> 00:11:47,243
Except for this guy who eats paper.

166
00:11:47,418 --> 00:11:50,410
And I'm guessing he eats more money
than he makes.

167
00:11:50,922 --> 00:11:55,586
Look, I know she's not a great agent,
but she did stick with me for 10 years.

168
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:59,927
- I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
- No, no, no! Don't call her.

169
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:03,795
- You wait for her to call you.
- Why?

170
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:08,831
Because patience is the road
to understanding.

171
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:13,733
Which is the key to a happy heart.

172
00:12:16,047 --> 00:12:18,572
You blow me away.

173
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,742
All right, so promise you're
gonna wait for her to call you?

174
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,079
- I promise.
- Okay.

175
00:12:23,254 --> 00:12:27,554
And that means never having
to give a reason.

176
00:12:30,962 --> 00:12:33,590
What a small world!

177
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:36,859
And yet I never run into Beyoncé.

178
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,035
You two know each other?

179
00:12:40,204 --> 00:12:43,503
We go way back. Before Monica
made an honest man out of him...

180
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:47,702
...Chandler used to be
my little love muffin.

181
00:12:49,347 --> 00:12:51,406
Don't judge me.

182
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,645
Why not? I do.

183
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:57,947
So are you guys thinking
of getting this house too?

184
00:12:58,122 --> 00:13:01,319
Are we gonna have a bidding war?
I better warn you, I'm a toughie.

185
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:04,455
Don't-- Don't-- Don't--

186
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:06,153
Don't do that.

187
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:09,863
No, actually, we are buying
the house next door.

188
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:12,602
Why?

189
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:17,073
I don't know why.

190
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:20,802
Oh, that decides it, then!
I was on the fence.

191
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:23,572
But knowing that you two
would be our neighbors?

192
00:13:23,748 --> 00:13:25,978
Now we have to get it!

193
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,449
Ellen, we're gonna talk numbers.

194
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:35,386
This cannot be happening.

195
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,994
The realtor said another couple
made an offer.

196
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:42,826
Maybe the Janices won't get it!
Maybe the other couple will.

197
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,437
The only way that'll happen is
if the other couple are the Hitlers!

198
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,143
Okay, okay! All right,
what if we get both houses?

199
00:13:53,311 --> 00:13:56,508
- We can turn this one into a guesthouse!
- That's a great idea!

200
00:13:56,681 --> 00:13:59,081
By the way,
I don't mean to sound distasteful...

201
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,219
...but when did you start
crapping money?

202
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:04,912
- You come up with an idea.
- All right.

203
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:08,490
We've still got three hours
till escrow closes on our house.

204
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:10,854
- We can still get out.
- But we love our house.

205
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:13,053
Will we love it so much
with her next door?

206
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:15,324
And she's gonna be louder
out here too!

207
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,958
Just the crickets
and, "Oh... my... God!"

208
00:14:19,737 --> 00:14:23,503
Okay. But if we don't get this house,
she'll still show up wherever we go.

209
00:14:23,674 --> 00:14:26,734
At least if she's here,
it eliminates the element of surprise.

210
00:14:26,911 --> 00:14:29,402
Never again will you have to hear
the three words...

211
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,640
...that make your balls jump back up
inside your body!

212
00:14:38,356 --> 00:14:42,918
Well, we have to do something.
We can't have her living next door.

213
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,394
Oh, that does it too.

214
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,700
Who is it?

215
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:58,432
It's me. Ron.

216
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:02,905
Look, I know Rachel turned you down...

217
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,982
...but I think there's a way you might
be able to get her to come back.

218
00:15:07,151 --> 00:15:13,420
This may surprise you, but rehiring
fired employees is not my main job.

219
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,292
Just hear me out.

220
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,760
How would you feel
about offering her a raise?

221
00:15:24,135 --> 00:15:26,000
Not good, Ron.

222
00:15:27,038 --> 00:15:29,336
Perhaps I can persuade you.

223
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,168
What if you could give your son...

224
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:38,145
...this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.

225
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:47,450
Wow! That's pretty cool.

226
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:51,123
So? Do we have a deal?

227
00:15:51,762 --> 00:15:54,890
- Okay, you got it.
- Yes! Yes!

228
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:58,194
This is gonna make me very popular.

229
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:01,463
Believe me, the ladies, they love it.

230
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:07,473
I meant with my son.

231
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:10,810
Good, because the ladies,
not so much.

232
00:16:18,222 --> 00:16:23,524
<i>Joey, this is Al Zebooker,</i>
<i>the guy who eats paper.</i>

233
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:26,987
<i>I'm sure you've heard</i>
<i>that Estelle passed away.</i>

234
00:16:27,164 --> 00:16:29,792
<i>I wanted to let you know</i>
<i>there's a memorial for her...</i>

235
00:16:29,967 --> 00:16:33,494
<i>...at the Westside Chapel</i>
<i>tomorrow at 1 O.</i>

236
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:35,502
<i>Hope you can make it.</i>

237
00:16:36,474 --> 00:16:38,465
Oh, my God.

238
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:50,246
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.

239
00:16:55,693 --> 00:16:57,217
Estelle?

240
00:16:57,395 --> 00:17:02,765
Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that
there's no hard feelings for firing me.

241
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:11,438
Okay. I just--
I can't believe you're calling me.

242
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:13,633
I didn't think I should just drop by.

243
00:17:13,811 --> 00:17:16,712
No, no! Don't drop by! Don't drop by!

244
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:22,615
Anyway, you did what you had to do.
I'm okay.

245
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:25,153
Can I ask you something?

246
00:17:26,223 --> 00:17:27,656
What's it like there?

247
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,427
It's all right.

248
00:17:31,596 --> 00:17:33,587
Look, kiddo, I gotta go.

249
00:17:33,764 --> 00:17:36,961
Good luck with the career.
You're gonna be huge!

250
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:40,797
Thanks for everything, Estelle. Bye.

251
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,966
"Out of area." Boy, I'll say!

252
00:17:50,081 --> 00:17:53,676
Well, I just talked to Sid.

253
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:56,513
We are definitely putting in
an offer on the house.

254
00:17:56,721 --> 00:17:58,655
And I'll bet we get it!

255
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:01,656
The Hitlers will be so disappointed.

256
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,163
All right, I gotta run.
Tell Monica I say goodbye.

257
00:18:07,331 --> 00:18:09,993
I'll see you later, neighbor.

258
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:12,093
Wait!

259
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:17,204
I just want you to know that
I'm so happy you're going to be here.

260
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,536
Oh, me too!

261
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:21,473
Because...

262
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:23,511
...that way...

263
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:26,979
...we can pick up where we left off.

264
00:18:31,355 --> 00:18:33,721
I never stopped loving you.

265
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:36,724
- Oh... my--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

266
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:41,493
I want you.

267
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,361
I need you.

268
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:48,494
I must have you,
Janice Litman-Goralnik neé Hosenstein.

269
00:18:51,342 --> 00:18:54,834
Chandler, what are you talking about?

270
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:58,873
Now that you live next door,
we can be together every day.

271
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,541
Sid and Monica never have
to know a thing.

272
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:04,187
I don't know what to say.

273
00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:11,017
I mean, you know, obviously
we have this heat between us.

274
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:18,001
Obviously.

275
00:19:18,736 --> 00:19:21,330
But I love my husband.

276
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:23,871
And I know you love your wife.

277
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,805
I don't think we should get
this house now.

278
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:30,174
Don't say that. Don't dangle
the dream and take it away.

279
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:34,882
Chandler, one of us
has got to be strong.

280
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:37,320
I understand.

281
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:40,550
Although....

282
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:44,423
Maybe just one last moment
of weakness.

283
00:19:57,374 --> 00:20:00,434
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.

284
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:07,415
They're never coming down now!

285
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:11,979
- Hi.
- Hi!

286
00:20:12,156 --> 00:20:15,819
You are never going to believe
what happened to me today.

287
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:17,051
What?

288
00:20:17,228 --> 00:20:20,891
Ralph Lauren called, again,
and they offered me more money.

289
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:25,832
- They did?
- Yes! It was the weirdest thing.

290
00:20:26,003 --> 00:20:29,461
Zelner called me and said, "We will
do anything we can to get you back."

291
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,234
And that I should thank some "Ron."

292
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:35,572
I don't even know
what department that guy's in!

293
00:20:36,313 --> 00:20:39,441
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Well, I took it!

294
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:43,144
That's great!
So you're staying in New York!

295
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:52,126
- You're excited, right?
- You know-- Look, the money's great.

296
00:20:52,296 --> 00:20:55,527
- It's certainly the easier choice.
- Right.

297
00:20:55,699 --> 00:21:00,159
But, you know, I mean, was I looking
forward to going to Paris? Sure.

298
00:21:00,337 --> 00:21:04,273
Was I excited about working
in the fashion capital of the world?

299
00:21:04,441 --> 00:21:05,931
Oh, absolutely.

300
00:21:10,614 --> 00:21:13,014
Yeah, but you know, this is....

301
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:17,985
It's fine. I'm fine going back
to a job where I've pretty much...

302
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:21,591
...gotten everything out of it
that I possibly can.

303
00:21:25,362 --> 00:21:26,989
I had no idea--

304
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:34,164
I had no idea you were
so excited about Paris.

305
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:37,266
I mean, you said you were scared.

306
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:40,239
I mean, it was "good" scared, though,
you know?

307
00:21:40,411 --> 00:21:43,175
I mean, like "when I moved
to New York" scared.

308
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,249
Or "when I found out I was
gonna have Emma" scared.

309
00:21:50,888 --> 00:21:54,585
But this is fine.
This is gonna be good.

310
00:22:00,865 --> 00:22:02,662
You should go.

311
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:05,325
What?

312
00:22:07,204 --> 00:22:09,934
It's what you want. You should go.

313
00:22:10,774 --> 00:22:12,605
You really think so?

314
00:22:13,677 --> 00:22:15,542
I really do.

315
00:22:17,014 --> 00:22:20,142
But I already told Zelner
that I would come back.

316
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:22,911
I'm sure he'll understand.

317
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:33,527
All right. All right! I'm gonna do it!
I'm gonna go to Paris!

318
00:22:34,865 --> 00:22:36,264
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

319
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:38,799
I'm going to Paris!

320
00:22:38,969 --> 00:22:41,563
- Thank you, Ross.
- Yeah, yeah.

321
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,241
Oh, I'm so happy.

322
00:22:48,545 --> 00:22:50,570
Then I'm happy too.

323
00:23:00,925 --> 00:23:03,018
Thank you all for coming.

324
00:23:03,193 --> 00:23:07,027
We're here today to pay our respects
to a wonderful agent...

325
00:23:07,197 --> 00:23:09,256
...and a beautiful woman.

326
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:12,264
Inside.

327
00:23:14,705 --> 00:23:19,768
As Estelle's only two clients,
we would like to say a few words.

328
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:24,179
Dude, where's my speech?

329
00:23:28,686 --> 00:23:32,452
That is entertaining.
Al Zebooker, everybody!
