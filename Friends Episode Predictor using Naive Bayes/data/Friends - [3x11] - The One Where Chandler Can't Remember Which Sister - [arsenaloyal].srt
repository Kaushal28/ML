1
00:00:02,114 --> 00:00:04,810
Okay, pick a card. Any card.

2
00:00:04,983 --> 00:00:07,451
All right, now memorize it.

3
00:00:07,619 --> 00:00:09,917
Show it to everybody.

4
00:00:10,088 --> 00:00:11,077
Got it?

5
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:13,656
All right. Give it back to me.

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,963
Five of hearts.

7
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:23,491
Real magic does exist.

8
00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:26,900
-Joey, how do you do it?
-l can't tell you that.

9
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:33,601
Somebody's at the door on the ceiling.

10
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:36,608
That's our unbelievably loud
upstairs neighbor.

11
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:39,444
He took up the carpets,
and now you can hear everything.

12
00:00:39,618 --> 00:00:43,179
Why don't you go ask him to just,
''Step lightly, please?''

13
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:47,219
l have, like, five times.
But the guy is so charming...

14
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:50,884
...l go up there to yell,
then l end up apologizing to him.

15
00:00:51,063 --> 00:00:53,293
That is silly!

16
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:55,763
l'll go up there.
l'll tell him to keep it down.

17
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:57,834
-All right, be my guest.
-Good luck.

18
00:00:58,003 --> 00:00:59,163
All right, all right...

19
00:00:59,338 --> 00:01:02,364
...if you wanna know how l did it,
l'll show you.

20
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:05,668
When you handed me back the card,
what you didn't see was...

21
00:01:05,844 --> 00:01:10,178
...l looked at it so fast,
it was invisible to the naked eye.

22
00:01:11,316 --> 00:01:13,284
l just did it.

23
00:01:13,852 --> 00:01:15,979
Just did it again.

24
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:19,986
Here, l'll slow it down
so you guys can see it. Ready?

25
00:01:21,526 --> 00:01:23,960
-l got it now!
-Okay.

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,973
Thank you.

27
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:50,085
The One Where Chandler
Can't Remember Which Sister

28
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:36,828
Hi. Anybody got a length of rope
about six feet long...

29
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:38,936
...little noose at the end?

30
00:02:39,104 --> 00:02:42,267
-Honey, what's the matter?
-l just saw Janice.

31
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:47,777
She was at Rockefeller Center, skating
with her husband. She looked so happy.

32
00:02:47,946 --> 00:02:51,712
l almost feel bad for whipping
that kid's pretzel at them.

33
00:02:52,684 --> 00:02:55,847
l remember the first time l saw
Katherine after we broke up.

34
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:59,252
She was with her friend Donna.
Just laughing and talking.

35
00:02:59,424 --> 00:03:01,324
God, it killed me!

36
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:05,691
Yes, but you ended up having sex
with both of them that afternoon.

37
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:11,001
Sorry, l just-- Any excuse
to tell that story, you know?

38
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:14,802
Chandler, there's a party tomorrow.
You'll feel better then.

39
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:18,568
l'm gonna be okay. You don't
have to throw a party for me.

40
00:03:18,744 --> 00:03:21,212
lt's Joey's birthday.

41
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:25,040
Then if anybody should have a party,
it should be him.

42
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:31,220
l cannot believe
she's still up there.

43
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:42,464
Well, he totally screwed up
the punch line.

44
00:03:42,634 --> 00:03:44,932
You know, it's supposed to be--

45
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,744
-How's that coffee coming, dear?
-Right away, Mr. Kaplan.

46
00:03:55,914 --> 00:03:59,748
l'm not suppose to drink coffee.
lt makes me gassy.

47
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:02,143
l know.

48
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:05,857
l'll bet you're thinking,
''What's an intelligent girl...

49
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:10,017
...who wants to be in fashion
doing making coffee?''

50
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:12,060
You got me.

51
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,698
Don't think l haven't noticed
your potential.

52
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:19,030
l've got a project for you
that's a lot more related to fashion.

53
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:21,570
-How does that sound?
-That sounds great!

54
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:25,140
-Come on over here, sweetheart.
-Thank you so much.

55
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,508
l need these hangers separated
ASAP.

56
00:04:31,316 --> 00:04:33,181
You're welcome.

57
00:04:36,988 --> 00:04:41,186
-Oh, God, l hate my job! l hate it.
-l know, honey. l'm sorry.

58
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:44,851
l wanna quit, but then
l think l should stick it out.

59
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,156
Then l think:

60
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:49,596
''Why would such a person stay
in such a demeaning job...

61
00:04:49,768 --> 00:04:54,796
...just because it's remotely related
to the field they're interested in?''

62
00:04:55,874 --> 00:04:57,603
Gee, l don't know, Rach.

63
00:04:57,776 --> 00:05:02,270
Order up! Yentl soup, James Beans
and a Howdy, hold the Doody.

64
00:05:02,447 --> 00:05:06,349
Come on, l'm sorry. l didn't--
l don't mind paying my dues, you know?

65
00:05:06,518 --> 00:05:08,782
But how much will l learn
about fashion...

66
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:13,914
...by walking Myra, the arthritic
seamstress, to the bathroom?

67
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,386
Hi. ls my misery amusing to you?

68
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:21,391
l'm sorry, l was just....

69
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:23,693
lt's not funny.
This is actually my job.

70
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:25,564
No, believe me, l've been there.

71
00:05:25,737 --> 00:05:29,730
l had to sort mannequin heads
at that Mannequins Plus.

72
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:33,469
Well, then. l'm just gonna go back
to talking to my friend here.

73
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:36,170
You can go back to enjoying
your little hamburger.

74
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:39,545
Actually, that's
a Barbra Streisand-wich.

75
00:05:40,518 --> 00:05:43,146
What? l named that one.

76
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:47,055
-Just one other thing.
-Yes?

77
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:48,988
l work at Bloomingdale's.

78
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,290
l might know of a job possibility,
if you're interested.

79
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:57,463
Do you want my pickle?

80
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:06,041
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Gunther.

81
00:06:06,211 --> 00:06:08,839
You're going on a date
with the noisy guy upstairs?

82
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:12,643
-Well, he's very charming.
-l know. He's too charming!

83
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:16,150
But if you go out,
it'll be harder for me to hate him.

84
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:19,381
Well, you're just going
to have to try.

85
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:22,350
Joey? Where are the Jell-O shots?

86
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:24,825
l don't know.
Chandler's passing them--

87
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:27,728
Chandler!

88
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:29,867
Hello-dee-lo!

89
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:33,064
Well, somebody's feeling better.

90
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:37,199
-Stick out your tongue!
-Take off your shirt!

91
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:41,644
-Oh, my--!
-Oh, my God!

92
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:44,441
How many did you have?
These are pure vodka.

93
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:47,517
Yeah, Jell-O.
Just like Mom used to make.

94
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:52,323
The most unbelievable thing
happened today.

95
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,017
l'm having lunch at Monica's
and this guy starts talking to me.

96
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:58,525
He works for a buyer
at Bloomingdale's.

97
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:02,258
There's an opening there!
So l gave him my phone number.

98
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:05,731
He's gonna call me this weekend
to get me an interview!

99
00:07:05,904 --> 00:07:07,599
l know!

100
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:11,640
What, so this guy's helping you
for no apparent reason?

101
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:18,545
-And he's a total stranger?
-Yeah. His name is Mark something.

102
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,719
Sounds like Mark Something
wants to have some sex!

103
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:25,116
What?

104
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:29,954
l'm just saying. Why else would he
swoop in out of nowhere for no reason?

105
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:31,254
To be nice.

106
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:35,456
Hey, Joey, are men ever nice
to strange women for no reason?

107
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:38,101
-No, only for sex.
-Thank you.

108
00:07:39,738 --> 00:07:43,299
So did you tell
Mark Something about me?

109
00:07:44,142 --> 00:07:45,131
l didn't have to.

110
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,304
l was wearing my ''l Heart Ross''
sandwich board and ringing my bell.

111
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,942
Joey!
Happy birthday!

112
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:01,985
How many of that girl are you seeing?

113
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:07,494
How hammered are you?
These are Joey's sisters.

114
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:09,656
Hi, Joey's sisters!

115
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:12,428
What are we drinking over here?

116
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:15,797
Well, l have a vodka
and cranberry juice.

117
00:08:15,974 --> 00:08:17,066
No kidding?

118
00:08:17,242 --> 00:08:22,202
That's the same drink l made myself
right after l shot my husband.

119
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:26,773
Okay, l don't know how
to talk to you.

120
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:29,851
What you doing?

121
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:34,391
l'm taking my ex-girlfriend
off my speed dialer.

122
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,584
No, it's a good thing.

123
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:40,219
Why must we dial so speedily, anyway?
Why rush through life?

124
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:42,593
Why can't we savor
the precious moments?

125
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:45,736
Those are some huge breasts you have!

126
00:08:46,805 --> 00:08:49,069
-Hi.
-Hi.

127
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,404
So l heard about this Mark guy
that Rachel met today.

128
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:56,172
-lsn't it great?
-Oh, yeah!

129
00:08:56,347 --> 00:08:59,646
So yeah, pretty good--
He sounds like a nice, good guy.

130
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:02,719
Oh, he is.
And he is so dreamy!

131
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:05,788
l mean, when he left,
l actually used the phrase:

132
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:07,891
''Hummina, hummina, hummina.''

133
00:09:09,894 --> 00:09:11,919
That's excellent.

134
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,801
So he's ''just a nice guy.''

135
00:09:18,236 --> 00:09:22,229
Do you really think this Mark
doesn't want anything for helping you?

136
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:25,535
Well, l assume l'll have
to take showers with him.

137
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,406
But, you know, that's true of any job.

138
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,678
How you feeling?

139
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:38,482
Well, my apartment isn't
there anymore because l drank it.

140
00:09:40,258 --> 00:09:44,024
Where'd you go? We lost you
after you opened up all the presents.

141
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:48,522
l ended up in the storage room,
and not alone.

142
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:53,833
No ''woo-hooing.'' No ''woo-hooing.''

143
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:57,066
Why, what happened?

144
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:01,944
l fooled around with Joey's sister.

145
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,816
-That's not the worst part.
-What is the worst part?

146
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:08,043
l can't remember which sister.

147
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,016
You see what men do?
Don't tell me men are nice.

148
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,817
This is men!

149
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,657
Are you insane?

150
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:19,661
Joey will kill you.
He'll actually kill you dead.

151
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:22,698
You don't think l thought of that?

152
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:26,166
-How can you not know which one?
-That's unbelievable.

153
00:10:26,337 --> 00:10:27,998
-Was it Gina?
-Which one's Gina?

154
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:30,403
The dark, big hair,
with airplane earrings.

155
00:10:30,642 --> 00:10:32,337
No, that's not Gina. That's Dina.

156
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,809
You see? You can't tell
which is which either!

157
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:40,518
We didn't fool around
with any of them.

158
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:47,018
lt's gotta be Veronica.
The girl in the red skirt.

159
00:10:47,192 --> 00:10:50,286
l definitely stuck my tongue
down her throat!

160
00:10:50,762 --> 00:10:52,696
That was me.

161
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,530
When l drink, sometimes
l get overly friendly and l'm sorry.

162
00:10:59,704 --> 00:11:01,103
-That's okay.
-That's all right.

163
00:11:01,272 --> 00:11:03,001
That's okay.

164
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:08,738
Can l talk to you for a second?

165
00:11:10,181 --> 00:11:12,376
Hey, Joey!

166
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:15,585
Come on.

167
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:18,188
Why can't we talk in here...

168
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:20,290
...with witnesses?

169
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:22,789
l just got off the phone
with my sister.

170
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:24,588
-Which one?
-Mary Angela.

171
00:11:24,762 --> 00:11:26,252
-Mary Angela.
-Yeah.

172
00:11:26,664 --> 00:11:28,655
Now which one is she again?

173
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,927
Why don't you ask Chandler?
He fooled around with her.

174
00:11:32,103 --> 00:11:35,197
She told me you said
you could really fall for her.

175
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:40,106
ls that true, or are you just getting
over Janice by groping my sister?

176
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:44,543
lt's gotta be the first one.

177
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,612
Really?

178
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:48,945
That's great!

179
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:52,686
You and my sister, sitting in a tree!

180
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:55,819
Yep, l'm in a tree.

181
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,291
Did he call? Did Mark call?

182
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:04,228
No, honey, l'm sorry.
But the weekend's not over yet.

183
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:09,238
Oh, my God! ls that Phoebe?

184
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:11,637
Guess they're back from their date.

185
00:12:13,378 --> 00:12:15,710
Music!

186
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,905
Very nice!

187
00:12:25,857 --> 00:12:27,017
Oh, my God!

188
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:34,395
-So how are you?
-l am good. l finished my book.

189
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:36,760
-What's it about?
-l don't remember.

190
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:39,767
-Do you wanna take a walk?
-Yeah, l do.

191
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,235
''Dear Mary Angela:

192
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:46,036
Hi, how's it going?

193
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,678
This is the hardest letter
l've ever had to write.''

194
00:12:48,846 --> 00:12:51,371
What the hell's the matter with you?

195
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:55,212
How will Joey react to you
blowing off his sister with a letter?

196
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:58,753
That's the part where you tell him
that l moved to France...

197
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:01,617
...when actually l'll be in Cuba.

198
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:06,628
Look, you've got to do this yourself.
ln person. At least you know her name.

199
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:09,426
You just go to the house
and ask for Mary Angela.

200
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,727
When whichever one she is
comes to the door...

201
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:15,134
...you take her for a walk,
you let her down easy.

202
00:13:15,306 --> 00:13:19,367
What if Mary Angela comes to the door
and l ask for Mary Angela?

203
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,942
Where in Cuba?

204
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:36,257
Joey! What are you doing here?

205
00:13:36,427 --> 00:13:38,793
Waiting for my grandma
to finish my laundry.

206
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:42,922
-What about you?
-l'm here to see Mary Angela.

207
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:46,797
You are so the man! Come on.

208
00:13:47,605 --> 00:13:50,039
Now look, listen.
Listen....

209
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,302
Be cool, because Grandma
doesn't know about you two.

210
00:13:53,478 --> 00:13:55,469
And you do not wanna tick her off.

211
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:59,810
She was, like, the sixth person
to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.

212
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:05,078
-Where are your parents?
-They're in Vermont, buying cigarettes.

213
00:14:05,256 --> 00:14:07,190
Where's Mary Angela?

214
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:09,792
-She's right in there.
-Okay.

215
00:14:11,262 --> 00:14:13,958
-Hey, Chandler!
-Hey, Chandler!

216
00:14:17,568 --> 00:14:19,798
l can't believe Mark didn't call.

217
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:23,734
-lt's Sunday night and he didn't call.
-Bummer.

218
00:14:24,142 --> 00:14:27,407
Yeah, right. Look at you.
You're practically giddy.

219
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:30,308
l'm genuinely sorry
the Mark thing didn't work out.

220
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:34,577
Look, Rach, l want
only good things for you.

221
00:14:34,752 --> 00:14:38,381
Wait a minute.
Why don't you just call Mark?

222
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,954
Who says you have to sit
and wait for him?

223
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:43,855
You've got to make stuff happen!

224
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:47,623
Yeah, but you don't
wanna seem too pushy.

225
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,666
lt's not pushy.
He gave her his home number.

226
00:14:50,835 --> 00:14:53,895
He gave you his home number,
as in, to his home?

227
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:58,074
And you don't mind if l call,
because you want good things for me.

228
00:14:58,242 --> 00:15:02,338
That's right, good things.
That is what l said.

229
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:09,185
Hello. Mark?
Hi, it's Rachel Greene.

230
00:15:11,789 --> 00:15:15,225
Oh, no.
Don't you apologize.

231
00:15:15,393 --> 00:15:16,553
Yeah, l'll hold.

232
00:15:17,094 --> 00:15:19,358
He left my number at work
and was gonna get it...

233
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:23,125
...but he had to help his niece
with her report on the pioneers.

234
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:25,861
That is so made up!

235
00:15:26,604 --> 00:15:28,265
Oh, my God! Tomorrow?

236
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:30,202
That's-- No, it's perfect.

237
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:32,638
Oh, God! Thank you so much!

238
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,277
Great. Bye.

239
00:15:34,712 --> 00:15:37,772
-l got the interview!
-There you go!

240
00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:41,077
He even offered to meet me for lunch
and prep me for it.

241
00:15:41,252 --> 00:15:42,310
That is amazing!

242
00:15:42,487 --> 00:15:46,548
Well, if l know Mark,
and l think l do...

243
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:48,850
...l'd expect nothing less.

244
00:15:49,026 --> 00:15:50,584
l gotta figure out what to wear.

245
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:54,629
High collar and baggy pants say,
''l'm a pro!''

246
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:58,493
Yeah, right.
Okay, l'll see you guys later.

247
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:00,830
You go get them!

248
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:04,099
What did l do to you?
Did l hurt you in some way?

249
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:08,273
-What?
-''Why don't you call him?''

250
00:16:08,446 --> 00:16:11,904
Well, thank you very much.
Now he's gonna prep her...

251
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:16,110
...as in what you do before
you surgically remove the boyfriend!

252
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:17,510
Are you crazy?

253
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:22,284
Am l? Am l out of my mind?
Am l losing my senses?

254
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,418
This dreamy guy's taking my girlfriend
out for a meal!

255
00:16:26,664 --> 00:16:28,427
This isn't even about you!

256
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:31,261
lt's about something wonderful
happening for Rachel.

257
00:16:31,702 --> 00:16:34,500
Even if you're right,
and he wants to sleep with her...

258
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:36,639
...does that mean he gets to?

259
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:38,775
-No, but--
-Don't you trust her?

260
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:42,872
Then get over yourself!
Grow up!

261
00:16:47,118 --> 00:16:49,177
You grow up.

262
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:05,496
This tiramisu is excellent.
Did you make it, Mary Angela?

263
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,069
No, l did.

264
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:09,967
Well, it's yummy.

265
00:17:11,075 --> 00:17:14,772
So.... Mary Angela, do you like it?

266
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:17,244
Of course. lt's her favorite.

267
00:17:19,684 --> 00:17:24,280
So.... Mary Angela,
what's your second favorite?

268
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:26,013
More of Grandma's tiramisu.

269
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,125
Oh, would you just please...

270
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:34,430
...give me your recipe,
because this is great! lt's topnotch!

271
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,793
That dies with me.

272
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,832
So will l.

273
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:41,769
Excuse yourself
and go to the bathroom.

274
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:44,373
l was just squinting.
lt doesn't mean anything.

275
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,100
Just do it!

276
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:54,378
Will you excuse me, l have to....

277
00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:11,064
Finally! l thought we'd never be alone.
Can l just tell you something?

278
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:15,001
l have not stopped thinking
about you since the party.

279
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:19,907
Look, l may have jumped the gun here.

280
00:18:21,879 --> 00:18:23,710
l just got out of a relationship...

281
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:27,783
...and l'm not really
in a in a commitment kind of place.

282
00:18:27,952 --> 00:18:29,044
So? Me neither!

283
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,850
God, Mary Angela was right.
You do have the softest lips.

284
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:35,982
You're not Mary Angela?

285
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,287
No! l'm Mary Therese!

286
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:40,763
This is so bad.

287
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:43,729
lf you're not Mary Angela,
then who is?

288
00:18:43,901 --> 00:18:45,698
l am.

289
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:48,764
Oh, it's so bad.

290
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:52,804
-Joey!
-No Joey! No Joey! No Joey!

291
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:55,343
-Joey.
-What's going on?

292
00:18:56,147 --> 00:18:58,240
You're it! Now run and hide!

293
00:18:59,383 --> 00:19:01,977
lt's no big deal.
Chandler was just kissing me...

294
00:19:02,153 --> 00:19:04,383
...because he thought
l was Mary Angela.

295
00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:07,524
What? How could you think
she was Mary Angela?

296
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:10,752
l wasn't sure which one
Mary Angela was.

297
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,864
Look, l'm sorry. l was really drunk
and you guys all look really similar.

298
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:19,832
-l say punch him, Joey!
-Yeah, punch him!

299
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:21,972
We should all calm down...

300
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:24,699
...because your brother's
not gonna punch me.

301
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,367
-Are you?
-That is usually what l would do.

302
00:19:28,546 --> 00:19:31,413
But l never thought you'd be
on the receiving end of it.

303
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:32,913
How could you do this?

304
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:35,052
Hey, where'd everybody go?

305
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:38,052
Why don't you go into the den?
l think Cops is on.

306
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:45,894
lf you wanna punch me, go ahead.
l deserve it.

307
00:19:46,063 --> 00:19:50,466
But l want you to know that l'd never
soberly hurt you or your family.

308
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:52,534
You're my best friend.

309
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,764
And l would never do anything
like this, ever again.

310
00:19:57,241 --> 00:19:59,903
So what? l say punch him!

311
00:20:00,077 --> 00:20:01,510
Yeah, punch him!

312
00:20:02,513 --> 00:20:05,311
No, l'm not gonna punch Chandler.

313
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:07,808
-l'll do it.
-No, you won't!

314
00:20:08,185 --> 00:20:12,144
He knows he did a terrible thing,
and l believe him. He's sorry.

315
00:20:12,323 --> 00:20:16,726
But you got one more apology to make.
You gotta apologize to Mary Angela.

316
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:20,227
-Okay. Absolutely. You got it.
-All right.

317
00:20:29,473 --> 00:20:31,464
-Cookie, now you can punch him!
-What?

318
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:41,885
Hey! What are you doing here?

319
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:45,179
You know, this building's
on my paper route, so....

320
00:20:47,124 --> 00:20:48,557
How did it go?

321
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:51,388
The woman l interviewed with
was pretty tough...

322
00:20:51,562 --> 00:20:53,325
...but thank God Mark coached me.

323
00:20:53,497 --> 00:20:56,432
Once l talked about the Fall line,
she got all happy.

324
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,626
-l'm so proud of you.
-Me too!

325
00:21:00,237 --> 00:21:01,534
Listen, l'm....

326
00:21:02,673 --> 00:21:07,133
l'm sorry l've been so crazy
and jealous and....

327
00:21:07,311 --> 00:21:09,575
lt's just, l like you a lot, so....

328
00:21:09,747 --> 00:21:11,874
-l know.
-Yeah?

329
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:14,074
-Rachel. Hi.
-Hi, Mark.

330
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:18,816
l just talked to Joanna,
and she loves you. You got the job.

331
00:21:18,989 --> 00:21:20,889
-l did?
-Yes!

332
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:22,184
Oh, my God!

333
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:24,927
Congratulations....

334
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:32,261
So, Phoebe, how was your date?

335
00:21:32,436 --> 00:21:34,461
Oh, well, you know....

336
00:21:34,638 --> 00:21:37,129
Yeah, l do know.

337
00:21:37,308 --> 00:21:38,707
You were eavesdropping?

338
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:42,812
Eavesdropping? Pheebs,
the ceiling tiles were falling down.

339
00:21:44,615 --> 00:21:46,014
Oh, l'm sorry.

340
00:21:46,183 --> 00:21:48,014
But l really like this guy...

341
00:21:48,185 --> 00:21:51,484
...and l think he really
happens to likes me.

342
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,988
Maybe he's just...

343
00:21:58,162 --> 00:22:01,325
...jumping on a pogo stick
and he really likes it.

344
00:22:05,002 --> 00:22:07,095
Maybe the pogo stick likes it too.

345
00:22:08,906 --> 00:22:11,807
All right, that's it.
He cannot do this to Phoebe!

346
00:22:11,976 --> 00:22:15,207
This guy's gonna get
the butt-kicking of a lifetime!

347
00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:17,574
But is he a big guy?

348
00:22:17,748 --> 00:22:19,045
We'll all go. Come on.

349
00:22:19,216 --> 00:22:22,481
Well, let's see,
l just got beat up by a girl....

350
00:22:22,653 --> 00:22:24,348
They need me.

351
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:27,887
-Thanks, you guys. Thank you!
-Don't worry!

352
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:31,585
God!
l hope they kick his ass!

353
00:22:31,762 --> 00:22:33,195
Honey, l'm sorry.

354
00:22:33,364 --> 00:22:34,888
lf it's any consolation...

355
00:22:35,065 --> 00:22:38,831
...he really did sound like
he was having more fun with you.

356
00:22:57,021 --> 00:22:58,010
