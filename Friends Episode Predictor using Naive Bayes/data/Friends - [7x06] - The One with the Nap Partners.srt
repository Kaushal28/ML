1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,689
The reason I asked you to brunch...

2
00:00:03,905 --> 00:00:07,060
...is because I've been thinking
about my maid of honor.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,295
Oh, my God. This is it. Oh.

4
00:00:10,237 --> 00:00:11,340
I hope it's you.

5
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,468
- I hope it's you.
- Me too.

6
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:17,430
First of all,
I love you both so much.

7
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:21,359
- You're both so important to me.
- Blah, blah, blah. Who is it?

8
00:00:22,728 --> 00:00:25,301
I was thinking we could
come up with a system...

9
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:27,692
...where we trade off
being maid of honor.

10
00:00:27,947 --> 00:00:31,173
- Hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
- Yes! Oh.

11
00:00:33,026 --> 00:00:34,271
Hypothetically.

12
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:35,624
Still.

13
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:41,059
If Phoebe were mine, Rachel would
be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's.

14
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:43,845
We all get to do it
and no one gets upset.

15
00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:48,333
- That's a pretty good idea.
- I'll do that. So, who's yours?

16
00:00:49,587 --> 00:00:53,193
Well, that's the best part.
You guys get to decide.

17
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:58,418
- Why is that the best part?
- I don't have to.

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,855
Of course we'll help you decide.
We'll do anything we can to help you.

19
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:06,598
I'd like to make a toast.

20
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:09,936
To the future Mrs. Chandler Bing...

21
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:14,878
...my best friend and truly one
of the nicest people that...

22
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,957
- Really not deciding.
- Fine.

23
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,481
Excuse me,
I couldn't help overhearing.

24
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:24,130
- You're marrying Chandler Bing?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,708
Good luck!

26
00:01:28,414 --> 00:01:30,846
Oh, and good luck to you too!

27
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:33,280
What a nice lady.

28
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:39,083
The One With Nap Partners

29
00:02:13,957 --> 00:02:16,353
Yeah!

30
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:20,003
- Die Hard, still great.
- Yep.

31
00:02:20,254 --> 00:02:22,021
Let's make it a double feature?

32
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:23,481
What else you rent?

33
00:02:24,116 --> 00:02:26,060
Die Hard 2.

34
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:28,982
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.

35
00:02:30,413 --> 00:02:34,446
Well, we'll watch it a second time
and it's Die Hard 2.

36
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:38,264
- Joey, we just saw it.
- And?

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,501
It would be cool to see it again!

38
00:02:40,816 --> 00:02:43,556
- Yeah! Die Hard!
- Die Hard!

39
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:47,250
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard.

40
00:02:48,226 --> 00:02:49,756
Is everything okay?

41
00:02:50,418 --> 00:02:52,671
Yeah, I just got plans.

42
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:56,252
Well, John McClane had plans.

43
00:02:57,203 --> 00:03:00,228
I want to leave before
Joey gets all worked up...

44
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:02,762
...and starts calling
everybody "bitch."

45
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:06,898
What are you talking about, bitch?

46
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:11,465
- Hey, Rachel.
- Yeah?

47
00:03:11,746 --> 00:03:15,256
When I get married,
will you be my maid of honor?

48
00:03:15,503 --> 00:03:16,890
Really?

49
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:20,406
Oh, my God, Phoebe.
I mean, I'm just...

50
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:22,075
Wait a minute.

51
00:03:25,106 --> 00:03:29,068
If I'm your maid of honor,
that means that you are Monica's.

52
00:03:29,315 --> 00:03:30,631
Oh.

53
00:03:32,238 --> 00:03:34,183
Well, if that's what you want.

54
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:38,047
No way, Phoebe.
I want to be Monica's.

55
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:41,588
- Why does it even matter?
- Why does it matter to you?

56
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,023
Because this one is now.

57
00:03:44,693 --> 00:03:47,054
And it's two of our best friends.

58
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:49,769
And who knows what you're gonna marry.

59
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:54,983
What if I marry Ross? Or Joey?

60
00:03:56,418 --> 00:03:57,842
You wouldn't.

61
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:03,826
Okay, look, Rachel.
I know you really want to do this...

62
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:07,369
...but I've never been
maid of honor to anyone before.

63
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:09,708
I know you've done it at least twice.

64
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:12,798
- Yeah, but Phoebe...
- Please let me finish.

65
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:16,133
I guess that was it.

66
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:19,267
Okay.

67
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,688
Since you've never done it before,
you can be Monica's maid of honor.

68
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:25,920
Oh, thank you so much!

69
00:04:27,661 --> 00:04:28,835
Yay.

70
00:04:31,592 --> 00:04:33,644
I'm gonna marry someone good.

71
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:35,593
Oh, I know.

72
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:37,401
Better than Chandler.

73
00:04:58,104 --> 00:05:00,156
- What happened?
- I don't know.

74
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:08,603
We fell asleep. That is all.

75
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,320
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.

76
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:15,007
All right, well, I'd better go.

77
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:17,201
- I think that would be best.
- Yeah.

78
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:19,073
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

79
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:22,731
- But not about this.
- No, never. Never!

80
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,502
- Bye.
- No touch. No touch.

81
00:05:32,234 --> 00:05:35,116
Die Hard!

82
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,175
Opening a topless carwash
was a great idea.

83
00:05:42,394 --> 00:05:45,205
We'll definitely have enough money
to open our bikini shop.

84
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:53,137
Now we mince the shallots like this.

85
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:57,136
Look, honey, the nice people
are chopping shallots.

86
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:01,524
Maybe if they chop enough of them,
they can open that bikini shot.

87
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:05,247
Hey, a weird thing happened at brunch.

88
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,998
This woman overheard that
I was marrying you...

89
00:06:08,278 --> 00:06:10,081
...and she wished me good luck.

90
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,512
That's sweet.

91
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:14,674
No, it was more like a "good luck."

92
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:20,903
Well, do you think she meant,
"Good luck taming that wild stallion."

93
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:25,457
Not judging you, a little gay.

94
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:27,820
So, what did this woman look like?

95
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,433
She was, like, 30,
dark hair, attractive.

96
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,062
Any chance you were looking into a
bright, shiny thing called a mirror?

97
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:37,875
Was it someone you dated in college?

98
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,348
No, I only dated two girls
in college...

99
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:43,968
...both blond, both not attractive.

100
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:46,547
Let me check this out.

101
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:49,391
- What are you doing?
- Well, let's see.

102
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:52,457
Okay, is that her?

103
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,024
Oh, my God, yes!

104
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:57,949
- Who is she?
- Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend.

105
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,807
Did you break up with her?

106
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:03,596
No, we're still together.

107
00:07:07,842 --> 00:07:11,140
We went out for two summers
and then I broke up with her.

108
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,502
- Why?
- She came back the third summer...

109
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:17,305
...and she'd gotten really fa...

110
00:07:20,193 --> 00:07:22,790
- Fat?
- I did not say fat.

111
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:25,689
I said fa...

112
00:07:26,838 --> 00:07:29,756
You broke up with a girl
because she was fat?

113
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:31,737
Yeah. Yeah.

114
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:36,327
But it was a really long time ago.
Does she still feel bad?

115
00:07:36,546 --> 00:07:37,862
Apparently she does.

116
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:40,993
You know what they say:
"Elephants never forget."

117
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:47,674
Seriously, good luck marrying me.

118
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,670
Rach, wanna come with me Friday night?
I'm gonna check out some male strippers.

119
00:07:55,855 --> 00:07:57,728
For the bachelorette party?

120
00:07:58,569 --> 00:07:59,992
Yes.

121
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,292
Hey, what's going on?

122
00:08:03,578 --> 00:08:05,522
She's Monica's maid of honor.

123
00:08:05,771 --> 00:08:10,112
Hope it goes better than the last time
you did it for that girl downstairs.

124
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,989
You have been maid of honor before?

125
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:18,982
You see? This is exactly why
you shouldn't lie.

126
00:08:19,895 --> 00:08:21,876
That's it. I am maid of honor.

127
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:24,173
- No, I am.
- How come you are?

128
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:27,086
Because I cared enough to lie.

129
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,077
Hey, I could help you decide
who should do it.

130
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:31,791
We could have an audition.

131
00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:35,098
See how you'd handle
maid-of-honor-type situations.

132
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:37,525
- What do you mean?
- When I want a job...

133
00:08:37,813 --> 00:08:40,968
...I audition and if I'm the best
of the people they see...

134
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:42,017
...I get the part.

135
00:08:42,475 --> 00:08:45,013
Then they send you a script.
You go to the set.

136
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,204
You rehearse and you
have wardrobe fittings.

137
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:49,360
Then you shoot your part.
And it's great.

138
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:52,527
But right after that, you're back out
on the street looking for work again.

139
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:55,171
Right back where you started.

140
00:08:55,383 --> 00:09:00,175
So I gotta say, I don't think a career in
acting is the right choice for you two.

141
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,082
Joey, the maid of honor thing.

142
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:11,976
Right.

143
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:16,078
So, okay, so after this audition,
who decides who gets it?

144
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:18,545
Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.

145
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:21,641
- It's better than us deciding.
- Oh, this is crazy.

146
00:09:21,964 --> 00:09:25,511
- Can't we just flip a coin?
- No, coins hate me.

147
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:30,306
Okay, fine. You know what?
We will let Ross and Joey decide.

148
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:32,462
Hi!

149
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:34,896
Ross, sweetie.

150
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:40,015
Hey there, handsome thing.

151
00:09:43,605 --> 00:09:48,018
Wow, this cologne really is
every bit as good as Giorgio.

152
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:55,528
Hey.

153
00:09:55,851 --> 00:09:58,841
Just brought back your videos.

154
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:02,977
Hey, Ross. Look, I think
we need to talk about before.

155
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,171
No. No, we don't.

156
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:06,563
Yes, we do.

157
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:10,279
Now, look.
That was the best nap I ever had.

158
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:17,795
I don't know what
you're talking about.

159
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,026
Come on, admit it.

160
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:22,327
That was the best nap you ever had.

161
00:10:23,546 --> 00:10:25,099
I've had better.

162
00:10:26,954 --> 00:10:28,722
Okay. When?

163
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:33,387
All right! All right!
It was the best nap ever!

164
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:35,090
I said it, okay?

165
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,285
But it's over, Joey!

166
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:40,869
I want to do it again.

167
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,886
We can't do it again.

168
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,531
- Why not?
- Because it's weird!

169
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,416
Fine.

170
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:54,821
You want a drink?

171
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:58,577
- Sure. What do you got?
- Warm milk and Excedrin PM.

172
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:07,310
Chandler.

173
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:10,470
I just figured out who you are.

174
00:11:10,758 --> 00:11:12,940
Can you figure out what I'm doing?

175
00:11:14,411 --> 00:11:16,985
- You're Louis Posen.
- Who?

176
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:20,392
He was my best friend in fifth grade.

177
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,972
One day, I asked him to be
my boyfriend and he said no.

178
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:25,395
Do you know why?

179
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:29,917
Because you kept talking to him while
he was trying to go to the bathroom?

180
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,641
No, but because he thought
I was too fa...

181
00:11:35,842 --> 00:11:39,140
Every time I think about it,
I feel as bad as I did then.

182
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,965
I really think you should
apologize to Julie.

183
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:45,305
Honey, are you kidding?
That was like 16 years ago.

184
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:49,263
It would make me feel better
if Louis apologized to me.

185
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,026
I'll do it. But I warn you,
this may make me a better person.

186
00:11:53,273 --> 00:11:55,942
And that is not the man
you fell in love with.

187
00:11:58,422 --> 00:11:59,845
- I can live with that.
- Okay.

188
00:12:00,092 --> 00:12:03,497
- So how do we find her.
- She probably lives in the city.

189
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:06,522
- She was eating in that restaurant.
- I'll bet she was.

190
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:12,467
What is wrong with me?

191
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:18,456
Okay, we'll give you hypothetical
maid-of-honor situations.

192
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:21,102
You'll be scored
on a scale of one to ten.

193
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,712
- One being the highest.
- Ten is the highest.

194
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,186
- Why is 10 the highest?
- Because it's the highest.

195
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,372
Okay, Rachel, you're up first.

196
00:12:32,657 --> 00:12:35,290
Situation number one:
You're with Monica.

197
00:12:35,614 --> 00:12:39,742
The wedding is about to start
when Monica gets cold feet. Go!

198
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:42,216
I don't want to marry Chandler.

199
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:44,650
- I've got cold feet.
- It's gonna be okay.

200
00:12:44,904 --> 00:12:47,335
One man the rest of my life?
I don't know.

201
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,050
This means I'll never
get to sleep with Joey.

202
00:12:52,558 --> 00:12:54,575
Look, Monica...

203
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,906
...getting cold feet is very common.

204
00:12:57,186 --> 00:12:59,511
It's just because
of all the anticipation.

205
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,828
And you just have to remember
that you love Chandler.

206
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:06,612
And also, I ran out on a wedding.

207
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:09,323
You don't get to keep the gifts.

208
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:12,412
Drawing on your own experience.

209
00:13:12,702 --> 00:13:13,876
Very good.

210
00:13:14,164 --> 00:13:16,453
Yes, very nice, Rachel.

211
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:17,877
Thank you, judges.

212
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,182
- Kiss ass.
- Oh.

213
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:24,389
- Okay, Phoebe.
- Yes, Your Honor.

214
00:13:25,436 --> 00:13:27,168
We're now in the ceremony.

215
00:13:27,385 --> 00:13:29,366
Monica is about to say, "I do"...

216
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:32,005
...when her drunk uncle
starts yelling.

217
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,536
What do you do? Go!

218
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,394
When Monica was a little girl...

219
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,478
...I remember that...

220
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:42,829
Ow!

221
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:44,499
- Very good!
- Oh.

222
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:47,105
Yes, excellent. Perfect score.

223
00:13:47,424 --> 00:13:50,758
She just made a scene
in the middle of the ceremony!

224
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:53,747
Hey, you want
a little taste of Pheebs?

225
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,608
Ladies, please. Please.

226
00:13:56,818 --> 00:13:59,973
Okay, the next situation is for Rachel.

227
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,175
The wedding is about to start.

228
00:14:02,385 --> 00:14:06,976
You walk into the back room and you
find Monica taking a nap with Ross.

229
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,751
I'll be Monica. Go!

230
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:10,514
No, no, no!

231
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:15,605
This situation is not sanctioned!

232
00:14:17,972 --> 00:14:20,439
Now, we're moving on to the next one.

233
00:14:20,686 --> 00:14:22,275
Okay.

234
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:28,755
It is time for you to give
your maid-of-honor speech.

235
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,495
We haven't even prepared...

236
00:14:30,741 --> 00:14:33,029
- Go!
- Okay, okay, okay.

237
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:36,684
Webster's Dictionary
defines marriage as...

238
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:41,416
Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks!
Okay, never mind. Forget it.

239
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:46,565
I met... I met Monica when we were
just a couple of 6-year-olds...

240
00:14:46,848 --> 00:14:51,712
...and became friends with Chandler
when he was 25...

241
00:14:51,998 --> 00:14:54,287
...although he seemed
like a 6-year-old.

242
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,520
Oh.

243
00:14:57,321 --> 00:14:59,504
Thank you. Thank you very much.

244
00:15:01,496 --> 00:15:04,166
I've known them
separately and together.

245
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:09,529
To know them as a couple is to know
that you are in the presence of love.

246
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:13,036
So I would like to raise my glass...

247
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,949
...to Monica and Chandler...

248
00:15:15,204 --> 00:15:19,652
...and the beautiful adventure they
are about to embark upon together.

249
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:23,516
I can think of no two people
better prepared for the journey.

250
00:15:24,563 --> 00:15:25,986
Wow.

251
00:15:27,346 --> 00:15:29,529
- Great speech.
- Yeah, it really was.

252
00:15:29,782 --> 00:15:30,813
Oh, thanks.

253
00:15:31,104 --> 00:15:36,004
Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next.
Although I really don't see the point.

254
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:40,626
Okay.

255
00:15:42,864 --> 00:15:46,268
I can't believe that Monica
and Chandler are getting married.

256
00:15:46,552 --> 00:15:49,054
I remember talking
about this day with Rachel...

257
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,076
...while we were
showering together, naked.

258
00:15:59,738 --> 00:16:01,683
And she's back in the game!

259
00:16:11,566 --> 00:16:12,538
Julie. Hi.

260
00:16:12,784 --> 00:16:15,038
Chandler Bing.
I guess you remember me.

261
00:16:15,394 --> 00:16:17,339
Hello, Skidmark.

262
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:22,552
It's a nickname. I'll explain later.

263
00:16:23,118 --> 00:16:24,612
It's pretty clear.

264
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:30,909
I owe you a long, overdue apology.

265
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:34,594
I shouldn't have broken up with you
because of your weight.

266
00:16:35,504 --> 00:16:37,342
That's why you broke up with me?

267
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:42,805
You didn't know that?

268
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:47,081
Well, I guess my work here is done.

269
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:54,218
Can I get you guys something to drink
while you tabulate?

270
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,097
Actually, the final
vote has been tallied.

271
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:00,378
- I'll take a cocoa.
- Too late.

272
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:05,832
But first of all, I would like to say
you both performed very well, okay?

273
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,579
You should be proud.

274
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:12,616
And I'd also like to say, in this
competition, there are no losers.

275
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:15,158
Well, except Rachel. Damn it!

276
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,355
Really? I won.

277
00:17:18,645 --> 00:17:21,527
- What?
- I'm sorry, Rach, it was really close.

278
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:25,525
- Well, then I demand a recount!
- Actually, it wasn't that close.

279
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:28,803
You know what?
Your thing was so stupid anyway.

280
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,266
We're gonna flip a coin, all right?

281
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:33,040
Heads.

282
00:17:35,136 --> 00:17:37,639
What? The coins have
finally forgiven me!

283
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:42,437
Know what? I hope Monica
forgives you after you throw her...

284
00:17:42,755 --> 00:17:47,761
...vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y
shower.

285
00:17:48,427 --> 00:17:52,804
Rach, it's gonna be okay.
You guys are the best!

286
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:58,819
Boy, I tell you. That judging stuff
took a lot out of me.

287
00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:00,176
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

288
00:18:00,465 --> 00:18:04,664
Thinking about maybe going upstairs
and taking a little nap on my couch.

289
00:18:07,945 --> 00:18:10,341
Why would I care about that?

290
00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:14,691
No reason. I'm just saying that...

291
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:17,197
...that's where I'll be.

292
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:40,848
As bad as that went,
I actually enjoyed myself.

293
00:18:41,137 --> 00:18:45,443
I think that I'm going to apologize
for all the stupid things that I do.

294
00:18:45,694 --> 00:18:48,161
Why don't you just stop
doing stupid things?

295
00:18:48,512 --> 00:18:52,509
- Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
- I'd love it if I could do both.

296
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:58,460
All right, I have to ask.

297
00:18:58,985 --> 00:18:59,993
What?

298
00:19:01,315 --> 00:19:03,568
Will you break up with me
if I get fat?

299
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:04,924
What?

300
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,475
You broke up with Julie.
How much weight did she gain?

301
00:19:08,726 --> 00:19:10,979
A hundred and forty-five pounds.

302
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,693
In one year?

303
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:16,160
My God, what did she eat?
Her family?

304
00:19:18,746 --> 00:19:20,335
That's not the point.

305
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:24,480
I know it was a stupid reason to
break up with someone, but I was 15.

306
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,929
Yeah, well, that's not
the only time this was an issue.

307
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:33,425
You remember when you spent
Thanksgiving with us?

308
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:34,703
You called me fat.

309
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:36,132
Wait a minute.

310
00:19:36,386 --> 00:19:38,924
- That was totally different.
- How?

311
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:42,988
You were not supposed to hear that.
I said that behind your back.

312
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:47,753
What if I have babies, okay?
I'm gonna look different.

313
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:50,507
I'm okay with that,
but I'm not sure you are.

314
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,680
You have to realize I don't think
of you as a thin, beautiful woman.

315
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:02,230
This is one of the things that
I can apologize for later.

316
00:20:04,044 --> 00:20:06,333
What I mean is, you're Monica.

317
00:20:06,585 --> 00:20:09,609
Okay? And I am in love with Monica.

318
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:11,478
Keep going.

319
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:15,696
So you can balloon up
or you can shrink down...

320
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,923
...and I will still love you.

321
00:20:19,596 --> 00:20:22,752
Even if I were to shrink down
to 2 inches tall?

322
00:20:23,841 --> 00:20:25,786
I'd carry you around in my pocket.

323
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,398
I love you.

324
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:34,658
Skidmark still got a way
with the ladies.

325
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:38,615
Hi, Pheebs.

326
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:40,223
- Hi.
- Hi.

327
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,130
I just want to apologize.

328
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,746
I'm really sorry I was a baby.

329
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,471
That's ridiculous.
Rachel, we were all babies once.

330
00:20:51,153 --> 00:20:53,229
Oh, you mean today. Yeah.

331
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:57,724
Yeah, and you know,
you deserve to win.

332
00:20:58,146 --> 00:20:59,843
And I was thinking about it.

333
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:03,224
If you're Monica's maid of honor,
I get to be yours.

334
00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:05,522
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

335
00:21:07,575 --> 00:21:11,157
When Monica and Chandler got engaged,
I put some stuff together.

336
00:21:11,401 --> 00:21:14,283
- Just in case.
- Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks.

337
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:17,759
Here is a book of poetry
that I know Monica loves.

338
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:20,158
Oh, God, this is funny. Look.

339
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:24,196
Here's a picture from one Halloween
where she dressed up as a bride.

340
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:26,002
She made me carry her train...

341
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:29,388
...which was weird
because I was Wonder Woman.

342
00:21:31,268 --> 00:21:33,841
Oh, and here's
a little purse that I found.

343
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:36,897
I just thought they could hold
the rings in there.

344
00:21:37,148 --> 00:21:39,781
- Oh.
- Something. And...

345
00:21:40,035 --> 00:21:44,519
...vintage handkerchiefs, you know,
because people cry at weddings.

346
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:47,162
I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.

347
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,637
This stuff is great.

348
00:21:50,925 --> 00:21:53,178
I forgot this was in here.

349
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:59,272
This was the garter
that I was saving for my wedding.

350
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:03,228
And I wanted it
to be Monica's "something borrowed."

351
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:05,287
And it's blue.

352
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:14,718
Rach, I think that you should be
Monica's maid of honor.

353
00:22:16,845 --> 00:22:18,304
You do?

354
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:22,435
- Why?
- Because I think it means more to you.

355
00:22:23,351 --> 00:22:25,605
But, Pheebs, honey, you earned it.

356
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,942
It's fine.
I mean, this is something...

357
00:22:28,152 --> 00:22:31,758
...that you've been thinking about
since you were, what, 14?

358
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:35,107
No, I was 10.
I just developed early.

359
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:37,959
Man alive!

360
00:22:40,921 --> 00:22:42,688
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey!

361
00:22:42,939 --> 00:22:45,999
We decided Rachel is
going to be your maid of honor.

362
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:48,738
Oh, that's great!

363
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:52,359
Oh, wow. Okay, we really
have to start planning.

364
00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:54,627
I have really specific ideas.

365
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,888
We should meet four times a week.

366
00:22:57,134 --> 00:22:59,981
Come to my place,
we'll get together before work.

367
00:23:00,717 --> 00:23:03,872
What do you say, 6:30, my place?
So excited!

368
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:14,206
Yeah, okay. You laugh now.

369
00:23:14,495 --> 00:23:15,918
She's gonna be yours.

370
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:33,415
Great nap.

371
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,539
It really was.

372
00:23:53,844 --> 00:23:55,647
What the hell are you doing?

373
00:23:56,628 --> 00:23:58,051
God!

374
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:05,940
Excuse me.
