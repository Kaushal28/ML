1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,500
-Okay, Chandler.
-Okay.

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:05,500
And your horoscope says:

3
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:09,163
"On the 5th, a special
someone will give you a gift."

4
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,310
Well, thank you in advance.

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,708
"But the 12th brings a lover's spat."

6
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:17,439
You're going to make fun
of my present.

7
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,079
Why would you do that?

8
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:25,653
Wait. "On the 19th,
a secret crush announces itself."

9
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:32,624
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

10
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:36,131
It's Joey Tribbiani
of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

11
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,033
That's right. It's your first day.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,471
Are you psyched to fight crime
with your robot sidekick?

13
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:46,304
Am I?
The lead in my own TV series?

14
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:49,107
I've dreamed about this for years!

15
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,341
Why have I not been preparing?

16
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:54,516
You're gonna be great.

17
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:58,621
But I gotta act with a robot.
I know nothing about technology.

18
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,692
I can't even use Chandler's computer,
except to find porn.

19
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:06,860
And that's only because
it's there when you turn it on.

20
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,935
Our spat will start early this month.

21
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:12,468
I'll be waiting.

22
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,236
The One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad

23
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:58,674
Are you judging them by their covers?
You're really not supposed to.

24
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,114
I'm deciding which one to use. I'm
going to write another book.

25
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,253
Because the last one
was such a big seller?

26
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,727
If you must know,
I have written 14 books.

27
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,730
And as I'm the only one
who has read them...

28
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:17,391
I can tell you that
they have been well received.

29
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,503
But I lost all of them in the fire.

30
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:26,373
So this one I'm gonna keep in an
asbestos-lined box far away from Rachel.

31
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,780
Who I forgive.

32
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,417
What are you doing later?

33
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,885
Rachel and I have to get our hair cut.

34
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,249
-We do?
-I wanna see what he wants.

35
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,121
Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.

36
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,421
Wait a minute. Hold the phone.

37
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,726
You're not Elizabeth's dad?

38
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,667
That's the only one you get.

39
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:56,567
And he hates me.

40
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,610
He asked Elizabeth why she'd want
to go out with a guy...

41
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,770
who couldn't get a girl his own age.

42
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,274
And what did she say to that?

43
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,550
And that's yours.

44
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,586
Come on. I really want
this guy to like me.

45
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,818
It would really help if you guys
could make me look good.

46
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,054
-Of course we'll help.
-Thanks.

47
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:22,795
We know how tough those
parent-teacher conferences can be.

48
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:30,104
-So here's your office set.
-Wow!

49
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,546
Mac Machiavelli, private investigator.

50
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,779
Look at all the books I've read.

51
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,147
Let's get you to wardrobe.

52
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,419
When do I meet the robot?

53
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,354
Right now. He's right here.

54
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,360
Joey Tribbiani, this is..

55
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,499
Wow! He's so lifelike.

56
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:56,892
Unbelievable.

57
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,539
This is Wayne, the man who created
and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.

58
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,536
How do you do there, buddy?

59
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,767
I'll let you two guys get acquainted.

60
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,276
Sorry about that.

61
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,644
-So where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
-C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.

62
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,388
Nice to meet you, Mac.

63
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:26,558
-This is the temporary robot, right?
-No. Why?

64
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:30,297
I thought it was gonna be
a really cool robot.

65
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:33,768
Like the Terminator,
or when I first saw you.

66
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,467
I spent two years developing this.
It's state of the art.

67
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,647
Sorry. It doesn't look like
it can do anything.

68
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,342
It can do this.

69
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:59,696
This is my father, Paul Stevens.
Dad, this is Ross Geller.

70
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,024
It's great to meet you, Paul.

71
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,832
I prefer that Liz's boyfriends
address me as Mr. Stevens.

72
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,535
Of course. Mr. Stevens.

73
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,335
So, Ross...

74
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,369
what's your problem?

75
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,475
Excuse me?

76
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,876
Why can't you get a girlfriend
your own age?

77
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,284
It's funny...

78
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,554
It's not funny.

79
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,819
I don't like you going out
with my daughter, Ross.

80
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,963
Okay, I can see that.

81
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:36,735
I think if you give me one chance,
I can change your mind.

82
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,334
-Okay.
-What?

83
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,868
Okay. I'll give you one chance
to change my mind.

84
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,270
You've got one minute.

85
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,979
-Daddy.
-Fine. Two minutes. Go.

86
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:58,413
A minute and 50 seconds.

87
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,823
I want you to know, I've
never done anything like this before.

88
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,190
I mean, I've been in relationships
in general.

89
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,562
But I've never done it with a student.
I mean, not...

90
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,167
Not "it." We haven't done "it."

91
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,901
I mean, we've done stuff...

92
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,243
Okay. A joke. Lighten the mood.

93
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,008
Two guys go into a bar.
One of them is Irish.

94
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,316
-I'm Irish.
-And the Irish guy wins the joke.

95
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,028
Ross! How crazy
that we would run into you.

96
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,225
Oh, my God! Thank you.

97
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:44,298
I'd like you to meet my friends.
This is Phoebe, Monica and Chandler.

98
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:45,895
-Phoebe.
-Hello.

99
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,300
-Monica.
-Hi.

100
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:48,997
Chunder.

101
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,166
-Chandler.
-Never going to remember that.

102
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,844
You're Elizabeth's dad?
I see where she gets her...

103
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,779
rugged handsomeness.

104
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,982
Is there a Mrs. Stevens?

105
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,181
There's a Mr. Bing!

106
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:13,192
Unfortunately, Lizzie's mom passed
away after she was born.

107
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,092
I raised her by myself.

108
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,469
I get that a lot.

109
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,101
Why don't we all take a seat?

110
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,676
I'll get us all some coffees.

111
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,503
Yeah, why don't you...

112
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,282
Talk about
whatever you want.

113
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,318
Whatever pops into your head.

114
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,954
It is strange seeing Ross here,
this time of day...

115
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,889
because usually
he's at the children's hospital.

116
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,126
But not looking for dates.

117
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,527
Monica is Ross's sister.

118
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,463
He's a great brother!

119
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,539
I had a sister.

120
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,276
She passed away.

121
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,045
You don't have to do that every time.

122
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:05,544
But Ross is a great guy.
I was roommates with him in college.

123
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,048
Funny story...

124
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,387
Your roommate in college died,
didn't he?

125
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,851
A part of him did, yes.

126
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,257
Here we are, Paul, Elizabeth.

127
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,092
I hope you guys are finding
something to talk about.

128
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,234
-Yes. We were just..
-Sorry I'm late.

129
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,599
But I am ready to talk you up.

130
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,038
-When does Liz's father get here?
-I'm already here.

131
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,445
Ross is so great!

132
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,316
Hey, Phoebe.
How's the book writing going?

133
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,046
Really well. I'm up to page 47.

134
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,281
-Wow! What are you writing?
-Page numbers.

135
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,950
Honey, you got the kind
with the little girl.

136
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,292
You said you'd buy the kind
with the baby.

137
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:54,557
-You said the baby creeps you out.
-The little girl does.

138
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,299
-You said the baby.
-Why would a baby creep me out?

139
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:00,233
Why would the little girl
creep you out?

140
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,806
Can you please talk a little slower?

141
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,341
-This is for your book?
-It's about relationships.

142
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,070
The traps, the pitfalls,
what not to do.

143
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,442
Keep going. This stuff's great.

144
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,811
Excuse me.

145
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:17,422
And how none of it matters when
the people really love each other.

146
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,995
And how people will believe anything
as long as it's a compliment.

147
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,062
-Oh, hi!
-Hi.

148
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:36,131
-I left my keys here somewhere.
-Well, let's look for them.

149
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,141
Hey, look! Are these them?

150
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,245
No.

151
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,213
All right.

152
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,877
-Here they are.
-Good.

153
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,919
-Thanks for your help.
-Wait! Sorry!

154
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,023
-Mr. Paul?
-Just call me Paul.

155
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,194
Paul.
I just wanted you to know that...

156
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,590
Ross really is a great guy.

157
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,992
Maybe you could date him. It'd
save me the trouble of killing him.

158
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:08,462
Are you okay?

159
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,672
You don't look old enough
to have a 20-year-old daughter.

160
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,277
Well, we were very young
when we had her.

161
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,938
-We?
-It usually takes two people to...

162
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,017
Oh, no! Yes! Of course. I know that!

163
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,021
What I meant was are you still "we"
or are you just you?

164
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,486
I'm just me.

165
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,956
My wife died shortly after
Lizzie was born.

166
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,526
So you raised her all on your own?

167
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,028
Yes, I did.

168
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,334
-What are you writing there?
-I'm drawing a picture of you.

169
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,702
Well, that's very flattering.

170
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,475
But it'd be great if you could draw me
with some clothes and a head.

171
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,515
How was your first day?

172
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,247
Pretty good. Except I got
attitude from the robot.

173
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:03,186
Damn those robots. They're supposed
to be our faithful servants!

174
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,763
It was the guy who controls the robot.

175
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:10,424
He hates me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E.
knock over the sandwich table...

176
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,729
right when I was reaching for one.

177
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,599
Why don't you get him fired?

178
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:18,334
I may have to. I hate to do it.
But I'm the star, you know?

179
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:23,307
There's a limit to how many sandwiches
I can eat off the floor.

180
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,408
Excuse me.

181
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,682
Joey Tribbiani.

182
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,415
Joe! I'm glad I found you!
I got an audition for you.

183
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,687
But it's kind of on the q.t.

184
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:39,592
The actor who has the part
doesn't know he might be fired.

185
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,824
It's the lead in a series.

186
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,558
Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

187
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,230
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

188
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,312
Joey?

189
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,174
Hi, Ross.

190
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,850
I was just getting him to like you.

191
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,086
Joey!

192
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,426
Ross, Joey is not here.

193
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,724
I'll just wait for him in here!

194
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,628
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.

195
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,732
Yeah. It's okay. It's me...

196
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,337
Mr. Stevens.

197
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,207
I didn't... Oh, my gosh.
I didn't even see you.

198
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,008
You did. You came in, got all awkward
and ran to the bedroom.

199
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,913
You were shouting, "Joey!"

200
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,954
-Bye, Rachel.
-Bye.

201
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,146
I'll call you later.

202
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,915
-See you.
-Bye, Ross.

203
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,590
What? What the..? How did...? What?

204
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:53,271
You know, he lost his keys.
So he was looking for them.

205
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,962
In your mouth?

206
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,475
No!

207
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,703
Downstairs. And we got to talking...

208
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,906
for two hours. I liked him.
I invited him for coffee.

209
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,947
You were at the coffeehouse!

210
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,188
What's the big deal?
So I kissed the guy.

211
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,951
He is my girlfriend's father.
It's weird!

212
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,629
-You dated my sister!
-That was different!

213
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,795
-What? Why?
-This is weird for me!

214
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,768
Ross, look. This is good for you.

215
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,332
Let's face it.
So far the guy's not loving you.

216
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,002
But I can turn that around.
I've got the inside track.

217
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:39,515
We could all go out to dinner.
And I could talk you up.

218
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:43,321
Plus the guy
is a very successful lawyer.

219
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:47,558
-How is that important?
-It's important!

220
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,092
There's a million guys
who can play Mac...

221
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,560
and there's one robot.

222
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:57,429
And this one guy who controls it.
I didn't know he could get me fired.

223
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:01,663
-What am I gonna do?
-You're a pretty charming guy.

224
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,533
Thanks. But I have a problem
to deal with.

225
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:08,176
No, you've got to win over
the guy who controls C.H.E.E.S.E.

226
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,146
Go back there
and kiss some serious robot ass!

227
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,744
That's not a bad idea!

228
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:20,117
If I have to be charming tomorrow,
I'm not wasting it on you guys.

229
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,692
I got some saved for you, Phoebe.

230
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,298
Do you think Joey is
more charming than me?

231
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,032
Yeah. That's why I'm sleeping
with him on the side.

232
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,031
You wish.

233
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,500
"You wish."

234
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,106
Stop writing about us.

235
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,612
I'm not writing about you.
I'm writing about other people.

236
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,818
-Who?
-Marsha and Chester.

237
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,981
Fine. Then you know what?
I will just write about Phyllis.

238
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,594
-"Phyllis is sitting in the chair."
-I see what you're doing.

239
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,432
"Phyllis sees what I'm doing."

240
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,970
I have tasted my own medicine
and it is bitter!

241
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,239
Morning!

242
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,338
How's my favorite genius
and his robot?

243
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,676
-Don't touch him!
-Okay.

244
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,886
Level with me. I keep hearing
rumors that I might get fired.

245
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,217
They even have actors reading
for my part.

246
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,153
Come on. You gotta give me
a second chance.

247
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,025
I love this little guy.

248
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,030
That's why you didn't want me
to touch him, right?

249
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,001
I can't believe it. God!

250
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,870
Hey, how are you doing?

251
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:57,086
So it seemed that my prom date
had stood me up.

252
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,950
So Ross selflessly offered to take me.

253
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,322
What a nice story.

254
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,157
So Ross was in college...

255
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:10,996
and decided to jump at the chance
to take a young girl to her prom.

256
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:16,333
I definitely did not see
that one backfiring.

257
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,267
-I'm going to the bathroom.
-Take your time.

258
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,781
I was a freshman and she was a senior.
So it wasn't as bad as..

259
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,985
Look. I know I've been giving you
a lot of jabs.

260
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,388
It's partly because
I'm very protective of Lizzie...

261
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:40,057
and partly because
they just keep coming to me.

262
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:45,169
I admit after all the
wonderful things Lizzie told me...

263
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:50,604
and the many, many, many stories
that Rachel has told me...

264
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:52,637
well...

265
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,774
you're not...

266
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,742
all bad.

267
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:01,479
"Not all bad."

268
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:05,685
I'm sorry I was so harsh.
But you have to understand.

269
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,816
I still look at Lizzie
like she's a 12-year-old girl.

270
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,026
I know what you mean. I do that too.

271
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:20,165
-I beg your pardon?
-I don't see her as a 12-year-old.

272
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:24,899
I mean, I have a son who is 6
and I still think of him as a baby.

273
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:29,877
-A son?
-My ex-wife and I share custody of Ben.

274
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,382
Incidentally, Carol and I
are on excellent terms...

275
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,780
as I'm sure you are with your wife.

276
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,080
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,024
It's unbelievable!

278
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,555
Don't worry. I didn't realize
you were married.

279
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,463
We were. But that was just a...

280
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,661
That was just a big drunken mistake.

281
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,536
You're back.

282
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,403
You two were married?

283
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,908
I'm sorry.
You were talking about Emily.

284
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,418
We said we would meet
at the coffeehouse at 6:00.

285
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,648
We said 7:00.

286
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,390
We said 6:00!

287
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,457
The only way that I said 6:00...

288
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:21,429
would be if I said the sentence,
"Let's meet at 7:00, not at 6:00."

289
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,863
If I had said 7:00, I would have said:

290
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,699
"My boyfriend is such a
wiseass. 7:00!"

291
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,901
-Hi!
-Oh, my good God!

292
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,771
-I know what time you said.
-What?

293
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:38,615
Well, I know what time
Chester and Marsha said.

294
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,576
What time?

295
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:42,811
Interesting turn of events.

296
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,457
Suddenly it's my book to the rescue.
Let's see.

297
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,058
Very interesting.

298
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,223
Well this certainly clears things up.

299
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,057
What does it say?

300
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,527
I will tell you as soon as you thank
me for writing my book.

301
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,529
Thank you for writing your book.
It's a great book...

302
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,370
and you are the
queen of everything.

303
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,676
Thanks. So are you.

304
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,983
I told you I should
not wear this color.

305
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:26,255
"Monica.. Marsha and Chester are
planning on seeing a movie Sunday.

306
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:31,434
"Marsha thinks they're meeting at
6:00. Chester thinks it's 7:00."

307
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,197
-You knew we were gonna miss the movie?
-Right.

308
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:40,101
Instead of telling us, you decided
to write it in your stupid book?

309
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,804
"Marsha and Chester
are mad at Phyllis."

310
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,680
I can't believe
I'm gonna lose this job.

311
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,457
I'm so sorry, man.
Is there anything I can do?

312
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:58,122
Help me get this mini-fridge
past the security guard.

313
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,028
Joey, I want to talk to you.

314
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,704
I don't want to talk to you.

315
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,501
I hate you. You ruined my life.

316
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,702
-Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
-Hi.

317
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,939
I'll get you your job back
if you help me out.

318
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,246
Why should I help you out?

319
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:23,548
-The reason he just said.
-What do you need?

320
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,083
I saw you on stage talking
to that beautiful woman.

321
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,660
You know, Sarah.
I wish I could talk to her.

322
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,055
-Are you in love with her?
-Yeah.

323
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,160
Her. All of them. Anyone.

324
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,332
Yeah. I've been there, my friend.

325
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,200
Listen, I guarantee you
keep your job...

326
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,503
if you can teach me to talk
to women like you do.

327
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:51,641
You can't teach it.
It's something you're born with.

328
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,081
You can teach it.
I can show you right now.

329
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,449
-Really?
-Sure. Yeah. I taught him.

330
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:01,320
Yeah. You should see the woman I'm with,
way out of my league.

331
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,825
In fact, if you want, I can get you her.

332
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,690
Well, if you think about it...

333
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,928
Ross did learn something
from each marriage.

334
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,437
How to make the next one even shorter?

335
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,302
Wait a minute. That's not fair.

336
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,603
He was married to me a hell of a lot
longer than he was to Emily.

337
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,679
He just didn't tell me.

338
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,649
Maybe I have to pee again.

339
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,125
Well, this is fun.

340
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,492
So, Ross, did you kill any
of these wives?

341
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,428
I have had enough of this! I
care a great deal about your daughter.

342
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,038
And I have treated her with respect!

343
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,471
So if you've got a problem with me..

344
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,575
-Are you yelling at me?
-God, no.

345
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:59,547
You know what?
If you don't like Ross, that's fine.

346
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:03,181
It doesn't matter.
I'm going out with him anyway.

347
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,356
Really?

348
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,924
Well, if it doesn't matter to her...

349
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:12,052
it doesn't matter to me.
Still not yelling.

350
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,163
What can I say?

351
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,467
I still don't like you.

352
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:25,404
I'm not so crazy
about myself right now either.

353
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,772
-Then we agree?
-I guess so.

354
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,047
-Neither of us like Ross.
-I like Ross.

355
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,548
Kids!

356
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,185
I just thought of a story
about how nice Ross is.

357
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,955
That's okay.
We're not liking Ross right now.

358
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,793
Well, I got a lot of those too.

359
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,857
You were right, C.H.E.E.S.E.

360
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,762
-The shipment never made it to Omaha?
-You got it.

361
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:57,237
And the rabbi's beard?
100 percent horsehair.

362
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:00,707
Nice catch, C.H.E.E.S.E.

363
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,941
It's your line, C.H.E.E.S.E.

364
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,481
Wayne! Wayne!
