1
00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:06,666
Listen, sir, for the last time,
I don't care what the computer says.

2
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:10,086
We did not take a bag of Mashuga Nuts
from the minibar.

3
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:14,006
And we did not watch
Dr. Do-Me-A-Little.

4
00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:20,638
-Joey, were you in our room last night?
-No.

5
00:00:28,438 --> 00:00:32,275
I was told the name of the movie
would not appear on the bill.

6
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:38,322
-We're checking out of the bridal suite.
-That's right, I'm no longer a bride.

7
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,702
I'll never be a bride again.
Now I'm just someone's wife.

8
00:00:44,162 --> 00:00:47,039
And I'm the happiest guy in the world.

9
00:00:48,124 --> 00:00:51,544
Honey, don't be upset. We still have
so much to look forward to.

10
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:53,087
Yeah, right.

11
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:56,299
-We got the honeymoon.
-That's not till Thursday.

12
00:00:56,466 --> 00:00:58,968
-The wedding pictures.
-It won't be ready for weeks.

13
00:00:59,135 --> 00:01:01,721
Not the disposable cameras
from the tables.

14
00:01:01,888 --> 00:01:04,974
That's true.
I knew I married you for a reason!

15
00:01:05,475 --> 00:01:09,228
Tell you what, I will go get them
developed, and you can go home.

16
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:15,943
-What? What did you take a picture of?
-Nothing.

17
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,778
It was something.

18
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:21,574
Ross has the cameras.
Has he checked out yet?

19
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:24,952
Are you joking?
Checkout is not till noon.

20
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,415
-And he has a good 11 minutes left.
-So?

21
00:01:29,582 --> 00:01:32,877
So Ross had never checked out of a room
a minute before he had to.

22
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:35,880
One time, when we were dating,
we got a late checkout.

23
00:01:36,047 --> 00:01:39,467
He got so excited,
it was the best sex we ever had.

24
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:43,387
Until he screamed out "Radisson"
at the end.

25
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:48,935
Okay, well, I'm gonna get Ross,
get the cameras and get them developed.

26
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:53,689
32, Joe. You're 32!

27
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:58,486
-Here's a copy of your bill.
-Thanks.

28
00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:02,073
Champagne, strawberries..

29
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:07,787
Oh, my God! I can't believe Chandler
ordered porn on our wedding night.

30
00:02:09,622 --> 00:02:13,501
Yeah, that's sad.
Mashuga Nut?

31
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:56,669
I have six minutes left!

32
00:02:56,836 --> 00:02:58,087
It's me.

33
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:06,554
Soaps, shampoos.
Are you really taking all this stuff?

34
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:09,765
Why not?
It's built into the price of the room.

35
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:13,686
Yeah, but you don't need..
What is this?

36
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:15,563
Thread.

37
00:03:16,814 --> 00:03:18,399
Score!

38
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,820
-Where are the disposable cameras?
-What cameras?

39
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:25,990
-Last night I asked you to take them.
-No, you didn't.

40
00:03:26,157 --> 00:03:29,452
Yes, remember?
Right before we cut the cake, I said..

41
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:32,121
Yeah, you asked me
if I could do you a favor.

42
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:35,374
Then my Uncle Murray came up to you
and handed you a check.

43
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:39,837
Then you said, "Why is it called
a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?"

44
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:46,969
Then you did that,
and my Uncle Murray looked at me like:

45
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:51,015
-So you don't have the cameras?
-No, sorry.

46
00:03:51,182 --> 00:03:53,893
So, what? They're gone?
Monica's gonna freak!

47
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,937
I'm sure they're here somewhere.
I'll help you look.

48
00:03:57,146 --> 00:03:59,357
-Great.
-In three minutes.

49
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:20,419
Are you gonna open the presents
without Chandler?

50
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:23,589
No! I'm just..

51
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,845
They're calling out to me. This
little guy even crawled up in my lap.

52
00:04:30,262 --> 00:04:35,017
Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just
one present. What do you think it is?

53
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:38,396
A little mirror that,
when you look into it..

54
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:41,357
you see yourself as an old woman.

55
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:45,778
A tiny salt shaker!

56
00:04:45,987 --> 00:04:49,865
Oh, my God, for tiny salt!

57
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:54,203
Oh, wow! Okay. Well, that was fun.
That was fun.

58
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,707
Okay, I'll just wait for Chandler
to open up the rest of them.

59
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:04,797
Although, you know, this is part
of a salt-and-pepper set.

60
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:08,509
It may just count as only half
a present. What do you think?

61
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:13,055
I guess it's okay to open one more if it's
part of a set. It's probably this one.

62
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:14,974
Or this one!

63
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:22,815
-How are you? Got any morning sickness?
-The guys don't know yet, do they?

64
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:26,485
Joey and Ross don't know anything.
Chandler thinks Phoebe's pregnant.

65
00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:29,822
That's right.
Chandler does still think I'm pregnant.

66
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:34,118
He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling
or offered to carry my bags.

67
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:37,621
I feel bad for the woman
who ends up with him.

68
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:41,709
After you, of course.

69
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:45,379
Don't worry. You only have to be
pregnant for a few more hours..

70
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,506
because I'm telling the father today.

71
00:05:47,673 --> 00:05:50,676
Is it someone in the building?
That tall guy on the first floor?

72
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:54,638
-No!
-What? I think he's cute.

73
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:58,142
-Then you have his baby.
-Believe me, I'm trying.

74
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:02,855
It's so weird.
You're gonna tell this guy today..

75
00:06:03,022 --> 00:06:05,608
and he has no idea
what's gonna happen.

76
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:10,821
You're just gonna knock on his door
and change his life forever.

77
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:14,450
You're like Ed McMahon,
except without the big check.

78
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:17,369
Or the raw sexual magnetism.

79
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:22,249
Yeah, well, I guess
it is pretty big news.

80
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,711
Pretty big? It's huge!
God, this guy doesn't have a clue.

81
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,841
He's just walking down the street thinking,
"I had sex with Rachel Greene. I rock!"

82
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:34,470
Then, bam! He's a father,
everything's different.

83
00:06:34,637 --> 00:06:38,808
It's only different if he wants it to be.
I'm not gonna ask him for anything.

84
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:41,060
He still has this huge decision
to make.

85
00:06:41,227 --> 00:06:45,314
Now he's walking around thinking,
"Do I want to be a dad?" Then, bam!

86
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:47,233
What was that "bam"?

87
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:51,112
I don't know.
He's hit by a bus, or something.

88
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:58,911
Joey, what would you do if someone you
slept with told you she was pregnant?

89
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:06,919
Who called here?

90
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,883
Did she sound blond? Did she have
an accent? I gotta make a call.

91
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,053
Should have never walked
into that Sunglass Hut!

92
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:20,266
It's not you!
You didn't get anybody pregnant.

93
00:07:20,558 --> 00:07:24,937
Why would you scare me like that?
What the hell's going on?

94
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:29,441
Is somebody pregnant?

95
00:07:30,568 --> 00:07:32,444
Oh, yeah! That's me.

96
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:37,825
Oh, my God, Pheebs!
You're gonna have a baby?

97
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:42,872
Yes, I am.
Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a baby!

98
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:46,709
-Wait a minute, who's the father?
-You don't know him.

99
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:51,422
It's not important. He wants nothing
to do with me or the baby.

100
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:59,930
Who is this guy? Because I will
track him down and kick his ass!

101
00:08:00,723 --> 00:08:03,517
-David Linn.
-David Linn!

102
00:08:07,062 --> 00:08:11,066
-Who's David Linn?
-Some guy from my gym. Little annoying.

103
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,658
-Chandler?
-Did you find the cameras?

104
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,577
-No. Did you?
-Yes.

105
00:08:21,744 --> 00:08:24,830
That's why I'm under the table,
celebrating.

106
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:30,002
I checked in the lost and found. I talked
to the manager. No one's turned them in.

107
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:35,090
Great. Those cameras were the only thing
that was gonna cheer Monica up today.

108
00:08:35,257 --> 00:08:38,052
You just got married.
Why is she so depressed?

109
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,556
All my energy is going
into not asking that question.

110
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:46,810
-I can't believe I screwed this up!
-I'm sorry, man.

111
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:53,067
Here's a thought.
This is the same ballroom.

112
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:56,737
There's a band. There's gonna be
plenty of dressed-up people.

113
00:08:56,904 --> 00:09:00,032
Are you suggesting
we dance our troubles away?

114
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:03,869
No, I'm saying we buy more of these
at the gift shop..

115
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:06,538
throw our tuxes back on
and take a few pictures.

116
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:09,667
We just have to make sure
not to get anybody's faces.

117
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,335
Are you serious?

118
00:09:11,502 --> 00:09:13,879
I'm thinking about
your new bride at home.

119
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:17,216
Do you want to start your life together
by letting her down?

120
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:20,427
Marriage advice? Really?

121
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:25,557
I'm telling you,
this looks exactly like your wedding.

122
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,936
-Aren't these the same flowers?
-I don't know. Monica picked them.

123
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:31,271
-What about the chairs?
-Those too.

124
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,232
-The place settings?
-Her.

125
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:36,568
-What did you do?
-I was in charge of the cameras.

126
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:38,445
Gift shop?

127
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:47,579
-Did you do it yet?
-Not yet.

128
00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:51,458
Then what are you doing here?
Are you about to do it?

129
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,460
Is it Gunther?

130
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:59,800
-It's not Gunther!
-Thank God. Because that hair on a baby?

131
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,763
The father is not here, okay?
I haven't told him yet.

132
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,350
-I don't think I can tell him at all now.
-Why not?

133
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:14,273
I was walking down the street, thinking,
"I'm gonna tell the father." And then, bam!

134
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:16,942
Bus?

135
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:23,365
No, you! You freaked me out.
You kept saying how huge this all is.

136
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:24,867
But it is huge.

137
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:28,495
I know. But I was just thinking about
how huge it was for me.

138
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:31,498
I didn't even go to how huge it'll be
for the father.

139
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:36,295
You're thinking about this way too much.
Just tell him and get it over with.

140
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:40,674
It's like ripping off this Band-Aid,
quick and painless. Watch.

141
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,760
Oh, mother of..!

142
00:10:45,137 --> 00:10:46,764
See?

143
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:57,441
-Are we opening presents?
-No. I shouldn't have even opened these.

144
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,613
Joey, I am out of control!
You have to do me a favor.

145
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,115
No matter what I say,
no matter what I do..

146
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:08,327
please, do not let me open
another present. Okay?

147
00:11:11,747 --> 00:11:13,582
Give me one more.

148
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:20,881
Oh, good, you're here.
Pheebs? Listen..

149
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:24,676
-Sit down, I got something I wanna say.
-All right.

150
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,064
It's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.

151
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:41,026
I've always felt that you
and I have a special bond.

152
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:42,694
So..

153
00:11:44,446 --> 00:11:47,616
Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

154
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,539
Oh, my God!

155
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,210
Oh, yeah, I'll marry you.

156
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:04,299
-You can't marry him!
-Hey, lady, your day's over. It's my turn.

157
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:08,929
-Why can't she marry me?
-I can and I will.

158
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:15,060
She's not pregnant.
Rachel's the one who's pregnant.

159
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:17,146
Oh, my God!

160
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,691
He'd notice when you didn't
have a baby in nine months!

161
00:12:20,858 --> 00:12:22,901
It's Joey!

162
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:25,696
I love you.

163
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:32,369
Wait, I can't believe it!
Rachel's pregnant? Who's the father?

164
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:34,121
We don't know.

165
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:39,877
-I wonder if it's that dude.
-There's a dude?

166
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:41,545
Who is it?

167
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:44,923
About a month ago
this guy spent the night with Rachel.

168
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,551
I didn't see who it was, but..

169
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:55,100
Was that story over?

170
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,939
The guy left this.

171
00:13:01,356 --> 00:13:05,736
Oh, my God!
I know who the father is.

172
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,784
People have got
to finish their stories.

173
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,504
Hello.

174
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:30,260
I don't know if we're both in.
Come closer.

175
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:32,638
Nice aftershave.

176
00:13:32,804 --> 00:13:36,141
If you want some,
I've got eight mini bottles in my bag.

177
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:40,145
-Excuse me, could you take a picture of us?
-Of course.

178
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:46,735
Would you take one of us?

179
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,488
Yeah, sure.

180
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,199
Click.

181
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:55,869
-It didn't click.
-I heard it.

182
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:59,498
-But there was no flash.
-Why won't you take our picture?

183
00:13:59,665 --> 00:14:02,334
Oh, yeah. I'll take your picture.

184
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,255
Your finger was covering the lens.

185
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:09,424
Who are you, Ansel Adams?
Get out of here!

186
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,516
Look, I feel really bad about
how I freaked you out before..

187
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:20,852
so I asked the father to meet you here
so you could tell him.

188
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:25,107
What? Wait a minute.
How do you even know who the father is?

189
00:14:25,357 --> 00:14:28,527
I may play the fool at times..

190
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:33,365
but I'm more than a pretty blond girl
with an ass that won't quit.

191
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:38,537
I believe this belongs
to the father of your baby..

192
00:14:38,704 --> 00:14:43,792
Oh, God. He's in there right now?

193
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:49,798
You can turn around, or you can go rip
the Band-Aid off. What do you want to do?

194
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,552
-Let's rip.
-Are you sure?

195
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:56,096
-Phoebe!
-Okay. Sorry.

196
00:14:58,974 --> 00:15:00,559
Hey, Rach.

197
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:11,862
Why don't you go up on-stage.
I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.

198
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,759
Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre
please see the front desk?

199
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:36,178
Your car is about to be towed.

200
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,932
That's my car!

201
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:45,187
-A '95 LeSabre?
-Yes.

202
00:15:45,687 --> 00:15:48,190
-A green LeSabre?
-Yes!

203
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:54,780
-I'm sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.
-Yes, green-blue.

204
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,495
Well, go. Go move it!

205
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:06,083
Ready for the last picture?
Get ready to run.

206
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,383
Congratulations on your wedding.

207
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:22,766
So, what's this about?

208
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:25,477
Rachel has something
she wants to tell you.

209
00:16:25,644 --> 00:16:29,898
And I believe that
this is your red sweater.

210
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:34,152
No, this is my red sweater.

211
00:16:36,488 --> 00:16:38,365
Oh, no.

212
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:44,246
Could I get anyone a coffee?

213
00:16:44,788 --> 00:16:47,707
Or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.

214
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:51,169
What's going on, Rach?

215
00:16:51,336 --> 00:16:55,716
Nothing.
Phoebe kind of made a mistake.

216
00:16:56,007 --> 00:17:01,054
But you do wear that sweater a lot.
Are you involved in some kind of dare?

217
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,016
I'm actually glad Phoebe called.

218
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,483
I know we broke up because you thought
I was immature, but I've grown up.

219
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,944
I think we should get back together.

220
00:17:16,194 --> 00:17:18,780
It's just not the right time.

221
00:17:18,947 --> 00:17:23,744
It is the right time.
I'm ready for more.

222
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,288
Come on, Rach.
Let's give it another try.

223
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,541
I'm having a baby.

224
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:40,135
-You can go.
-Thank you.

225
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:48,226
I don't know how
any of these got opened!

226
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:53,440
-You opened them all?
-I know, I am a terrible person.

227
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:57,486
Chandler's never gonna trust me
with anything ever again.

228
00:17:58,028 --> 00:17:59,654
You got my parents' gift.

229
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:03,617
-What is that?
-I think it does something to salami.

230
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,165
-How'd it go?
-What did Tag say?

231
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:13,752
Tag is not the father.
And Joey knows now?

232
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,881
I do, Rach, I do.
And I am so happy for you.

233
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:24,095
Wow, you didn't even try
to unhook my bra.

234
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:31,978
-So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
-I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.

235
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:36,107
No matter what this guy says,
you're not gonna be alone in this.

236
00:18:36,274 --> 00:18:39,110
-I'm not?
-No. Listen..

237
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:47,828
It's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.

238
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:53,333
I've always felt like you and I have
this special bond, you know?

239
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,044
-Rachel Greene, will you marry me?
-What?

240
00:18:56,211 --> 00:18:58,296
-What?
-What?!

241
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:02,133
-Pheebs, give me the ring back.
-No!

242
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:08,765
Joey, you're so sweet, so sweet, honey.
But I'm not looking for a husband.

243
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:14,271
I understand.

244
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:21,236
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go and lie down.

245
00:19:28,451 --> 00:19:31,663
What? I proposed to you.
It balances out.

246
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:40,005
I can't say that didn't hurt.

247
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,467
But I'll take you back, Joey Tribbiani.

248
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:48,096
-Listen, about that, I only offered..
-Ooh, a Salami Buddy!

249
00:19:48,263 --> 00:19:49,723
There you go!

250
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:53,101
-We're back!
-Great.

251
00:19:53,268 --> 00:19:56,771
We're hanging in the kitchen.
Let's stay in the kitchen.

252
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:01,276
-It's picture time.
-You're gonna love these.

253
00:20:01,443 --> 00:20:03,653
Here's a picture of Ross.

254
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:06,406
And that's me.

255
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:09,868
And that's me and Ross.

256
00:20:11,536 --> 00:20:15,373
And here's a picture of our first kiss
as a married couple.

257
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:18,877
Wow, that is a great picture. Yeah!

258
00:20:19,044 --> 00:20:23,423
And interesting, because I found
the cameras in one of our bags.

259
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:29,137
Didn't see that coming.

260
00:20:29,304 --> 00:20:32,390
So this isn't a picture
of our first kiss..

261
00:20:32,557 --> 00:20:36,561
but it is a picture
of my first kiss with this lady.

262
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,901
Which, by the look on your face, I'm sure
you'll remember, so there's no need..

263
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:49,074
-I'll take the real pictures to get developed.
-Good idea.

264
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:57,332
You opened all the presents without me?
We were gonna do that together.

265
00:20:57,499 --> 00:20:59,793
You kissed another woman?!

266
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:02,962
-Call it even?
-Okay.

267
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:14,099
-I'm gonna go get these in some water.
-You stole those from that wedding?

268
00:21:14,265 --> 00:21:18,520
No, the hotel lobby. They think they can
charge me for some dirty movie..

269
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:22,148
and a bag of Mashuga Nuts,
they got another thing coming!

270
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:27,988
Hey, my sweater!

271
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:33,576
I've been looking for this
for, like, a month.

272
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,458
Oh, my God!

273
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:49,134
Oh, my God!

274
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,853
-Hey, how you doing?
-Good. Long time no see.

275
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:04,482
-Like your sweater.
-Right back at you.

276
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:12,032
-It's crazy about Rachel.
-Well, she's one crazy lady.

277
00:22:12,782 --> 00:22:17,704
-So whose is it?
-I don't know, some Italian guy.

278
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:23,460
Come on, read your own label.
See you later. He is so weird.
