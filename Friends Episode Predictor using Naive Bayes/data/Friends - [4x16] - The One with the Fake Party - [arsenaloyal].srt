1
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:12,105
Cereal killer.

2
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,110
Cereal killer?

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,646
Hey, come on, I say more
dumb things before 9 a.m...

4
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:19,250
...than most people say all day.

5
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,043
What?

6
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:26,248
I can't find anything that I wanna eat.
Everything makes me nauseous.

7
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,326
I'm telling you, being pregnant
is no piece of cake. Oh, cake!

8
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:31,886
No.

9
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,198
Honey, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:40,203
What is that smell?
It's coming from the bathroom.

11
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,799
Pregnancy does give you
some weird cravings.

12
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:49,214
It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen, there's
something in here I want to eat.

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,641
What smells so good?

14
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:56,885
-ls it the shampoo? It's guava.
-No.

15
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,390
Wait.

16
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,720
Is it my bologna sandwich?

17
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,727
Yes. Yes. Yes.

18
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:11,164
I can't believe it. The baby wants bologna.
The baby wants meat. I can't eat meat.

19
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,733
Wait!

20
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,598
Maybe it's the pickle!

21
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,577
The One With the Fake Party

22
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,451
What are you writing?

23
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:11,959
Joshua's coming in tomorrow, and since
I don't have the guts to ask him out...

24
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:15,657
...I'm gonna sell him a coat
and put this note in the pocket.

25
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,629
"Joshua, give me a call sometime.
Guys like you...

26
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,102
...never go out of style."

27
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,235
What did you throw away?

28
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,348
-Hi, guys.
-What have you guys been up to?

29
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:35,815
We went to see a collection of
Victorian doorknobs at the museum.

30
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,488
Without me?

31
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,820
My uncle dragged us there,
but it turned out to be really interesting.

32
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,031
They were so ornate and beautiful.
Look at that.

33
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:50,692
I don't know how museums work in England,
but here, you're not supposed to take stuff.

34
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,435
I got it from the gift shop.

35
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,573
They have really lax security there.

36
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,710
It's a joke.

37
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,473
Anyone for more tea?

38
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,014
No, just me then.

39
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,980
Hey, Ringo.

40
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,289
Every time Emily's around, you talk
like her. Would you please cut it out?

41
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,485
I think you like it.

42
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,496
I think you can't resist me when I do it.

43
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,193
You want to eat me up
like a cream "pumpy."

44
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:28,969
-What?
-All right, look, I don't know all the words.

45
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,306
Right. I've got to be off.
I'll see you. Bye-bye, then.

46
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,381
Bye-bye, then.

47
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,653
You guys seem to be having a good time.

48
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:45,917
She is amazing,
and she's so much fun.

49
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,855
And you know what?
When I'm with her, I'm fun!

50
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:55,222
I do things like run off to Vermont...

51
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,234
...and you guys saw the doorknob.

52
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,366
I even signed up
for helicopter classes.

53
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,711
She's leaving in two days.
I don't have to do it.

54
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,239
Two days?
You must be bummed.

55
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,545
She's got to go back to London, but
I've been prepared for this from the start.

56
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,483
We both knew we had two weeks together,
and then that's it.

57
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,386
Hey, that's what all
my relationships are like.

58
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,391
Yes, but in Ross' case,
they both know in two weeks that's it.

59
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,027
-Pheebs!
-Hello. Hello.

60
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,226
No, I know. Yeah.

61
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,572
So the baby is totally craving meat.

62
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:40,404
I tried tricking it, and I made it a soy burger,
so that maybe it'd think it was getting meat.

63
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,511
And I got nauseous.

64
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,976
Maybe that's because soy burgers suck.

65
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,651
But I'm no obstetrician....

66
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,782
Being pregnant is hard on your tummy.

67
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,993
At least you got that
cool, pregnant-lady glow.

68
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:59,290
That's sweat. You throw up all morning,
you'll have that glow too.

69
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,729
Okay.

70
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:12,139
-Here's that trench coat that you wanted.
-Great.

71
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:15,671
It's comfortable.

72
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,815
You could really
flash somebody in this.

73
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:24,352
No. They don't want you to put your hands in
the pockets until you are out of the store.

74
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,618
Why not?

75
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,420
Well, because...

76
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,992
...we get a lot of

77
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,026
They ruin it for everybody.

78
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,496
I know.

79
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,237
I wore that sweater
on a date last night.

80
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,364
It was the first date
since the divorce.

81
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,271
Congratulations.
So do you love her?

82
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,045
She's nice,
but it made me realize...

83
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,117
...I'm just not ready to be dating.

84
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,750
That's interesting.

85
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,021
-What was that?
-Just an anti-theft device.

86
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,366
Then what's this?

87
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:12,695
You need that too, because
a thief could just tear this up.

88
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:22,911
We have to have a party in five minutes,
so everybody cancel your plans.

89
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,312
What's going on?

90
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,543
We have to have
a bon-voyage party for Emily.

91
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,380
But it's actually for Joshua.

92
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,159
That sucks. Nobody's ever thrown me
a bon-voyage-Emily party.

93
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,327
He said he's not ready to date.

94
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,795
So I had to invite him to a party
if I wanted to see him outside of work.

95
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:46,667
And now I have created
the perfect opportunity to seduce him.

96
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,707
As much as I'd like
to meet Josh and warn him...

97
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:56,671
...Emily and I won't be here.
She's gonna come by to say goodbye...

98
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:01,013
...and then I've got a special evening
planned. Sorry. No party.

99
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,484
-Hello?
-Surprise!

100
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,790
Surprise!

101
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,092
No one's thrown me
a surprise party before.

102
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,098
Well, it was all Ross' idea.

103
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,103
You're so sweet.

104
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,308
And I'm so surprised.

105
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,944
You didn't know?

106
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:42,158
Why are you over here
if Joshua's over there?

107
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,988
I'm trying to play hard-to-get.

108
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,162
Quick! He's looking.
Say something funny.

109
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,496
Like what?

110
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,530
What's so funny?

111
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,635
I said, "Like what?"

112
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,136
Now that's a thinker.

113
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:05,312
This playing-hard-to-get thing
is not working.

114
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,746
Hand me those cherries.

115
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,293
-Care for a cherry?
-No, thanks.

116
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:22,625
I can tie one of these into a knot
using just my tongue.

117
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,242
You okay?

118
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,715
You all right?

119
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,518
We should probably get going soon.

120
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,351
But the party's just getting started.

121
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:53,555
We have to be at The Four Seasons
for drinks in 15 minutes.

122
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,597
Then The Plaza for dinner.

123
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,429
So why did you plan a party
at the same time?

124
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,305
Actually, American surprise parties
are very short.

125
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:12,007
It's usually, "Surprise!"
Then, "My God, I'm so surprised. Bye!"

126
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,347
Ross, I'm having such a great time.

127
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:20,549
Your sister told me that
you used to dress up like old ladies...

128
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,260
...and host make-believe
tea parties.

129
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,733
Monica said that, did she?

130
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:32,235
Did she tell you
that when she was little...

131
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,135
...she was partially responsible for
new legislation...

132
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:39,438
...regulating the strength
of swing sets?

133
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,549
Then what are you going
to put on top of that?

134
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:52,257
-A little salami.
-Oh, yeah.

135
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,720
What goes on top of the salami?

136
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,184
Pastrami.

137
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,158
You're a genius.

138
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,666
Give me a hand with the zipper.

139
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,671
Up!

140
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:18,274
-You changed?
-I decided I needed my lucky dress.

141
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,111
-Lucky means more cleavage?
-lt does for me.

142
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,527
Look at him!
He's so cute.

143
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,667
I just want to grab him and kiss him.

144
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:40,565
How could I kiss him
without him knowing I like him?

145
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,775
I know how you can get him.
Take off your bra.

146
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,699
What?

147
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,879
-This scene in Footloose
-Flashdance.

148
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,615
-Yeah. With that plumber girl?
-A welder.

149
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,949
Were you, like, in the movie?

150
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:03,090
She takes off her bra under the shirt
and pulls it out the sleeve.

151
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,059
Very sexy. And classy.

152
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:13,602
-Or you could use mistletoe.
-It's not Christmas.

153
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,636
-Spin-the-bottle.
-He's not 11.

154
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,479
Thank you so much for this.
It was so thoughtful of you.

155
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:23,942
You're leaving?

156
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:27,947
-We have something we have to get to.
-I'm gonna take off too.

157
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,952
You can't leave yet.
You have to stay.

158
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,817
We've got the whole
big thing planned.

159
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,552
What big thing?

160
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:39,458
Spin-the-bottle works like this:
I spin the bottle.

161
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,463
Lands on Gunther,
so I would have to kiss Gunther.

162
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,630
All right.

163
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,297
Who wants to go first?

164
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:49,735
I'll go.

165
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,572
Welcome to America.

166
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,347
Oh, my God!

167
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,188
Two in a row!
You gotta use your tongues now.

168
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,299
All right.

169
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,865
What are the odds?

170
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,365
That's enough!

171
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,535
Let's let someone else play.

172
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,714
If you didn't want to play,
then why'd you come to the party?

173
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,276
All right, I'll go.

174
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:40,122
Somebody loose.
Somebody loose.

175
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,759
Story of my life.

176
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,630
Story of my father's life.

177
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,831
Okay, my turn.

178
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,436
Look at that!

179
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,008
Oh, my God.

180
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,517
The baby just kicked!

181
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,715
It's okay. It's okay.
If it kicked once, it'll kick again!

182
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,689
Everybody just remember
where they were sitting.

183
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,833
It was a bug.

184
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,610
It doesn't matter
how much I'm craving it.

185
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:40,215
You know why I'm never gonna eat meat?
Because it's cold-blooded murder.

186
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,984
Okay.

187
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,192
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!

188
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,495
What are you doing?

189
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,825
I can't help it!

190
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,035
I need the meat!
The baby needs the meat.

191
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,033
You know when you're dating someone...

192
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,233
...and you don't want to cheat
unless it's with someone really hot?

193
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,402
Totally.

194
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,810
This is the same kind of deal.

195
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,246
If you're gonna do something wrong...

196
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,444
...do it right.

197
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,751
-I'll be back in a minute.
-Okay.

198
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,596
What are you doing to me?

199
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:30,296
I'm trying to get Emily out of here,
and you keep talking to her...

200
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,097
...being all interesting
and making her laugh.

201
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,536
I don't want you to be funny anymore.

202
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:39,676
Rachel wants me to be funny,
you don't want me to be funny.

203
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:44,475
From now on, I'm gonna be funny
sometimes, and not funny others.

204
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,015
You feel better now?

205
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,218
Yeah, but at what cost?

206
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,288
Six more months, three meals a day.

207
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:03,434
I am going to eat, like,
you know, millions of cows.

208
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,861
Mommy cows, daddy cows, baby cows

209
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,203
No. No, I will never eat
baby cows. No veal!

210
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,572
Oh, but veal.

211
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:18,148
What if I even things out
for you, meat-wise?

212
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,147
-What?
-I eat a lot of meat, right?

213
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,880
But suppose, until the baby's born,
I laid off it.

214
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,558
No extra animals would die.
You'd be eating my animals.

215
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,054
I can't believe you'd do that for me.

216
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:36,095
Absolutely.
I could be a vegetarian.

217
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,926
There's no meat in beer, right?

218
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:43,702
We can still make dinner if we skip the
appetizers and ask for our check right away.

219
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,647
We can't go now.
Rachel is going to put on a skit.

220
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,482
Oh, my God!
Have you lost your mind?

221
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,920
I am finally thinking clearly.

222
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,753
My lucky dress wasn't working out
too well for me.

223
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,421
But for four years,
this baby never missed.

224
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,627
Wait, I can't let

225
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,167
Actually, I want to see what happens.

226
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,772
Nice costume.

227
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:24,778
Well, I wanted to give Emily
a big American goodbye cheer.

228
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,551
Ready. Okay.

229
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,487
Give me an "E"!

230
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,218
Give me an "M"!

231
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,928
Give me an "I"!

232
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,324
Give me an "L"!

233
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,487
Give me a "Y"!

234
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,564
What do you get?

235
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:48,104
Emily! Emily!

236
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,002
That's me as a cheerleader!

237
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,815
I loosened a tooth.
It's no big deal. I have a dentist.

238
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,519
I'll put some ice on it.
Excuse me.

239
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,517
-What do I do now?
-I think you're done.

240
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,463
Time to take off the bra.

241
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,762
That was really great.

242
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,538
But I gotta take off.

243
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,832
Take the bra off.

244
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,938
Let's go get your coat.

245
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,011
Rachel's my girlfriend.

246
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,881
So this was really fun.

247
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,888
Yeah, it was real fun.

248
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,897
You know, this bra...

249
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,028
...is really bothering me.

250
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,134
This used to be my bedroom.

251
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:03,209
A lot of memories in here.
Lot of memories.

252
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,875
If these walls could talk,
they'd say:

253
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,212
"Want to hear some memories?"

254
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,193
Need a hand?

255
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,362
I got this all under control.

256
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,991
You really don't seem like you do.

257
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,230
God! Forget it!

258
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,672
This is not how
this was supposed to happen.

259
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,247
What was supposed to happen?

260
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,253
Can you not look at me
when I say this?

261
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:51,051
I thought that
if I could get you here...

262
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,929
...I could seduce you.

263
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:00,393
-Excuse me?
-Seduce you.

264
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,549
I don't wear suits to work.

265
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,219
And I bought six of them from you.

266
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,156
I'm sorry.
I thought you needed them.

267
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:24,753
My point is, I kept coming back
because I wanted to see you.

268
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,022
-Why?
-Because I like you.

269
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,696
You like me?

270
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:37,170
I mean, you're beautiful
and smart and sophisticated.

271
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,878
A lot of this isn't based on tonight.

272
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,837
But you like me?

273
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:48,711
I can't believe this. All this time,
I liked you and you liked me!

274
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,116
-But
-No "but."

275
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:56,817
"But" is never good. Let's leave it
at "l like you and you like me."

276
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:02,055
-Okay. However
-No, that's a fancy "but."

277
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:08,530
My marriage, like, just ended.

278
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:13,039
And I'm really not ready
to get into anything yet.

279
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,571
But....

280
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,280
I'm sorry.
I just need a little time.

281
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,287
Okay.

282
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,426
There you are.
I was looking for you.

283
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:36,891
Joshua's gone,
so you and Emily are free to go.

284
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,531
It's okay.

285
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,503
She's still in there
enjoying her fake party.

286
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,104
It's too late to do
the stuff I had planned.

287
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,946
I'm sorry.
I ruined your evening.

288
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,042
Yeah.

289
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:58,586
If it makes you feel any better,
I made a fool of myself.

290
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,390
Helps a little.

291
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:06,360
Is there room on that step
for a pathetic loser?

292
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,362
Have a seat.

293
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,271
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

294
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,446
It was just a two-week thing anyway.

295
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,047
I just didn't want it
to end this way.

296
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,717
Or maybe you didn't want it to end.

297
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,380
What do you mean?

298
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,818
You seem to really like her.

299
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,020
I really do.

300
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:42,026
But what am I going to do?
We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.

301
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,099
No commitment.

302
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:53,171
That girl just spent the entire evening
talking to your friends...

303
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,845
...asking to hear stories about you...

304
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,676
...Iooking through
Monica's photo albums.

305
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,943
You don't do that
if you're just in it for two weeks.

306
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,244
You think?

307
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:10,188
You've got 14 hours
until she has to be at the airport.

308
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,625
And you're sitting here
in a hallway...

309
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,095
...with a 28-year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.

310
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,263
You're right.

311
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,608
Thanks.

312
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,615
What photo album was it?

313
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:38,182
I don't know. It was you
and a bunch of albino kids.

314
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,051
Oh, my God!
Those weren't albino kids.

315
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,287
That was computer camp!

316
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,967
-You're a pathetic loser, right?
-Oh, yeah.

317
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:57,869
Sit!

318
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,410
Hi.

319
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,015
Oh, my God. Joshua.

320
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,381
Look...

321
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,590
...all those things I said
about not being ready

322
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,327
-They're not true?
-They're all true.

323
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,064
But....

324
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,067
I love that "but."

325
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,481
Do you want to go inside
and get some coffee?

326
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,615
Okay.

327
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,253
Every time.

328
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,260
-What do you got there?
-Pastrami.

329
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,399
-You know what goes good with that?
-Corned beef.

330
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,302
I was going to say bologna.
But that's better.

331
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,347
-How about that smoked turkey?
-Okay.

332
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,448
Oh, mama!

333
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,578
-When is the baby due?
-Six months.

334
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:24,459
If a cow died of natural causes,
I could have one of those, right?

335
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,888
Not if I get there first.
