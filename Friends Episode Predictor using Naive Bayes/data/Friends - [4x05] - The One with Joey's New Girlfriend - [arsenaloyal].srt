1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,170
Joe, I don't think a four-letter word
for "ship" can be "ship."

2
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,777
I thought it was a freebie.

3
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,280
Hello!

4
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,084
What's this?

5
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:25,314
Oh, right!
It's that girl's phone number.

6
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,158
There it is.
Just a phone number...

7
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:34,298
...a really hot girl gave me.

8
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:40,098
It's no big deal. I mean,
it is her home phone number, but....

9
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,978
Almost lost this baby!

10
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:57,179
The lovely Amanda gives me her
number, and I go and drop it.

11
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,460
Thank you.

12
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:11,036
The One with
Joey's New Girlfriend

13
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,984
-When's your birthday?
-May 5th. Why?

14
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,518
I'm making a list of birthdays.

15
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,089
-Mine's December
-Yeah, whatever.

16
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:10,990
She's pretty!

17
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:14,689
Pretty, pretty girl. The pretty
She's pretty.

18
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,662
Go ask her out.

19
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,570
-What's the worst that could happen?
-I could die.

20
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,640
Yeah, it's tough being single.

21
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,041
That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.

22
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,673
Ross, you guys went out once.

23
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:36,185
You took your kids to Chuck E. Cheese,
and you didn't even kiss her.

24
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,192
I tell people secrets.

25
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,229
It makes them like me.

26
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:52,302
All I'm gonna say is, finally, it's
nice to be in a mature relationship.

27
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,168
You know, the world would
be such a better place...

28
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,277
...if that actually was
all you were gonna say.

29
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,543
Phoebe.

30
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,743
You're sick.
You shouldn't play. Go home.

31
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,445
But I'm unemployed.

32
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,281
My music is all I really have now.

33
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:16,760
Well, music and making my own shoes.
Pretty, huh?

34
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,493
All right, I'm gonna do it.

35
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,567
I'm gonna go get shot down.

36
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:27,434
Any advice?

37
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,971
Just be yourself...

38
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,142
...but not too much.

39
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,405
Wish me luck.

40
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,179
Good luck!

41
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,144
Wish it!

42
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,825
I was just sitting over there and....

43
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,261
My name's Chandler.
Did I say that?

44
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,657
No, you didn't.
Hi, I'm Kathy.

45
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,765
-Kathy with a K or a C?
-With a K.

46
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,765
Wow, you are really good at this!

47
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,902
I'm out on a limb here!

48
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,075
I'm sorry.
You're right.

49
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,768
But I should tell you,
I'm waiting for a date.

50
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,478
And there he is now!

51
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,753
I see you guys already met.

52
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,146
I was trying to demonstrate...

53
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,826
...how I could get my
very large feet...

54
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,257
...into my even bigger mouth.

55
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,993
Didn't I tell you?

56
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,457
Always showing off.

57
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,205
Before I start, I want to say
that I have a cold.

58
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:37,635
So if I sneeze during a song,
it's not on purpose.

59
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:40,971
Except the last verse of
"Pepper People."

60
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,379
Smelly cat, smelly cat

61
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,555
What are they feeding you?

62
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,959
This chick sounds good.

63
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,056
Smelly cat

64
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:02,022
Gunther, be a good little boy
and bring me a whiskey.

65
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:15,142
At 2:30 a.m., I didn't expect
to have to fight over the remote.

66
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:19,244
Sorry, there's this Ernie Kovacs
thing I wanted to watch.

67
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,146
That's why I got up too.

68
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,979
You're kidding?
I love him!

69
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,624
My dad made me stay up
and watch reruns with him.

70
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:29,387
Mine too. Did your dad also make
you watch the Mr. Universe contest?

71
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,826
-No.
-Well, me neither.

72
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:40,638
I'm sorry about this afternoon. If I had
known that you two, I never would have....

73
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,798
Oh, please.

74
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,570
Joey tells me you two met
in acting class.

75
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:50,682
They teamed us up as partners.
Joey picked three scenes for us to do.

76
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,612
All of them had us making out.

77
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:57,754
That's a good thing because he used to
make me rehearse with him.

78
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:04,295
-ls it on?
-No, but this Wonder Broom is amazing!

79
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,097
Oh, my God!

80
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,759
It's on!

81
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,208
Here we go, little fella.

82
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,742
What about the duck?

83
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,781
The duck can swim.

84
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,621
My sticky shoes

85
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,088
My sticky, sticky shoes

86
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,329
Why you stick on me?

87
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,463
Baby

88
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,826
Thanks for the lights, honey.

89
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,602
Way to go!

90
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,743
Your cold makes you sound great.

91
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,607
It's fun.
God, I love how sexy I am!

92
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:03,110
Kath, we should get going.
We're going to buy hamsters.

93
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,582
I love them.

94
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:09,158
No, it's not like that.
I work for a medical researcher.

95
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,224
-Well, have fun.
-Okay.

96
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,098
It's nice that
the medical community...

97
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,327
...is trying to help sick hamsters.

98
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,204
-lsn't it?
-Yeah, it's great.

99
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,338
You know what?
I like Kathy.

100
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,581
Me too!
She's so cool and pretty.

101
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:30,805
She is.

102
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,314
She's smart and funny.

103
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,717
We were up all last night talking.
She said the funniest thing about

104
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,820
What?

105
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,453
You love her.

106
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,520
No, I don't.

107
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,130
Yes, you do.
Chandler loves Kathy.

108
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:52,637
-Come on, just lay off him.
-Thank you.

109
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:56,535
He's a little sensitive right now
because he's so in love!

110
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,403
All right.

111
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,647
Kathy, I love you!

112
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:18,257
I need to write some depressing stuff
to go with my new bluesy voice.

113
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,989
But nothing that sad has
ever really happened to me.

114
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,327
How about your mom dying?

115
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,232
Or having to live on the streets
when you were 14?

116
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,905
I could write about the time
my hair did that whoo-hoo thing.

117
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,550
I'm going over to Amanda's tonight.

118
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,481
Rachel's not here.

119
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,122
How's it going with her?

120
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:51,157
Great, actually. I'm thinking
tonight may be the night.

121
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,198
The kids are gonna play together,
and then when they're asleep...

122
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,301
...I'm thinking Amanda and I break
open a bottle of wine...

123
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,596
...do a little playing ourselves.

124
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,668
Hi, guys! This is Josh.

125
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,471
Josh, these are my friends.

126
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,375
And that's Ross.

127
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,748
Dudes.

128
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,615
You played in college?

129
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,450
I still do.
Next year, I hope to make varsity.

130
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,661
Didn't you play soccer
in high school?

131
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:29,334
No, wait. You just organized
their game schedules on your Commodore 64.

132
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:34,496
It's getting late. I gotta get
to the game, so I'm gonna...head.

133
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,442
I'll miss you.

134
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:42,909
Dope!

135
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,110
Wow! Cute one.

136
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,586
-Very cute.
-I know. Isn't he great?

137
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:56,284
So nice to finally be in a
fun relationship, you know?

138
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,690
There's nothing boring about him.

139
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,161
I bet he's never set foot
in a museum.

140
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,162
Maybe he'll get to go soon.

141
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,937
Like on a class trip or something.

142
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,205
You know what else is
great about him?

143
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,376
What is the word for an adult...

144
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,172
...who doesn't have dinosaur
toys in their bedroom?

145
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:22,949
What was that?

146
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,281
Monica knows.

147
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,153
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up
to try to fool our parents.

148
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:32,320
It's a way of giving the finger
without actually having to give it.

149
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,396
I cried the night you made that up.

150
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:40,468
It was the first time I realized
I was cooler than my big brother.

151
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,038
I'm going to go get ready...

152
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:52,346
...for my date tonight...

153
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,348
...so I'll just "head."

154
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,487
I should go too.
I'm playing in one hour.

155
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,992
You guys should come hear me.

156
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,726
Hear me.

157
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,898
My sticky shoes

158
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,598
I lost my sexy phlegm!

159
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,242
Hi, Ben.

160
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,882
-You look great!
-Thanks.

161
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,213
Hey, Tommy!

162
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,685
I am so glad that you
could come over tonight.

163
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:35,087
Oh, no. It's my pleasure.

164
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,954
My cell phone number
is here on the counter.

165
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,392
Please, help yourself to
anything in the fridge.

166
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,760
I appreciate this so much. I have
been trying to go out with...

167
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,561
...this guy for a month.

168
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:50,099
I'd really appreciate it if you'd
wait and drink your wine...

169
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,607
...after the kids are asleep.

170
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,319
I blocked the adult channels for the other
babysitters, but the code is four, three

171
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,752
I'm fine.

172
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,952
Thanks for this. I hope I can do
the same for you sometime.

173
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,860
Who wants to make
some long-distance calls?

174
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:31,174
Kathy!
Kathy! Hi!

175
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,384
Kathy!
Kathy!

176
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,456
Kathy!

177
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,001
Fetch!
Fetch it!

178
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,037
Kathy!
Kathy!

179
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,503
Kathy!

180
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,676
Kathy!

181
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,349
Kathy!

182
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,615
Chandler, what are you doing here?

183
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,189
I just wanted to say, "Hey!"

184
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,491
Hey.

185
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,460
Okay.

186
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,570
You're making it sound
worse than it was.

187
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,904
Her date tipped me $10!

188
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,984
What are you doing?

189
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,777
I want to be sexy again,
so I'm trying to catch a cold.

190
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,957
Should be easy.
They're pretty common.

191
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,588
You'll catch pneumonia!

192
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:55,096
Okay, you were right.
I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.

193
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,768
-What?
-Are you serious?

194
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,266
How is that possible?
You barely know her.

195
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,200
I don't know. I just

196
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,771
I can't get her out of my head.

197
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,137
I'm a very bad person.
I'm a very, very bad person.

198
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,314
I'm a horrible person.

199
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,783
"No, you're not.
We still love you, Chandler!"

200
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,351
Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.

201
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,789
You mean you stole it!

202
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,789
Don't cover your mouth
when you do that!

203
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,838
We were just talking about you.

204
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,395
Really?

205
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,866
The time you got drunk
and fell asleep...

206
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,907
...with your head in the toilet.

207
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,811
Right in there!

208
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,151
-What movie did you get?
-I got what I always get.

209
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,185
Die Hard.

210
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,725
That's what I like about Joey.
Any other guy would have been:

211
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,124
"Yeah, The English Patient
is my favorite movie too."

212
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:01,096
But Joey goes, "No way.
Let's get Die Hard.

213
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,259
I'm not watching that English crap."

214
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,061
Yeah, he's dreamy.

215
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:13,474
I gotta go.
I gotta go meet some friends.

216
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,977
He has other friends?

217
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,319
Ninety-nine...

218
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,020
...a hundred.
Ready or not, here I come!

219
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,465
Let's go over the concept
one more time.

220
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:39,465
You want to get some dinner
with me and Kathy tonight?

221
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,001
You know what?
I already ate.

222
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,232
It's 4:30.

223
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,208
I had a big meal on Monday.

224
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,974
So that'll get me
straight through the week.

225
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,417
I see what's going on here.

226
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,845
-You do?
-Yeah.

227
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,580
You don't like Kathy.

228
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,384
You got me.

229
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,859
You've been avoiding her
ever since we started going out.

230
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,226
I made an effort to like Janice.

231
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,994
Now I think it's your turn to make an effort
to like Kathy by going out with us. Right?

232
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:16,174
-Yeah, right.
-Good. And hey, my treat.

233
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,344
-Only because you're not eating, right?
-Right.

234
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,947
Sorry, Grandma.

235
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,656
Ross isn't here.

236
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,524
Stop it!

237
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,802
I'll see you at the party?

238
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,428
Beer's fear, man!
Twenty-four, seven!

239
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,813
I am so gonna marry that guy.

240
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,107
What?

241
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,482
-I think he's stealing from me.
-Why?

242
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,418
Because he's stealing from me!

243
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,859
Hi, it's me...

244
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,322
...and soup.

245
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,932
I just saw Josh. He looked so
yummy in your leather jacket.

246
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:21,761
I don't eat chicken,
so it's just noodle soup.

247
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:27,001
There's no chicken in the broth,
so it's really just noodle water.

248
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,139
-Thank you so much.
-Sure.

249
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,549
What are you doing?

250
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,689
I need your germs.
I want my cold back.

251
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,289
I miss my sexy voice.

252
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,494
Sorry, Phoebe.

253
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,354
It's okay.

254
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,189
How's the soup?

255
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:07,181
Check it out!
You can see that girl's underwear.

256
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,081
Is she great, or what?

257
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,351
What do you think?

258
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:14,753
She's not really my type.

259
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,688
Not your type?
She's gorgeous.

260
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:21,366
You know what it is?
The fishnet stockings.

261
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,866
Whenever I see a girl in fishnet
stockings, it reminds me of...

262
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,095
...my father in fishnet stockings.

263
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:32,240
Understanding a little more of
why you're single.

264
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:36,174
I have a friend you'd like. She's really
pretty. And then we could double date.

265
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,440
No, thanks.

266
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:42,745
I've got some ugly friends, and
they're all available too.

267
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,751
I'm gonna grab a beer.

268
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,286
I'll be right back.

269
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,799
-What was that?
-What?

270
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,362
Kathy's being really nice
and you just walked away.

271
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,403
What do you want from me?

272
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,268
I want you to like her.

273
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:08,445
If that's too damn difficult for you,
then the least you could do is pretend.

274
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,575
-I am pretending.
-Then do it better.

275
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,609
What do you say I go over there and
tell her how much I like her?

276
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,589
I can tell her how much
I've been thinking of her.

277
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,122
I haven't stopped thinking
about her since we met.

278
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,328
I'm so over the top,
want-to-slit-my-own-throat...

279
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:27,555
...in love with her
that for every minute...

280
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:31,827
...I can't believe my own damn bad
luck that you met her first!

281
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,568
That's pretty good.

282
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,603
But you might want
to tone it down a little.

283
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:47,179
I still have a fever? Are you
sure that thing's working right?

284
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,583
Well, we could take
it the other way.

285
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,619
So Amanda just dropped me off.

286
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,456
That's one of the things
I love about her.

287
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,600
She's old enough to drive.

288
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,735
You're not going
to Mom and Dad's tonight?

289
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,166
No, sorry.

290
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,033
Where's Amanda?

291
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,867
Could you get me
some cough drops?

292
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,375
I'm thinking you could bring her...

293
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,880
...and you guys could go up to your
old room and not make out.

294
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,550
Cough drop, please?

295
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,085
At least she's not
going out with me...

296
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,347
...to get into R-rated movies.

297
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,085
Why don't you just marry her?

298
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:34,059
Wait, you can't! I forgot.
She's not a lesbian.

299
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,900
-Amanda and I have a
-You have nothing!

300
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,866
You're not even going out!
You're her babysitter.

301
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,201
You have a 12-year-old girl's job!

302
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,583
That is so sad.

303
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:02,093
And what are you laughing at,
Miss My-keg-sucking-boyfriend...

304
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,886
...-is-stealing-from-me?

305
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,089
So he stole a couple bucks
from me. Big deal!

306
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,165
At least he got me
something with it.

307
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,098
That's mine!

308
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,774
Would you both please
start acting like adults?

309
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,480
And give me my cough drops!

310
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,173
-Fine.
-Sorry.

311
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,317
Here.

312
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,713
Thank you.

313
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:34,154
At least I made $10 in
my relationship.

314
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,491
You know...?

315
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,000
Parading goats are parading

316
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,331
Parading down the street

317
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,737
Parading goats are parading

318
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,912
Leaving little treats

319
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,578
Does it even work
without my sexy voice?

320
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,251
I like it.

321
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,412
-Gunther, kiss me.
-What?

322
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,590
Do it, deputy!
Do something!

323
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,911
We aren't exactly sleeping in here,
but do you mind?

324
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,350
Can I sleep on your couch?

325
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,837
And I'm still waiting

326
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,509
For my papier-mache man

327
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,076
Thank you, my babies.

328
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,080
Rachel?

329
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:13,719
Did you hear what happened
between me and Phoebe?

330
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:19,757
We kissed. I didn't initiate it,
but I also didn't stop it.

331
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:21,989
I've been feeling guilty.

332
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,666
Okay.

333
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,271
So...

334
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:30,196
...are we cool?

335
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,474
Okay.

336
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,975
I knew you would understand.
