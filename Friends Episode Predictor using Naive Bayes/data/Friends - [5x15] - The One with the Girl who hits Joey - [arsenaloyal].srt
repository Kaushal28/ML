1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,796
Chandler! Chandler!

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,809
I saw what you were doing
in the window!

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,037
I saw what you're doing to my sister!
Get out here!

4
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,545
Listen, we had a good run.

5
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:20,114
What was it?
Four, five months?

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,380
That's more than most people
have in a lifetime. Goodbye.

7
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:28,388
-What are you doing?
-I am going on the lam.

8
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:31,559
Come on, Chandler.
I can handle Ross.

9
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,655
Hold on!

10
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:38,328
Hey, Ross.
What's up, bro?

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,540
What the hell are you doing?

12
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:45,800
What's going on?

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,072
I think Ross knows
about me and Monica.

14
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,811
Dude, he's right there.

15
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,083
I thought you were my best friend!
This is my sister!

16
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,361
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot believe this!

17
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:06,361
We're not just messing around.
I love her.

18
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,324
I'm in love with her.

19
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,397
I'm so sorry that you
had to find out this way.

20
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,671
I'm sorry, but it's true.
I love him too.

21
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,609
My best friend and my sister!

22
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,916
I cannot believe this!

23
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,629
You guys want to probably
get some hugs in too. Big news!

24
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,190
We've actually known for a while.

25
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,799
What? You guys knew?

26
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,698
You all knew and
you didn't tell me?

27
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:55,107
We were worried about you. We didn't
know how you were going to react.

28
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,985
You were worried about me?

29
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,589
You didn't know how I'd react?

30
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,990
Okay. All right.

31
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:13,289
Let's clear out of here and let
these lovebirds get back to business.

32
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,299
I'm just talking here.
He's the one doing your sister.

33
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,604
The One With the Girl Who Hits Joey

34
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,442
You know what I just realized?

35
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,116
If you guys have kids

36
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,612
We're having kids?

37
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:06,979
I call godfather!

38
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,881
You can't just call godfather.

39
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,025
Shouldn't her brother be godfather?

40
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,696
Sure. If you cared enough
to call it first.

41
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,565
-You're a few steps ahead of us.
-Big zero gravity moon steps.

42
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,904
I just thought of
the greatest wedding gift.

43
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,801
I'll go in on that with you.
I couldn't decide.

44
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,706
Hey, Katie.

45
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,309
This is Katie.

46
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,871
You ready to go?

47
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,880
I'll run to the bathroom.

48
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,174
Where's lunch?

49
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,217
I was thinking Chinese food.

50
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:43,887
I love Chinese!

51
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,717
How did you know I love Chinese?

52
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,863
She is so cute.

53
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,089
You could fit her
in your pocket.

54
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:59,836
She could fit in that little pocket
inside the pocket.

55
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:04,766
I don't know. I like her a lot,
and she's really nice, but...

56
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,535
But what?

57
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,181
She keeps punching me.

58
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,116
In the cute, little
sweet way she just did?

59
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,880
It's a lot harder than it looks.

60
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,459
She's hurting me.

61
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,657
I know what you need.
You need a bodyguard.

62
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,865
What is Ben doing after preschool?

63
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:33,367
Joey is having a problem.
A little girl is beating him up.

64
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,301
Joey, come here.

65
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,909
Honey, I know. This must be
really difficult for you, and

66
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,840
I'm sorry, am I hurting you?

67
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,720
I brought you some housewarming gifts.

68
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,361
Salt, so your life always has flavor.

69
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,692
Bread, so you never go hungry.

70
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,897
And a scented candle for the bathroom.

71
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,695
Because, well, you know.

72
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:12,102
Thanks. Thanks.
And thanks, I guess.

73
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,910
Welcome. I'm Steve Cera,
president of the tenants' committee.

74
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:21,018
Ross Geller.
And this is my friend Phoebe.

75
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,751
Mr. President.

76
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,284
I came to talk to you
about Howard.

77
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:31,229
He is the handyman
who's retiring next week.

78
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:36,300
Everyone who lives here is kicking in
$100 as a kind of a thank you.

79
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:37,933
That's nice.

80
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,694
Want to give me a check?

81
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,444
Not now. You can
slip it under my door.

82
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,408
No, it's not that.

83
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,310
I just moved in.

84
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,446
Well, the guy's worked here
for 25 years.

85
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,215
Yes, but I've lived here
for 25 minutes.

86
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,119
Okay, I get it.

87
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:09,161
Wait! Look, I'm sorry, it's just
I've never even met Howard.

88
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,801
I mean, I don't know Howard.

89
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,665
Howard's the handyman.

90
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:19,609
Yes, but to me, he's just "man."

91
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,248
Okay. Fine. Whatever.

92
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,950
Welcome to the building.

93
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,647
Can you believe that guy?

94
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,253
I really like his glasses.

95
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:42,030
So then President Steve
told everyone I was a cheapskate...

96
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,303
...and now the whole building hates me.

97
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,995
A little kid spit on my knee.

98
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,206
And told me to wipe it off
with my $100 bill.

99
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,810
You really should wipe it off
with something.

100
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,506
You know what?

101
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,982
I'll throw a party.
For everyone in the building.

102
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:07,153
And I'll sit them all down and
explain that I am not a bad guy.

103
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:10,191
I am not a cheap guy.
I'm just a guy...

104
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,693
...who stands up
for what he believes in.

105
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,432
A man with principles.

106
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,431
Sounds like a fun party.

107
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:23,202
If you want them to like you,
why don't you just pay the $100?

108
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,172
The party will cost you more.

109
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,673
That doesn't matter!

110
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,649
It's my principles!
We're talking about my principles!

111
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,281
I thought it was about
your neighbors liking you.

112
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,354
They'll like me once
they come to my awesome party.

113
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,953
I gotta get some nametags.

114
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,401
And that crazy party animal
will be your brother-in-law.

115
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,505
Very funny.
But don't say that to Monica.

116
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,969
Don't put any ideas in her head.

117
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,913
You do realize that those ideas
are probably already in Monica's head?

118
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,048
Why?

119
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:08,217
Well, because she loves you
and because you love her.

120
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,818
Yeah, so? What's
that supposed to mean?

121
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:15,591
Don't freak out! I'm telling you
something you already know.

122
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,956
She left Richard because
he didn't want to have babies.

123
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:24,034
And she is a woman. And she's
almost 30. And, you know, it's Monica.

124
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,899
I don't see it that way.
I see two Monicas.

125
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,768
My friend who lives across
the hall and wants a lot of babies.

126
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,178
And the new Monica
who I started to date.

127
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,246
Now, who is to say what she wants?

128
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,774
I'm right.

129
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,786
Am I right?

130
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,989
Oh, absolutely.

131
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,125
I'm completely different from Richard.

132
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:50,524
He's an eye doctor,
and I don't wear glasses.

133
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,054
You're right.

134
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:58,062
You're absolutely right.
That makes everything different.

135
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,769
It's not different, is it?

136
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,200
Not unless different
means "the same."

137
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,374
You were so funny with that waiter.
You're such a nut!

138
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,223
You know, bread-stick fangs
are always funny.

139
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,551
No, you make them funny.
You're the funny one!

140
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,725
Look, Katie.
Listen, we need to talk, okay?

141
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,026
Look, I like you.
I really do. I like you a lot.

142
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,472
But sometimes when you
playfully punch me like that...

143
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:41,907
...it feels like I'm being hit
with a very tiny but a very real bat!

144
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,581
Like I could hurt you.

145
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,651
Are you making fun of my size?

146
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:52,824
Don't make fun of me
because of my size!

147
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,060
Isn't this great?

148
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,394
Couldn't you just
stay like this forever?

149
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,174
Couldn't you just stay here forever?

150
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,243
Yeah, here, somewhere else.
You know, wherever.

151
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:16,503
Are you okay?

152
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,142
I'm cool.

153
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,816
Casual.

154
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,083
What are you doing?

155
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:26,822
Just hanging out. Having fun
with the girl that I'm seeing casually.

156
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,154
Man, I knew it!
I knew you'd do this.

157
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,319
What?

158
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:36,093
Get all freaked out because
everybody was joking about marriage!

159
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,762
Well, you do want
all that stuff, right?

160
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,473
You know what I want?

161
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,643
Yes! You want babies!
You have baby fever!

162
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,807
I do not have baby fever!

163
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,880
You're obsessed
with babies and marriage...

164
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,675
...and everything that's
related to babies and marriage.

165
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:59,549
Why don't we turn the heat
down on this pressure cooker!

166
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,824
Have you lost your mind?

167
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:07,293
This isn't about me. This is about
you and your weird commitment crap!

168
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:11,993
I know you. I know the thoughts
that you have in your head.

169
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,372
You don't know everything.

170
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,076
Did you know I'm going out
with Rachel tonight instead of you?

171
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,369
And that the only baby here is you?

172
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,673
Did you know I can't even
look at you now?

173
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,378
I did not know that.

174
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:37,120
It'll be okay, right?
She won't leave me. This is fixable.

175
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,387
-Yeah, sure.
-Absolutely.

176
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:40,723
By me?

177
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,572
Unless you make some big gesture.

178
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,729
Big, though.

179
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,498
The missus!

180
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,742
Gunther, can I get a coffee?

181
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:57,905
To go.

182
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,686
I still don't want to talk to you.

183
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,251
Tell me how to make things right.

184
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,255
That's what we do.

185
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,519
I mess up, you tell me
how to fix it and I do.

186
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,195
And then you think I'm cute again.

187
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,825
I'm really tired of being
your relationship tutor.

188
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,004
Figure this out for yourself.

189
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,766
If you're afraid
of a real relationship...

190
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,943
...then don't be in one.

191
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,677
Howard! Howard! Howard!

192
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,028
Hi, Ross!

193
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,734
What are you doing here?

194
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:26,665
I thought this was your party,
and it's a party for Howard.

195
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,874
He's the sweetest little man.

196
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,944
See you, Phoebe.
And thanks for chipping in.

197
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,611
Oh, sure.

198
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,038
You chipped in?

199
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,739
Yeah, $100.

200
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,910
I can't believe you gave him money.

201
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:46,387
I thought you agreed it was unreasonable
that they asked me for that money.

202
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,889
But they didn't ask me.

203
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:52,727
I'm just the exotic, generous stranger.
That's always fun to be.

204
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,558
But you're making me look bad.

205
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,931
No, I'm not! If anything,
I'm making you look better.

206
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:02,539
They'll see you
talking to me. I'm a hit.

207
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,209
Hey, Phoebe!

208
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,035
Hey, Ross.

209
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,609
Maybe you two could
switch apartments.

210
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,443
Because Phoebe is more
our kind of people.

211
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:13,946
Think about it.

212
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,451
Okay, my bad.

213
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,107
You look big.

214
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,478
Thanks, I've been working out.

215
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,245
Listen, is it obvious
I'm wearing six sweaters?

216
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,013
But it's not obvious why.

217
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,957
I'm breaking up with Katie,
so I put on some extra padding.

218
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:57,356
If she hits me when she is happy,
can you imagine how hard she'll hit...

219
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,121
...when I take away the Joey love?

220
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,999
Oh, right. I forgot that you call it that.

221
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,904
Hey, cute jacket.

222
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,634
Thanks.

223
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,074
-That's so sweet!
-Ouch!

224
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:24,455
Did Joey tell you to say that?
You guys are too much!

225
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,960
You know what?
I gotta tell you...

226
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,890
...I think you're the one
that is too much.

227
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,231
Joey has the nicest friends.

228
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,470
And the nicest girlfriend.

229
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,907
You're so sweet!

230
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,000
You're so sweet!

231
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,419
She just kicked me.

232
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,783
Aren't you going to do something?

233
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:07,096
Do something or I'll walk
out that door right now.

234
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,025
Are you going to?

235
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:36,389
This is a disaster.
Can't I please just go?

236
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,391
I'm talking you up to people.

237
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,292
Give it some time, relax.
Get something to eat.

238
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,870
What did you tell them about me?

239
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,632
I told them about you and Emily.
Trying to get some sympathy.

240
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,003
But you came off as the bad guy.

241
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,342
I told it wrong.

242
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:03,185
We should talk about that because
I don't understand what happened there.

243
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,249
This cake is really good!

244
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,493
Things are looking up.

245
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:14,062
Oh, my God!
Someone cut Howard's cake!

246
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,263
Who would do a thing like that?

247
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,372
3B.

248
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,615
You got your free food.
You ruined everyone's fun.

249
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,580
Isn't it time you went home?

250
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,455
Go back to 3B, 3B.

251
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:44,394
Everyone, calm down!
I have something that I'd like to say.

252
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,759
Who here likes Ross?

253
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,530
Of course you don't like him.

254
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,537
He didn't give you any money.

255
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:01,209
He raised his own hand
when I asked, "Who likes Ross?"

256
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,547
And he's wearing two nametags.

257
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:10,821
I'll be honest. When I first met Ross,
I didn't like him at all.

258
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:16,425
Once I got to know him,
I saw that he is really sweet...

259
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:20,061
...and caring and very generous.

260
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:24,099
All I'm saying is, don't judge
Ross before you get to know him.

261
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:29,239
You know, I like all of you guys now.
But when I first met you, you know?

262
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,773
Kurt? I thought, abrasive drunk.

263
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,135
Lola?

264
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,608
Mind-numbingly stupid.

265
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,614
You guys. Gold digger,
cradle-robbing perv.

266
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:49,121
So I think you all know what I mean.

267
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,626
Obviously, I didn't think
they would throw things.

268
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,705
I thought if I kept insulting them
you'd defend them.

269
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,933
Then you'd look like the hero.

270
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,543
See, I did not get that.

271
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,146
Where's Monica? I need
to talk to her, it's urgent.

272
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,185
I'm Monica.

273
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,485
I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

274
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,194
I've been thinking...

275
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:29,194
...about us. A lot of "us" thinking.

276
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,531
I guess there's
only one way to do this.

277
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,576
What are you doing?

278
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:41,974
Don't do it.

279
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:43,746
Will you marry me?

280
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,086
What a bad idea.

281
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,323
I can't not look at it.

282
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,223
Why are you doing this?

283
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,928
I don't know.

284
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,031
But I know I'm not afraid to do this.

285
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,726
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?

286
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:12,407
Do you think the best reason
to get married is because you're sorry?

287
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,545
The best reason is pregnancy.

288
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:23,186
Sorry is fourth, behind being ready
and actually wanting to get married.

289
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,580
Will you be my wife?

290
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:33,631
I want you to take a minute and think
about how ridiculous this sounds.

291
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,064
I'm kind of wishing
everyone wasn't here now.

292
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,903
None of that came from me.

293
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:48,704
I never said I wanted to have babies
and get married!

294
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:52,144
I was really confused.
Then I talked to these guys.

295
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,715
Who? Two divorces and Joey?

296
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,246
She's right, you know?

297
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,792
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!

298
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,463
You know when I said
that I want you...

299
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,793
...to deal with relationship stuff
all on your own?

300
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,231
You're not ready.

301
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,667
I didn't think I was!

302
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,600
Oh, my God.

303
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,774
What would you have done
if I had said yes?

304
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,950
I would've been happy because...

305
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:29,915
...I would spend the rest of
my life with the woman I love.

306
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:34,455
Or you would have seen
a Chandler-shaped hole in that door.

307
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,931
Will you pass that knife?

308
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,928
No, I will not.

309
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,398
You don't have to be mean about it.

310
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,706
You're right. I'm sorry.
Will you marry me?

311
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:57,004
I was going to ask you to marry me
because I didn't say hello to you.

312
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,084
Or ask them to move in with you.
But I'm not sure. Chandler?

313
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,745
How long is this going to go on?

314
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,014
I think the length of teasing...

315
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:11,594
...is directly related to how insane
you were. So a long time.

316
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,219
This is fun!

317
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,897
Remember that
"we were on a break" thing?

318
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,295
I'm sorry.
Will you marry me?

319
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,375
That's not funny.
