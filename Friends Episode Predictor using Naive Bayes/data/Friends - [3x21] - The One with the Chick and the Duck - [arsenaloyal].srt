1
00:00:02,381 --> 00:00:05,373
So whose idea was it to put
everybody in the diner on skates?

2
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:08,611
Some idiot customer put a suggestion
in the suggestion box.

3
00:00:08,854 --> 00:00:11,789
-Oh, my God! They took my idea!
-That was you?

4
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:14,256
Okay, there you go.

5
00:00:14,893 --> 00:00:16,724
Rachel, l made you a cocoa.

6
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:18,419
Oh, that's so--

7
00:00:20,198 --> 00:00:22,598
Oh, my God! Are you guys okay?

8
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:27,402
Oh, my.

9
00:00:31,143 --> 00:00:32,132
The One With a Chick and a Duck

10
00:01:18,957 --> 00:01:20,788
-Hey.
-Hey.

11
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,588
You know, with that goatee,
you kind of look like Satan.

12
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:29,159
So that's why the priest
threw holy water on me.

13
00:01:30,902 --> 00:01:32,961
Okay, listen, you have to cheer up.

14
00:01:34,206 --> 00:01:35,935
You should come out with Ross and me.

15
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:39,009
Anything is better than sitting
here crying all day about Kate.

16
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:44,480
l was crying because
nobody believed Quincy's theory.

17
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:48,080
l'm gonna be on TV!

18
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:49,481
-No way!
-Yeah.

19
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:53,484
They're putting together a panel
to talk about these fossils in Peru.

20
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:55,284
The Discovery Channel's filming it!

21
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:59,224
Oh, my God!
Who's gonna watch that?

22
00:02:00,732 --> 00:02:02,359
-Thanks. You ready to go?
-Yeah.

23
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:04,631
l saw a girl with that vest.

24
00:02:04,903 --> 00:02:05,927
Thanks.

25
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:12,603
Most of us think of chocolate bunnies
and baskets as traditional Easter gifts.

26
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:15,905
Some people insist on
giving live chicks as presents.

27
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:22,213
Unfortunately, most of these little guys
won't live to see the 4th of July...

28
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:25,720
...because, as a result of improper care,
they will be dead.

29
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:28,055
You guys got any of those baby chicks?

30
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,789
l was watching this commercial on TV,
and, man, those things are cute!

31
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:37,123
-Hi.
-Hi.

32
00:02:37,302 --> 00:02:40,760
Pete, you're back!
Hey, check this out!

33
00:02:41,073 --> 00:02:43,098
Skates!

34
00:02:46,578 --> 00:02:50,344
You're a lot sturdier than Chandler.
He crumbled like a piece of paper.

35
00:02:50,649 --> 00:02:51,673
So how was your trip?

36
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:54,508
What'd you bring me?

37
00:02:55,854 --> 00:02:59,153
Hotel toiletries from Japan!

38
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:02,051
These are gonna go
in my permanent collection.

39
00:03:02,227 --> 00:03:04,661
You know what that says in English?
Made in Texas.

40
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:09,625
-Want some coffee?
-Yeah, sure. That'd be great.

41
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:13,734
Regular or decaf?

42
00:03:14,606 --> 00:03:16,164
Whichever's closest.

43
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:20,610
-So ask me what l did today.
-So, what did you do today, Pete?

44
00:03:20,812 --> 00:03:23,337
l bought a restaurant, and l'd
like you to be the chef.

45
00:03:23,515 --> 00:03:25,346
What?

46
00:03:30,222 --> 00:03:32,417
Can you believe he
offered me a restaurant?

47
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:35,718
What a jerk.
You want me to kick his ass?

48
00:03:36,428 --> 00:03:39,295
This has been my dream since
l got my first Easy-Bake Oven...

49
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,192
...and opened Easy Monica's Bakery.

50
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:52,438
l would kill for this job.
l can totally do this job...

51
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:56,408
...and God knows, l've paid my dues.

52
00:03:57,816 --> 00:04:00,580
But Pete's just doing this
because he has a crush on me.

53
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:02,686
You're still not attracted to him at all?

54
00:04:02,854 --> 00:04:07,621
No. l mean, how could l accept
a restaurant from him? l can't.

55
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:11,021
l couldn't accept a necklace
from Stu Vincent in the 7th grade.

56
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:15,325
But, Mon, that was totally different.
He was your health teacher.

57
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:17,727
What, honey?

58
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:21,100
My side still hurts from when
you crashed into me yesterday.

59
00:04:21,273 --> 00:04:22,900
Oh, God, l'm so sorry.

60
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:24,403
Oh, God!

61
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,971
Hey, you guys. Guess what?

62
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:33,409
Got a job on a riverboat?

63
00:04:35,487 --> 00:04:38,786
You know what? l didn't wear this suit
for a year because you hated it.

64
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:41,016
You're not my girlfriend
anymore, so....

65
00:04:41,226 --> 00:04:43,490
l see. So this suit is making a point.

66
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:47,994
Now that you're on your own, you're
free to look as stupid as you'd like.

67
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,725
You like it, right?

68
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:53,359
Absolutely! l like it even more on you
than l did on Colonel Sanders.

69
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:55,967
Ross, l'm kidding. Come here.

70
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:57,836
-What were you gonna tell us?
-Yeah.

71
00:04:58,043 --> 00:05:01,706
-Was it how you invented the cotton gin?
-Okay, goodbye.

72
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:06,012
-Was that a little harsh?
-Are you kidding?

73
00:05:06,184 --> 00:05:08,584
Remember when you used to wear
that gray sweat suit.

74
00:05:08,753 --> 00:05:10,550
And l used to call you the Hindenberg.

75
00:05:11,523 --> 00:05:13,252
No.

76
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:16,718
My mistake.

77
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:20,324
So after you put the suggestion
in the box...

78
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:23,592
...how long did it take
for the roller skating to happen?

79
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:24,757
About three months.

80
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:29,463
Okay, so l guess that's about two
weeks before the topless thing kicks in.

81
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,543
-Hey.
-Hey.

82
00:05:35,046 --> 00:05:38,277
l got you something.
Open it! Open it!

83
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:41,877
Okay.

84
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,451
lt's a chicken.

85
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:50,024
lt's cute, huh?

86
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:52,560
You guys, do you know
anything about chicks?

87
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:55,025
Fowl? No.

88
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:57,665
Women? No.

89
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,068
They are a huge responsibility.

90
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:04,106
Especially at this age.
They require constant care.

91
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:07,505
They need just the right food
and lots and lots of love.

92
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:10,271
Well, no problem there.

93
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:16,845
Easy, Lenny.

94
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,590
So, l mean, have you thought about it?

95
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,192
Okay, here's the thing.

96
00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:29,296
Oh, no. Not ''the thing.''
l hate ''the thing.''

97
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:30,762
What's ''the thing''?

98
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:33,293
l can't do it.

99
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:35,840
l'm sorry. l wish l could...

100
00:06:36,007 --> 00:06:38,771
...but you have these feelings for me.

101
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:41,171
Wait. That's what you're worried about?

102
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:44,347
lf that's the problem,
we've got no problem.

103
00:06:44,516 --> 00:06:49,010
l was gonna tell you this over dinner,
but l met somebody else on my trip.

104
00:06:50,622 --> 00:06:53,557
Her name's Ann. She's a journalist.
We met on the plane.

105
00:06:53,725 --> 00:06:55,090
She asked to finish my peanuts.

106
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,388
l thought she said something else.
We had a big laugh.

107
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,498
Yeah, l just--
l mean, l got tired of waiting.

108
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:08,901
That's great. l'm sorry,
but l'm so happy for you.

109
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,367
-And now l can work for you!
-l guess you can.

110
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:15,545
Oh, my God! This is incredible!

111
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:19,975
You know what? l'm gonna roll
right into that office and quit!

112
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:21,809
All right!

113
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,050
-Could you give me a little push?
-Yeah, sure.

114
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:27,350
-Good luck!
-l'm quitting!

115
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:33,928
l'm okay! l'm all right!

116
00:07:37,202 --> 00:07:40,933
That's exciting.
You went to Japan, made up a woman.

117
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,833
What?

118
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:46,908
l'm just saying, this woman,
l mean, she's fictitious, no?

119
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:50,111
-Why would you say that?
-You're still into Monica.

120
00:07:50,281 --> 00:07:53,273
You said there's somebody else,
so she'd agree to work with you.

121
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:56,748
lf you spend a lot of time together,
maybe something might happen.

122
00:07:58,223 --> 00:08:00,123
You're good. You're good.

123
00:08:00,992 --> 00:08:04,052
No, l'm fairly intuitive and psychic.

124
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:06,453
lt's a substantial gift.

125
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:10,461
Listen, can you promise me
that you won't tell her though?

126
00:08:10,735 --> 00:08:14,364
Absolutely. l promise.
Tell her what?

127
00:08:15,306 --> 00:08:16,568
Thanks a lot.

128
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:19,605
No, l'm serious.
l'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.

129
00:08:21,913 --> 00:08:23,972
Okay, but this is the last time.

130
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:27,584
With a chick-chick here
And a chick-chick there

131
00:08:27,752 --> 00:08:30,448
Here a chick, there a chick
Everywhere a chick-chick

132
00:08:30,622 --> 00:08:32,715
Chicken

133
00:08:34,225 --> 00:08:35,783
-Hey.
-Hey.

134
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,518
How's she doing?

135
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:38,953
She?

136
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:41,292
Yeah, don't you think it's a she?

137
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:43,498
l don't know.

138
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:56,273
l can't tell. Whatever it was
went back in too quickly.

139
00:08:57,816 --> 00:09:00,979
Anyway, l gotta go change.
l'm meeting some of the cast for drinks.

140
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:02,346
Excuse me?

141
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,609
What?

142
00:09:04,055 --> 00:09:06,182
l stayed home while
you were at rehearsal...

143
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,949
...so somebody could be here
with our chick.

144
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:13,230
Who was up from 2:00 this
morning until 5:00 this morning...

145
00:09:13,498 --> 00:09:15,489
...trying to get her back to sleep?

146
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:18,058
You don't think l get up
when you get up?

147
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:20,466
Oh, here it comes.

148
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:24,233
Yes! Here it comes!
l'm stuck here all day!

149
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:27,534
And then you come in
and spend two seconds with us.

150
00:09:29,347 --> 00:09:32,714
And then expect to go off
gallivanting with your friends?

151
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:34,908
Well, l don't think so, mister!

152
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,114
l need to relax, okay?
l was working all day.

153
00:09:39,924 --> 00:09:43,018
And you don't think
taking care of our chick is work?

154
00:09:45,763 --> 00:09:48,254
That's not what l said.
l just meant--

155
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,094
l know what you meant!

156
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,041
Have you noticed that ever since
we got this chick...

157
00:10:00,545 --> 00:10:03,378
...we've been fighting
a lot more than we used to?

158
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:08,384
l don't know. Maybe we weren't
ready to have a chick.

159
00:10:09,988 --> 00:10:11,785
l sure want one someday though.

160
00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:15,116
l know. l know.

161
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,228
l'll take her back tomorrow.

162
00:10:18,396 --> 00:10:21,194
You think we'll get our $3 back?

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,298
-Hey.
-Hey.

164
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,139
-l can't believe you still have that.
-We're taking her back.

165
00:10:28,306 --> 00:10:31,173
No, that ridiculous thing on your face.

166
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:33,071
-Thank you.
-All right?

167
00:10:33,244 --> 00:10:36,441
l have that TV thing in, like, two hours,
and l need your help, okay?

168
00:10:36,681 --> 00:10:40,742
What do you think?
This blue suit or this brown one?

169
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,784
The brown one brings out your eyes.

170
00:10:42,987 --> 00:10:45,182
But your butt looks great
in the blue one.

171
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:48,520
Really?

172
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,604
That aspirin dance really works.

173
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,014
-Oh, my God. ls that still...?
-l'm fine. l'm fine.

174
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:13,114
-No, you're not!
-Yes, l am.

175
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:16,080
Look, l'm fine. Watch. Look at that.

176
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:20,722
You've got to go to a doctor, okay?

177
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,894
l have got to get ready and go
to a dinner at my boss's house.

178
00:11:24,062 --> 00:11:26,360
There's a lot of people there
that l have to meet.

179
00:11:26,531 --> 00:11:29,659
l'm sure you'll make a great
impression. ''Hi, l'm Rachel Greene.

180
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:32,268
lt's nice to meet you.''

181
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:34,802
Come on, you probably
have a broken rib.

182
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:38,374
l will go to the hospital tomorrow.
lt'll still be broken then.

183
00:11:38,576 --> 00:11:41,067
But you know, l could use a hand
getting ready.

184
00:11:41,246 --> 00:11:43,009
Look, either help me or go.

185
00:11:43,581 --> 00:11:44,912
Fine. l'll go.

186
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:48,715
Okay, but before you go,
could you help me first?

187
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:54,717
Sure. l'll help you.

188
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:59,188
Good! Do you guys know how
to get a chick out of a VCR?

189
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:14,067
You know what?
l cannot do this with my left hand.

190
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,747
Would you please help me
with this too?

191
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:26,753
-Okay, let's use this brush.
-Okay.

192
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,115
-This stuff?
-Careful.

193
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:30,318
-Okay.
-Light.

194
00:12:30,628 --> 00:12:34,928
Just sweep it across the lid.
Just sweep it.

195
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,828
Sorry!

196
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:39,094
That's just poking me in the eye.

197
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,498
l'm sorry. Close.

198
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:42,740
-Just sweep it.
-l'm sweeping.

199
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:45,006
Sweep, sweep.

200
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:47,535
Okay, now make it even
because we don't....

201
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:48,701
What?

202
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,906
l don't want it to be too much.
l want it to be subtle.

203
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,017
You don't wear enough of this.

204
00:12:58,356 --> 00:13:02,190
Since when do you think
l don't wear enough of this?

205
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,088
Close your eye.
You're gonna like this better.

206
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:08,731
-Close, close.
-Blow it.

207
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,599
Sorry. Because l think this will make
you a little more sophisticated.

208
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:16,163
Sophisticated like a hooker?

209
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:20,237
-Hey.
-Hey.

210
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:22,174
-Guess what l'm doing tonight.
-What?

211
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,314
l'm checking out
the restaurant with Pete.

212
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:26,983
Monica, l am so excited for you!

213
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:29,684
l have to tell you something.

214
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:32,512
-What?
-l can't tell you.

215
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:37,787
Wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell
me something that you could tell me?

216
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:39,986
Well, sure, in a perfect world.

217
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:45,667
But no. l promised l wouldn't tell,
and l swore to all my gods.

218
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,537
Does it have to do with
Ross and Rachel?

219
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,175
No.

220
00:13:52,343 --> 00:13:54,334
-Does it have to do with Joey?
-No.

221
00:13:54,512 --> 00:13:58,004
Does it have to do with Chandler
and that sock he keeps by his bed?

222
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:02,183
No, but let's come back to that later.

223
00:14:06,357 --> 00:14:09,849
There you go!
Good enough for your party?

224
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,162
Sure.

225
00:14:17,902 --> 00:14:24,068
Sure. l'll just sit next to
the transsexual from purchasing.

226
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:26,938
Come on!
Okay, come on.

227
00:14:27,111 --> 00:14:30,171
All right, l gotta go,
so good luck at the party, okay?

228
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:33,282
Oh, wait. Ross, could you just stay
and help me get dressed?

229
00:14:35,753 --> 00:14:37,118
Sure. Okay.

230
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:41,347
Okay, great. Okay, just turn around.

231
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:42,782
What?

232
00:14:43,027 --> 00:14:44,551
l don't want you to see me naked.

233
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:49,132
Rachel, l've seen you naked a million
times. l ate hot fudge off you naked.

234
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:52,495
l sucked that mini-marshmallow
out of your bellybutton.

235
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:56,499
Yeah, but that was different.
We were going out then.

236
00:14:56,741 --> 00:14:58,470
Now it's weird.

237
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:02,201
Rach, you know, l can see
you naked anytime l want.

238
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,438
What?

239
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:08,583
All l have to do is close my eyes.
See?

240
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:15,284
-Ross, stop that!
-l'm sorry.

241
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,395
Come on! l don't want you thinking
of me like that anymore.

242
00:15:18,596 --> 00:15:20,325
Sorry. Nothing you can do about it.

243
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:23,090
lt's one of my rights
as the ex-boyfriend.

244
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,603
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!

245
00:15:29,874 --> 00:15:32,001
l'm sorry. lt will never happen--

246
00:15:32,243 --> 00:15:33,676
Wait a minute! Wait, wait.

247
00:15:33,978 --> 00:15:37,243
Now there are 1 00 of you,
and l'm the king!

248
00:15:38,816 --> 00:15:42,308
-Ross.
-Would you grow up? lt's no big deal.

249
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:46,483
All right. Fine.

250
00:15:50,828 --> 00:15:53,854
See what you did?
l'm gonna be doing it by myself now.

251
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:58,767
Oh, my God. All right, look, look.
Okay. Rach!

252
00:15:58,936 --> 00:16:02,167
Easy. Easy.
You have to go to the hospital, okay?

253
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,205
-Okay, l do. l really do.
-Okay?

254
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:06,933
l'm gonna get your coat,
then l'll put you in a cab.

255
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:08,941
Wait! You're not gonna come with me?

256
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,780
Of course l am.

257
00:16:14,986 --> 00:16:16,886
l just have to make a call.

258
00:16:17,054 --> 00:16:18,043
-Okay
-Okay.

259
00:16:18,222 --> 00:16:19,280
Thank you.

260
00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:26,387
What's wrong?

261
00:16:26,664 --> 00:16:30,225
l'm sorry. l just can't go
to the hospital looking like this.

262
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:33,662
-Does it involve travel?
-No.

263
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:36,099
Does it involve clogs?

264
00:16:36,374 --> 00:16:38,842
Wait, wait. Clogs or claws?

265
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:40,801
-Clogs.
-No.

266
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:42,502
-Claws?
-No.

267
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:49,151
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross
or Rachel or Chandler or Joey.

268
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:51,746
-What about Pete?
-No.

269
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:53,584
What is it?

270
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:57,087
-What about Pete?
-l don't know!

271
00:16:57,728 --> 00:17:00,094
Okay, l feel like l'm talking to Lassie.

272
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:05,760
-Phoebe, would you just tell me?
-l can't!

273
00:17:06,037 --> 00:17:08,870
-Okay, l gotta go.
-But you're so close! No!

274
00:17:09,073 --> 00:17:11,041
Does it involve
Pete's computer company?

275
00:17:11,275 --> 00:17:14,244
Just go! You're never gonna get it!

276
00:17:22,486 --> 00:17:23,748
l know.

277
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:27,617
See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth.

278
00:17:27,892 --> 00:17:30,622
She's a completely different
kind of chick.

279
00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:36,566
l love you both.

280
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:40,262
But in very different ways.

281
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:43,371
-Hey.
-Hey.

282
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:48,335
What are you doing? l thought
you were gonna take her back today.

283
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:50,503
l did. But the store
wouldn't take her back.

284
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:54,378
So then l took her to the shelter,
and you know what l found out?

285
00:17:59,757 --> 00:18:03,454
lf they can't find a home for her,
they kill her!

286
00:18:03,628 --> 00:18:05,926
l'm not gonna let that happen
to little Yasmine.

287
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:12,166
Okay, good, good, good, because l was
kind of having second thoughts too.

288
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:16,295
Okay, and it's not just chicks.
lt's all kinds of other animals.

289
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,065
That's horrible.
You did the right thing, man.

290
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,302
Thanks. l'm glad
you see it that way.

291
00:18:33,824 --> 00:18:35,348
Funny story!

292
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:40,154
l don't believe this!

293
00:18:40,398 --> 00:18:43,697
Look at this refrigerator!
lt's gigantic!

294
00:18:43,868 --> 00:18:47,668
l mean, l could live in this thing!
l'd be cold, but l'm always cold!

295
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:52,865
Oh, my God! Look at these spider
burners! l love spider burners!

296
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:54,534
So you like it?

297
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:58,545
lt is so perfect!
Thank you so much.

298
00:18:58,749 --> 00:19:00,239
You're welcome.

299
00:19:06,924 --> 00:19:08,357
Did you just smell my hair?

300
00:19:09,593 --> 00:19:11,925
No! No way! What? No.

301
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,527
-Oh, God.
-What?

302
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,067
You still have feelings for me,
don't you?

303
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:22,169
No, l'm just excited about
the restaurant, that's all.

304
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,531
-Pete.
-Okay, l love you. ls that so bad?

305
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:28,941
No, it's not bad.
lt's not bad at all.

306
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,011
lt's really nice.

307
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:35,246
The only one who stands to get hurt
is me, and l'm okay with that.

308
00:19:36,387 --> 00:19:38,048
You may be okay with getting hurt...

309
00:19:38,222 --> 00:19:41,453
...but l am not okay with being
the one who hurts you.

310
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,089
That's why l can't take this job.

311
00:19:45,362 --> 00:19:46,522
What?

312
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:50,596
We probably shouldn't
see each other anymore.

313
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:52,934
l'm sorry.

314
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:55,368
Okay, yeah.

315
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:59,566
l mean, if that's
really what you want, okay.

316
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:04,404
Okay, bye.

317
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:13,354
-l'm sorry things didn't work out--
-Shut up for a second...

318
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:16,220
...and let me just see something.

319
00:20:29,507 --> 00:20:30,940
You'd tell me the truth, right?

320
00:20:31,242 --> 00:20:35,303
-Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
-Okay.

321
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,111
Okay, now you stay out here,
and you think about what you did!

322
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:45,344
-That's a duck!
-That's a bad duck!

323
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:50,692
How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?

324
00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:53,187
What thing? What thing?

325
00:20:53,364 --> 00:20:56,094
Nothing. There was this thing
at the museum. Come on.

326
00:20:57,001 --> 00:20:58,093
Easy.

327
00:20:59,804 --> 00:21:04,264
Now, when you come back, l hope you
remember that that chick is not a toy!

328
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:10,343
What thing? What is this thing?

329
00:21:10,614 --> 00:21:14,914
l was kind of supposed to be on TV
tonight for the Discovery Channel.

330
00:21:15,486 --> 00:21:17,351
Oh, my God!

331
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:19,350
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?

332
00:21:19,623 --> 00:21:22,319
Because l knew that if l told you,
you'd make me go...

333
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,621
...and l knew you needed someone
to be with you tonight. Come on.

334
00:21:27,498 --> 00:21:29,864
-l cannot believe you.
-What?

335
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:33,036
That is the sweetest thing.

336
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,847
You should get some sleep.

337
00:21:47,251 --> 00:21:49,549
