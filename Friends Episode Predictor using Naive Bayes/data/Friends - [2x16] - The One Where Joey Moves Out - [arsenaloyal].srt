1
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:05,269
Man, this is weird.

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,134
Ever realize Cap'n Crunch's
eyebrows are on his hat?

3
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:09,466
That's what's weird?

4
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:12,644
The man's been captain
of a cereal for 40 years.

5
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:17,951
What?

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,813
The spoon!
You licked and you put.

7
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:25,258
You licked and you put.

8
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:26,489
Yeah, so?

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:31,457
Don't you see how gross that is?
It's like you using my toothbrush!

10
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,697
You used my toothbrush?

11
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:39,169
Only because I used the red one
to unclog the drain.

12
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,504
Mine is the red one!

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,504
Oh, God!
Can open. Worms everywhere!

14
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:50,849
Why can't we use the same toothbrush...

15
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:53,018
... but we can use the same soap?

16
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:57,053
Because soap is soap.
It's self-cleaning.

17
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,686
The next time you shower...

18
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:03,830
...think about the last thing I wash
and the first thing you wash.

19
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,058
The One Where Joey Moves Out

20
00:01:54,883 --> 00:01:57,613
Look at you fancy lads!

21
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,244
What's the occasion?

22
00:01:59,488 --> 00:02:02,150
You know that guy on my show
that's in a coma?

23
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,120
He's having a brunch.

24
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:07,795
Ready when you are.

25
00:02:09,097 --> 00:02:11,588
I can't believe you're
actually getting tattoos.

26
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,892
You guys are getting tattoos?

27
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:17,435
But you cannot tell Ross
because I wanna surprise him.

28
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:20,505
Wow, this is wild!
What are you gonna get?

29
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:23,005
I'm getting a lily.

30
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:26,573
For my mom, because her name's Lily.

31
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:30,980
That's lucky. What if
her name was Big Ugly Splotch?

32
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:34,818
-Where you getting it?
-On my shoulder.

33
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:35,853
What?

34
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:38,255
What's on your shoulder?

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,692
A chip.

36
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:44,092
I've got a big attitude problem.

37
00:02:46,197 --> 00:02:49,030
-A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo.
-A tattoo?

38
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,564
Why? Why would you wanna do that?

39
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:55,297
You don't think
they're kind of cool?

40
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:57,473
No. Sorry, I don't.

41
00:02:57,675 --> 00:03:00,974
Why would anyone pay someone
to scar their body for life?

42
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:03,238
What if it doesn't come out right?

43
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:06,541
It's like having
a bad haircut all the time.

44
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,514
Why is everyone staring at me?

45
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:13,480
Sign this card for Dad.
Richard will be here soon.

46
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:15,556
Richard's going to the party too?

47
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,092
He's my parents' best friend.
He has to go.

48
00:03:18,363 --> 00:03:21,662
So is today the day
you'll tell them about you two?

49
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:25,927
Yeah, for my dad's birthday,
I decided to give him a stroke.

50
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:29,101
No, I think you should tell them.

51
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:32,741
I don't know how serious he is.
Until I do, I won't say anything.

52
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:35,343
I don't think
Mom and Dad would mind.

53
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:38,538
Remember when you were 9
and Richard was 30, Dad said...

54
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,581
... "God, I hope they get together."

55
00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:26,888
Shall we?

56
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,683
Okay, wait.

57
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:30,558
You know what?

58
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,887
Ross, let's switch places.
You get in the middle.

59
00:04:34,265 --> 00:04:37,564
This looks like we're trying
to cover something up.

60
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:41,432
You could come in straddling him,
they still wouldn't believe it.

61
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:45,135
We're here!

62
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:48,103
-Hi, kids!
-The children!

63
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,207
-Happy birthday, Dad.
-Thank you.

64
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,647
Happy birthday!

65
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,385
So you kids thanked
Dr. Burke for the ride?

66
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,556
Actually, Mom, I think Monica
thanked him for the both of us.

67
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:03,283
So you kids take the train in?

68
00:05:03,494 --> 00:05:05,985
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

69
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,492
Speaking of whom...

70
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:11,667
... I hear he's got some
20-year-old twinkie in the city.

71
00:05:15,473 --> 00:05:17,566
Finger cramp! Oh, God!

72
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:20,073
Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.

73
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,243
So Richard's shopping
in the junior section?

74
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:27,517
Are we still on that?

75
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:31,243
You just know she's got
the lQ of a napkin.

76
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:33,322
She's probably not even pretty.

77
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:37,288
Just young enough so that
everything is still pointing up.

78
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,694
Can you believe this place?

79
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:48,836
I know. This is a great apartment.

80
00:05:49,107 --> 00:05:51,940
In the bathroom there's mirrors
on both sides of you.

81
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,509
When you're in there, it's like
peeing with the Rockettes.

82
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:58,379
Well, there's my fantasy come true.

83
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,980
Seriously.

84
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:04,378
We were just saying, great apartment!

85
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,555
Thanks. You want it?

86
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:08,291
I'm moving to a bigger place.

87
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:10,221
You should take this one.

88
00:06:10,895 --> 00:06:12,658
Can you see me in a place like this?

89
00:06:13,231 --> 00:06:16,325
Why not? You hate park views
and high ceilings?

90
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:18,558
Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.

91
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,806
That's all right,
I saw a kitchen this morning.

92
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,030
On TV.

93
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,708
Stop talking. Okay!

94
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:30,472
-Come on, tell us!
-ls she really 20?

95
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,546
I am not telling you guys anything.

96
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:35,581
Come on, it's my birthday.
Let me live vicariously!

97
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,481
Dad, you really don't want to do that.

98
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,351
What's a little midlife crisis
between friends?

99
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:43,059
Would you let it go?

100
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:46,728
I know what you're going through.
When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.

101
00:06:46,931 --> 00:06:49,229
You got your own little speedster.

102
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,901
-Seriously, it's not like that.
-Tell you what.

103
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:57,107
Maybe one of these weekends
you can borrow the car and I could

104
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,741
Dad, I beg you not
to finish that sentence!

105
00:07:00,078 --> 00:07:01,773
What? I'm kidding!

106
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,913
You know I'd never let him
touch the Porsche.

107
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:13,854
Okay, Rach.

108
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,227
Which lily?
This lily or that lily?

109
00:07:17,862 --> 00:07:20,126
-Well, l
-I like this lily.

110
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,798
It's more open
and that's like my mom.

111
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,535
She had a more open, giving spirit.

112
00:07:26,037 --> 00:07:28,028
Foghorn Leghorn!

113
00:07:29,774 --> 00:07:31,969
Blonde girl?
You're in room two.

114
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,701
Not-so-blonde girl, you're with me.

115
00:07:35,113 --> 00:07:36,671
Here we go!

116
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,182
You're not going.

117
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:42,643
Is this because of what Ross said?

118
00:07:45,523 --> 00:07:48,014
-Well, yeah, maybe.
-I don't believe this.

119
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:52,127
Is this how this relationship works?
Ross equals boss?

120
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:55,493
Come on, what is this, 1922?

121
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,465
What's 1922?

122
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,260
Just, you know, a long time ago.

123
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:05,269
When men used to tell women
what to do a lot.

124
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,137
Then there was suffrage, which was
a good thing. But it sounds horrible.

125
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,982
Do you want this tattoo?

126
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:16,210
Yes, I do.
It's just that Ross

127
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:19,222
Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

128
00:08:22,493 --> 00:08:24,051
Who is the boss of you?

129
00:08:25,563 --> 00:08:26,723
You?

130
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,358
You are the boss of you!

131
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:33,537
You march in there and
get that tattoo on your hip!

132
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,537
Go!

133
00:08:38,537 --> 00:08:41,537
We don't get my tatoo yet,
you know it's a little tough.

134
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:48,840
How you doing?

135
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:50,708
I'm a twinkie!

136
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,048
Really? I'm a hero.

137
00:08:56,755 --> 00:08:58,416
This is so hard.

138
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,716
Yeah, I know. I hate it too.

139
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:04,655
Look, maybe we should just tell them.

140
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,592
Maybe we should just tell
your parents first.

141
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,895
My parents are dead.

142
00:09:10,936 --> 00:09:13,200
God, you are so lucky!

143
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,998
I mean
Well, you know what I mean.

144
00:09:17,943 --> 00:09:19,877
Just hang in there, okay?

145
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:23,207
Okay, I'll go out first, all right?

146
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,919
Judy! Going to the bathroom.
Good for you!

147
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:38,893
Thank you, Richard.
I appreciate the support.

148
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:44,093
Honey.

149
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,862
Seen my Harmon Kille brew bat?
Bob doesn't believe I have one.

150
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,573
I have no idea.

151
00:09:50,242 --> 00:09:52,574
Did you know Richard
has a twinkie in the city?

152
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:57,880
I know. He's a new man.
It's like a scene from Cocoon.

153
00:09:58,784 --> 00:10:01,947
I just never would have
pictured Richard with a bimbo.

154
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,087
He told Johnny Shapiro
that she's quite a girl.

155
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,885
He told Johnny that he thinks
he's falling in love with her.

156
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:11,585
-Really?
-I've never seen him this happy.

157
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,263
So, Jack...

158
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:16,394
...ever think about trading me in
for a younger model?

159
00:10:16,635 --> 00:10:18,660
Of course not.

160
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:21,497
With you, it's like
I've got two 25-year-olds.

161
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:27,672
Oh, Jack, stop!

162
00:10:27,913 --> 00:10:29,744
Come on!

163
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:32,917
It's my birthday!

164
00:10:37,122 --> 00:10:38,316
Can we drop this?

165
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:40,753
I am not interested
in the guy's apartment.

166
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:45,156
Oh, please. I saw the way
you were checking out his moldings.

167
00:10:45,464 --> 00:10:46,362
You want it.

168
00:10:46,631 --> 00:10:48,690
Why would I want another apartment?

169
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:51,128
I've already got
an apartment that I love.

170
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,497
It wouldn't kill you
to say it once in a while.

171
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:01,211
All right. You want the truth?
I'm thinking about it.

172
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:03,939
-What?
-I'm sorry.

173
00:11:04,216 --> 00:11:07,049
I'm 28. I've never lived alone...

174
00:11:07,285 --> 00:11:10,220
...and I'm at a place
where I got enough money...

175
00:11:10,455 --> 00:11:11,979
...that I don't need a roommate.

176
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:15,451
I don't need a roommate either.

177
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,185
I can afford to live here by myself.

178
00:11:18,463 --> 00:11:22,058
I may have to bring in somebody
once a week to lick the silverware.

179
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:25,396
Why are you getting
so bent out of shape?

180
00:11:25,637 --> 00:11:27,901
We didn't agree to live
together forever.

181
00:11:28,206 --> 00:11:29,798
We're not Bert and Ernie.

182
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:34,910
I am awared that we are not gay parpens.

183
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,002
You know what?

184
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:40,008
If this is the way you feel...

185
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:42,078
...then maybe you should take it.

186
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:45,177
-That's how I feel.
-Then maybe you should take it!

187
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:46,215
Maybe I will!

188
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,885
-Fine with me!
-Great!

189
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:50,851
You can spend more quality time
with your real friends...

190
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:52,719
...the spoons!

191
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,853
Whose drink can I freshen?

192
00:11:57,564 --> 00:11:59,429
Almost time for cake!

193
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:11,735
Mon, are you okay?

194
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:15,446
You remember that video
I found of Mom and Dad?

195
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,782
Well, I just caught the live show.

196
00:12:24,664 --> 00:12:26,791
-Hey, there.
-What?

197
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:31,403
Nothing. I just heard
something nice about you.

198
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:33,529
Really?

199
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:40,134
-Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?
-Not that I know of.

200
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:43,837
I was thinking, why doesn't
he give Monica a call?

201
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,318
That's an idea.

202
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:52,649
Well, actually,
I'm already seeing someone.

203
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:54,087
Oh?

204
00:12:58,164 --> 00:12:59,995
She never tells us anything.

205
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:02,667
Ross, did you know
Monica's seeing someone?

206
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:06,234
Mom, there are
so many people in my life.

207
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:09,434
Some are seeing people
and some aren't.

208
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:11,404
Is that crystal?

209
00:13:14,113 --> 00:13:15,944
So who's the mystery man?

210
00:13:16,682 --> 00:13:19,014
Well, he's a doctor.

211
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:20,685
A real doctor?

212
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,081
No, a doctor of meat.

213
00:13:23,856 --> 00:13:25,847
Of course he's a real doctor.

214
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:27,685
And he's handsome.

215
00:13:28,594 --> 00:13:31,358
And he's sweet,
and I know you'd like him.

216
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:33,565
Well, that's wonderful.

217
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:41,698
Mom, it's okay.

218
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:42,875
It is, Judy.

219
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:44,576
Jack!

220
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:49,141
Could you come in here for a moment?

221
00:13:49,715 --> 00:13:50,647
Now!

222
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:54,145
-Found it!
-I'll take that, Dad.

223
00:13:57,823 --> 00:14:02,453
It seems your daughter and Richard
are something of an item.

224
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:06,296
That's impossible.
He's got a twinkie in the city.

225
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:08,791
I'm the twinkie.

226
00:14:09,402 --> 00:14:11,563
-You're the twinkie?
-She's not a twinkie!

227
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:14,801
Look, this is the best relationship
I've been in

228
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:17,736
Oh, please! A relationship?

229
00:14:17,977 --> 00:14:19,410
Yes, a relationship!

230
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:21,842
For your information,
I'm crazy about this man.

231
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:23,070
Really?

232
00:14:25,351 --> 00:14:28,616
Am I supposed to stand here
and listen to this on my birthday?

233
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:34,018
This is a good thing. You said
you've never seen Richard happier.

234
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:35,123
When did I say that?

235
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:39,025
Upstairs in the bathroom,
right before you felt up Mom!

236
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:42,364
Happy birthday to you

237
00:14:42,602 --> 00:14:46,129
Happy birthday to you

238
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:50,706
Happy birthday, dear Jack

239
00:14:51,177 --> 00:14:55,705
Happy birthday to you

240
00:14:57,016 --> 00:15:00,281
It looks so good!
Oh, I love it.

241
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:03,613
I know, so do l!
I'm so glad you made me do this.

242
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:05,721
Okay, let me see yours.

243
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:11,158
Let's see yours again.

244
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:14,659
We just saw mine.
Let me see yours.

245
00:15:17,536 --> 00:15:18,901
Oh, no!

246
00:15:20,072 --> 00:15:22,063
It's gone! That's so weird.

247
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,074
I don't know how, where it went.

248
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,512
You didn't get it?

249
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:31,413
Why not?

250
00:15:31,717 --> 00:15:33,184
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

251
00:15:33,386 --> 00:15:35,911
How could you do this to me?
This was your idea!

252
00:15:36,155 --> 00:15:39,716
I know! I was gonna get it,
but he came in with this needle.

253
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:42,655
And did you know
they do this with needles?

254
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:45,524
Really? You don't say?

255
00:15:45,765 --> 00:15:48,700
Because mine was licked on by kittens!

256
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,600
Serially, does it hurt a lot.

257
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
No, it's just like a pinch like that.

258
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,700
That's really hurt me, that's gonna leave a mark.

259
00:16:08,072 --> 00:16:09,539
I'm sorry about what

260
00:16:09,774 --> 00:16:11,207
-Yeah, me too.
-I know.

261
00:16:15,112 --> 00:16:16,511
Do we need to hug?

262
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:19,916
No, we're all right.

263
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,043
So I got you something.

264
00:16:24,388 --> 00:16:25,719
Plastic spoons!

265
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:31,028
-Great!
-Lick away, my man!

266
00:16:31,762 --> 00:16:35,357
These will go great in my new place
till I get real ones.

267
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,198
What?

268
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:42,032
I can't use these forever.
They're no friend of the environment.

269
00:16:42,707 --> 00:16:45,608
No, I mean what's this
about your new place?

270
00:16:46,043 --> 00:16:47,738
I'm moving out,
like we talked about.

271
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:49,945
I didn't think that was serious.

272
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:54,774
You know, I thought
that was just a fight.

273
00:16:54,985 --> 00:16:56,646
Well, it was a fight...

274
00:16:56,954 --> 00:16:59,149
... based on serious stuff, remember?

275
00:16:59,423 --> 00:17:01,550
About how I never
lived alone or anything?

276
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:04,761
I think it would be good for me.
Help me to grow...

277
00:17:05,262 --> 00:17:06,388
...or whatever.

278
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:12,262
Well, there you go.

279
00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:16,268
Hey, are you cool with this?

280
00:17:16,507 --> 00:17:18,168
I don't wanna leave you high and dry.

281
00:17:18,476 --> 00:17:20,239
I've never been lower or wetter.

282
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:24,838
I'll be fine.
I'll just turn your...

283
00:17:25,116 --> 00:17:26,640
... bedroom into a game room.

284
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:29,147
Put the foosball table in there.

285
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:33,115
Why do you get to keep the table?

286
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:37,920
I did pay for half of it.

287
00:17:41,132 --> 00:17:42,258
I paid for the other half.

288
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:45,201
I'll tell you what.
I'll play you for it.

289
00:17:46,337 --> 00:17:47,497
All right, you're on.

290
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:50,969
I can take two minutes
out of my day to kick your ass.

291
00:17:52,176 --> 00:17:55,634
Your men will get scored on
more times than your sister.

292
00:18:03,187 --> 00:18:04,779
Which sister?

293
00:18:08,225 --> 00:18:10,523
So are you sorry that I told them?

294
00:18:10,728 --> 00:18:14,858
No. It's been a long time
since your dad and I went running.

295
00:18:19,303 --> 00:18:20,327
Did you get it?

296
00:18:20,538 --> 00:18:22,369
-ls Ross here?
-He went out for pizza.

297
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:24,006
Okay, really quick.

298
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:26,698
That's great!

299
00:18:27,011 --> 00:18:28,308
Very tasteful.

300
00:18:29,313 --> 00:18:30,803
Wanna see mine? Wanna see mine?

301
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:33,009
What? You didn't get one.

302
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,878
Okay. Well then, what is this?

303
00:18:38,255 --> 00:18:39,847
What are we looking at?

304
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:42,555
That blue freckle?

305
00:18:44,228 --> 00:18:45,490
That's my tattoo.

306
00:18:45,763 --> 00:18:48,323
That is not a tattoo.
That is a nothing.

307
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:50,097
I got her in the chair...

308
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:54,235
...he barely touched her with the
needle, she screamed and that was it.

309
00:18:54,505 --> 00:18:56,097
Okay, hi!

310
00:18:58,209 --> 00:19:01,736
For your information,
this is exactly what I wanted.

311
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,377
This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen
from a great, great distance.

312
00:19:08,452 --> 00:19:11,114
It's the way my mother
sees me from heaven.

313
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:14,883
Oh, what a load of crap!

314
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,691
That is a dot!

315
00:19:17,962 --> 00:19:22,592
Your mother's in heaven going,
"Where the hell's my lily, you wuss!"

316
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:27,695
That is not a tattoo!
This is a tattoo!

317
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:33,972
You got a tattoo?

318
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,405
Maybe.

319
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:40,582
But just a little one.
Phoebe got the whole world!

320
00:19:42,653 --> 00:19:44,280
Well, let me see.

321
00:19:47,725 --> 00:19:48,657
Well?

322
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,750
Well, it's really...

323
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:53,895
...sexy.

324
00:19:54,164 --> 00:19:56,598
I wouldn't have thought
it would be, but...

325
00:19:57,468 --> 00:19:58,560
...wow!

326
00:20:01,572 --> 00:20:02,436
Really?

327
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:07,934
So is it sore?
Or can you do stuff?

328
00:20:10,748 --> 00:20:11,646
I guess.

329
00:20:12,616 --> 00:20:13,810
Save us some pizza.

330
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:22,023
Get it out of the corner!

331
00:20:23,928 --> 00:20:25,020
Pass it! Pass it!

332
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:27,463
Stop talking to your men!

333
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:31,930
And the table is mine.

334
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,701
Congratulations.

335
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:52,714
You guys will still
come visit me, right?

336
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,685
Oh, yeah! You got the big TV.

337
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:57,052
We'll be over there all the time.

338
00:20:57,895 --> 00:20:59,988
Except when we are here.

339
00:21:04,668 --> 00:21:07,694
I know you're just moving uptown,
but I'll really miss you.

340
00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:11,068
How can you not be
across the hall anymore?

341
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:15,404
Who's gonna eat all of our food
and tie up our phone lines

342
00:21:15,646 --> 00:21:17,511
Is that my bra?

343
00:21:19,717 --> 00:21:23,517
-What are you doing with my bra?
-It's not what you think.

344
00:21:23,754 --> 00:21:26,848
We used it to fling
water balloons off the roof.

345
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:31,494
Remember? Those kids couldn't
even get theirs across the street.

346
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:33,522
Yeah, I remember.

347
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,392
Let's bring the rest of these
down to the truck.

348
00:21:51,582 --> 00:21:53,209
You want me to...

349
00:21:53,684 --> 00:21:55,879
...give you a hand
with the foosball table?

350
00:21:57,621 --> 00:22:00,419
You keep it.
You need the practice.

351
00:22:02,793 --> 00:22:03,691
Thanks.

352
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:05,886
So...

353
00:22:06,764 --> 00:22:07,958
... I guess this is it.

354
00:22:08,532 --> 00:22:09,464
Yeah, right.

355
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:11,029
I guess so.

356
00:22:16,573 --> 00:22:18,040
When am I gonna see you?

357
00:22:18,275 --> 00:22:20,300
I'm guessing tonight
at the coffeehouse.

358
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:22,977
Right. Yeah. Okay.

359
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:25,539
Take care.

360
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:07,539
Hey, dad. What are you doing here.

361
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:09,939
I just stop by your boyfriend to get a piece of my mind.

362
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:13,539
-And.
-And I was got a punch on the nose.

363
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:16,539
but he has the game on, so we started to watch it.

364
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,939
then we have time, and came to find out what for.

365
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:24,539
-but he offered me a beer, you know what?
-what?

366
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:25,539
he got on tap.

367
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:29,939
when he in this apartment, 
the damn thing is build right on his part.

368
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:33,939
did you talk about me?

369
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:38,539
oh, right, actually, we never got to you.

370
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:44,539
look, you are a big girl.
I just hope you know what you are doing.

371
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:49,539
I do. Dad, you wear the tie I got you.

372
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,539
Where did you get the hat?

373
00:23:58,539 --> 00:23:59,539
I don't know.
